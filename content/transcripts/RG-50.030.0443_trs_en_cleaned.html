<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Director of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>, Paxton (ph) Manificos(ph) was exchanged from year to year from one faculty to the other was at that time the initver (ph), the name was I-N-I-T-V-E-R, and he was a theologian.</sentence><sentence id="202">He was applied by the theologian faculty and he was a priest and he was___and I told him, "You don't think that I would be crazy to start a fight; how many are we and how many are the others?"</sentence><sentence id="203">And of the newspapers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, they are largely in Jewish hands and liberal, very liberal, and they looked out for the chance to hear to have the director of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> who was a theologian and he was then finally called to this panel and he announced that I am being warned.</sentence><sentence id="204">That was all.</sentence><sentence id="205">I could have been excluded from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , because he had told me, I had told him, "You know that you really don't start this" and he said,"___I don't know."</sentence><sentence id="206">Well, he was very mild (ph) and the journalists were waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for me to come out with accusations toward the Director and I told them he was a nice man, he has a very liberal attitude so this makes a nice story, too.</sentence><sentence id="207">So they had a big story that a priest who is not radical and who is most pleasant sort and had very good press and shortly after that the Olsten (ph) party formed a coalition to look for a Minister of Social Welfare and they got him because he was accepted to the <span class="BUILDING">liberal school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">I think this has something to do with my, with my___ until I was mentioned by the and he became Minister of Social Welfare and he was one of the Olsten Provision (ph) government and then they told the Cardinal of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> died and he was well-liked by everybody, that they made him, the Pope made him Cardinal for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, but he behaved very badly, well, the, the Nazis came in and he was the first one to turn to the Nazis and publish a poster, "Heil Hitler," which he agreed very much with the regime.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Let me ask you, during these early years, did you at any time think of settling in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: The event (ph), which is just what I wanted to emphasize, Zionism was very much of a national minority that is you of it, primary understanding for national minority, so the Jews were very satisfied that the League of Nations had adopted a law for protection of minorities and</sentence><sentence id="221">this vision was that the Viennese Jews in their mass (ph) were least protected by these Jews very conscious of their Jewish culture.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: So, how specifically did you get involved specifically with the Betar movement and revisionism, which is obviously a very logical specific type of Zionism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish, whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people, and I knew about it and I was always radical.</sentence><sentence id="229">I was for the state and by then I went into the Congress, I went for the first time in 1935 to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when I was...1935, I was 29 years old.</sentence><sentence id="230">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but before this 1935 I went to the Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="231">Aisha (ph) was a friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="232">And then I heard Gobutinski's (ph) speech.</sentence><sentence id="233">But I heard him, then I formally joined, like I had heard him already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catovitz</span> (ph), which was a revisionist a few years before this, as I was very much impressed.</sentence><sentence id="234">He was a most impressive personality.</sentence><sentence id="235">I knew him well.</sentence><sentence id="236">A book came out recently by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shotz</span> (ph) in manages very permanently (ph).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: What was it about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gobutinski</span> that impressed you, that type of Zionism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: No, it was not only the Zionism, it was the personality.</sentence><sentence id="249">He was an excellent orator and then he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">Everybody went to hear him.</sentence><sentence id="251">He didn't advertise what he's talking about.</sentence><sentence id="252">They had a big placard that said, "Gobutinski's Speech", "Gobutinski ."</sentence><sentence id="253">And that was enough to have people come there.</sentence><sentence id="254">And he is not only, I don't think he could give it a specific name.</sentence><sentence id="255">Half of Zionism seems (ph) one and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Did your activities intensify between...after 1933?</sentence><sentence id="265">I mean you were very active well before 1933, but then, when Hitler came to power, at the time did you see that as a seminal event at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: I don't remember what I thought at the time.</sentence><sentence id="269">But I was very active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has been a assimilical (ph) community with the old people coming to well- to-do Jews who are running it and after that .</sentence><sentence id="271">Many not-well-to-do poor Jews from the East came in as refugees from the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the Viennese Jews and I was active in the viacom (ph) in the fight, in the fight, for getting elected into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was something entirely different than it is here or</sentence><sentence id="274">anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="275">By law, incorporation to which every Jew belongs whether they wanted to or not.</sentence><sentence id="276">And to put, they tax you.</sentence><sentence id="277">If you didn't pay your tax to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, the tax of the government taxed your property.</sentence><sentence id="278">They had very officious tactics, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">There was only one way to get out, to declare ousted (ph) of the ; "I don't want to be a Jew any more," and you were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was really direct presentation of the Jews and I was very active for, for the Zionists, for Zionists who finally got the majority.</sentence></p></dialogue>
