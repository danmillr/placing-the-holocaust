<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6">Q: Your, now when you were boarding somewhere, your parents weren't with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8">A: No, no, they remained up on the <span class="DLF">mountaintop</span> and | was all by myself and then sometimes I'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the weekend.</sentence><sentence id="9">But!</sentence><sentence id="10">was very unhappy in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in <span class="BUILDING">boarding</span> with strangers because | had actually never been separated from my parents.</sentence><sentence id="11">And | was homesick and | was crying all the time and it just wasn't working out.</sentence><sentence id="12">So we finally, my father had gone ahead and finally found us one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, just very, very primitive and we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and when we left the priest, though, | had kind of made a vow to myself that someday | wanted the world to know what he had done forus.</sentence><sentence id="13">And that wish didn't get fulfilled until 1987, when I, | found out about the and recommended him and finally got the designation of the the nations and a medal which was posthumously awarded, because he died in 1959, but in that way | felt that he had gotten the recognition that he deserved, but at the point, you know, in 1945, | didn't know, | just knew that | wanted people to know, but | didn't know anything about, didn't exist then.</sentence><sentence id="14">So we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we found that circumstances were really very bad because even though the war was over, everything was devastated, there was no coal to heat <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="15">There was very little food and so our circumstances didn't appreciably improve when we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">We were not sure what to do at this point, but my parents gave me a choice, because they felt that | was still so young, just barely 14 and 15 and | had my whole life in front of me Eva Edmands 4 [Date not labeled] Page 4 and | should decide whether we should remain in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or whether we should go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">And | had this very romantic idea, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, by that time | had seen a couple of war movies and | just, you know, | had thought everything American was just wonderful so | said, "| want to go the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>."</sentence><sentence id="18">And so we had to put our name on a list and they had a quota and we had to wait until our name reached the top the list and that took two years.</sentence><sentence id="19">So we actually didn't get to leave until 1948.</sentence><sentence id="20">In the meantime we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and | became ill because you know, lack of nourishment and you know, being run down from the war and | contracted pleurisy and | was very ill for three months.</sentence><sentence id="21">There were no, of course no antibiotics in those days and | was, there was not much help available and it just took me forever to recover from that illness and | had to stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for three months and then when it was over | found out | had lost the ability to walk, | was so weak my legs just wouldn't, wouldn't cooperate and my parents had to support me and | had to learn to walk all over again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: How about your parents, what was their health like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Not great, | mean my mother had always been in poor health and my father had a heart condition, but they kind of managed, but | was the one who, you know, who came down with this thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: How old, what were their ages?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="43">A: Well they would have been in their early 50's at the time.</sentence><sentence id="44">And so, by some miracle, | got over this very dangerous illness and then my father had found a job working for some <span class="BUILDING">movie company</span> because before the war he worked for <span class="BUILDING">MGM</span> and Eva Edmands 5 [Date not labeled] Page 5 he was writing subtitles, German subtitles for American movies.</sentence><sentence id="45">And somehow, | don't know exactly who was involved, but he had gotten a contract for one year and we were actually able to go to the <span class="REGION">French Riviera</span> and live there for a year in a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">And well he did whatever it was that he was supposed to do and that probably was one of the happiest years of my life, because we were living in a gorgeous <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my health improved and that was a very good time for me.</sentence><sentence id="47">And we had met another couple who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they still had the numbers tattoo and they had met there and they were just a few years older, so they were friends that remained when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">And then after a year we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and went through another year there and | didn't do much of anything cause couldn't figure out quite, you know, we were going to leave anyway, there was no point in my doing anything else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: How old were you at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Well, then | was 17, just a little over 17.</sentence><sentence id="60">And then finally we got word the word that our name had reached the top of the list, the quota and we could go the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Before you talk about that, talk a little bit about how aware you were of the world at that time, | mean were you, the whole time you were in hiding, did you know that, what was going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Not much.</sentence><sentence id="66">We had very little news from the outside world because we were just dependent on the clandestine BBC news and we really didn't know very much, but you know, we did find out after, afterward, | mean we had all newspapers and... Eva Edmands 6 [Date not labeled] Page 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Do you remember how, how you felt when you found out what had been going on during the war?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: No, | just, you know there are, there're gaps in my memory, you know, certain things that | remember vividly and others | don't.</sentence><sentence id="69">So | don't know really, what | thought.</sentence><sentence id="70">| guess, you know we're all so wrapped up in our personal problems and being ill, any kind of, you know, major things are less important probably, that they should have been.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: What about religion, you said your family was agnostic.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: That's right, never was given any religious training and this is something that | very much regretted later on because | felt that if they had given me some type of religious training, whatever, it, it would have reinforced a sense of identity which is something that | lacked, | really didn't know who | was.</sentence><sentence id="77">But as young as | was, all these years you know and even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was a very little girl, | had an awareness of the existence of God and | don't know how because nobody told me because my parents had a tendency to kind of downplay it and say oh well, you know, it's all myth.</sentence><sentence id="78">And | knew there was a God and | kept searching for God, and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: So at this time, when you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, you still didn't have any real religion?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: No, nothing, | didn't, you know, | mean here we were supposedly Jewish but my parents had been so assimilated into the dominant culture in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> that they considered themselves Austrian and not really Jewish at all.</sentence><sentence id="85">Asa matter of fact they were almost anti-Jewish because they had formally left the Jewish religion, you know, you can do that and it was just because they were, you know, my father considered Eva Edmands 7 [Date not labeled] Page 7 himself to be an intellectual and they just did not believe in anything.</sentence><sentence id="86">And so | didn't know anything about the religion of my ancestors.</sentence><sentence id="87">My grandparents weren't that observant, although probably more than my parents were, but each generation was more observant and that was the irony, that we were persecuted for a faith that we really didn't believe in.</sentence><sentence id="88">But the Nazis didn't make such distinctions.</sentence><sentence id="89">| didn't know anything about Judaism, | didn't know anything about Christianity, | didn't know anything about anything.</sentence><sentence id="90">So, you know, we were told that our name had reached the top of the quota and we had, we have to have a sponsor on this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">Somebody who, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, somebody who would make sure that you didn't go on welfare when you came here and so.</sentence><sentence id="92">And my uncle and aunt on, my mother's brother and his wife had managed to escape the war and go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and my uncle was a doctor and he was doing quite well, they were settled and so they said they would sponsor us and so we were able to leave and we had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it took nine days to get over there and | remember that we were all deathly ill, | didn't eat anything for nine days, | was terribly seasick and we finally, finally landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on my, in 1948, May, 1948, | was just about 17 and a half at the time and my uncle and aunt were there at the <span class="DLF">port</span> to meet us and my aunt's first words to us were, "| didn't really want you to come."</sentence><sentence id="93">Because she was that kind of person, she very much, you know her, she did because her husband said, "Well this my sister and her family, we have to."</sentence><sentence id="94">But we were always, as far as they were concerned, the poor relations and she didn't have much respect for us and she didn't want us to come.</sentence><sentence id="95">So this is how we were greeted after Holocaust and all we went through and not only Eva Edmands 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 that but they had a lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span>, New York, but they didn't put us, they didn't take us there, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> run by the Hius(ph), which was the Hebrew Immigrant Society, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> and so we spent our first night in the new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> with hundreds of other people on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">It was nota very good first impression.</sentence><sentence id="97">And then, somehow, my father found us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, just a, you know, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere and that's how we started.</sentence><sentence id="98">But my aunt was so afraid that, you know, we'd wind up costing her money that she got my mother and me a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and it was a real sweatshop downtown.</sentence><sentence id="99">It was some friend of hers was owning a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and, it was a <span class="BUILDING">bead factory</span> and we were made to string beads all day long, you know, that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="100">It was just horrible and it was very hot.</sentence><sentence id="101">It was May and it was very hot.</sentence><sentence id="102">So this, we were just kind of, is this America?We had this glorified picture and it just didn't turn out at all the way we thought it would be.</sentence><sentence id="103">And my mother and | didn't last very long in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">We were fired because we didn't work fast enough.</sentence><sentence id="105">And so we lasted only about two, three days and that was the end of that and then we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, it was, what in those days they call a <span class="INT_SPACE">railroad apartment</span>, on the very edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spanish Harlem</span>, on 98th, <span class="DLF">East 98th Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">And they were just, you know, one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> going to another and it was very primitive, we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and we went, remember we went to <span class="BUILDING">Goodwill Industries</span> and got, just a few pieced of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and my father had a really hard time getting work.</sentence><sentence id="107">You know, he was in his 50's and he spoke English somewhat but you know, when you first come here and you're immigrant, nobody's going to hire you and he had to, for a first, | don't know how long, but he, he washed Eva Edmands 9 [Date not labeled] Page 9 dishes, he did all those things, you know, just to get some money so we could survive.</sentence><sentence id="108">And the other thing was, you know, as far as | was concerned, | did not speak English.</sentence><sentence id="109">And English is now my third language because | had to learn French first, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">And so | didn't speak a word of English and yet | knew that it was very important for me to learn if | was ever going to get some work.</sentence><sentence id="111">And | wound up really supporting the family, but | guess | have a, you know, it's easy for me to learn languages and | did learn pretty quickly.</sentence><sentence id="112">So it wasn't that big a problem for me to, to learn alanguage.</sentence><sentence id="113">And then things got kind of bad because my mother became very ill.</sentence><sentence id="114">She was only in her 50's and she had a stroke, which left her permanently disabled.</sentence><sentence id="115">She had contracted TB during World War 1.</sentence><sentence id="116">And then from that she got a rheumatic heart, so her heart was not very good and she was just a tiny little woman, she was five feet and the most she ever weighed in her life was 90 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="117">And she had the stroke and so she was almost unable to, one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was paralyzed and she had trouble walking, so she was more or less homebound after that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: What about medical care?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Well she had a, we went to a doctor that we had known in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, but they didn't have things for people like, you know, as they do now .</sentence><sentence id="162">You know, there was no talk of physical rehabilitation, any of those things, we didn't have the money.</sentence><sentence id="163">| mean we would just, basically people.</sentence><sentence id="164">We never did go on welfare but we had no money, we couldn't afford any of those things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Was she <span class="BUILDING">hospitalized</span>?</sentence><sentence id="170">Eva Edmands 10 [Date not labeled] Page 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Briefly and then she was just sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she managed as well as she could athome.</sentence><sentence id="172">And of course you know we had to, couldn't leave her, we had to take care of her, take turns.</sentence><sentence id="173">So that was, that was kind of really unfortunate.</sentence><sentence id="174">She was really young and she, she really never had a life after that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: Was she aware of what was going on around her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="177">A: Oh yeah, | mean her mind was never affected, her speech was not affected, her mind, she died at 83 and her mind was clear as a bell, right to the end.</sentence><sentence id="178">And she was never one to feel sorry for herself, she always, you know, managed to ____ herself and you know, keep herself neat.</sentence><sentence id="179">And she had interests, she read, she listened to the radio and she had a lot of friends, so she was very remarkable that way.</sentence><sentence id="180">But her life was just taken away from her basically, at that point.</sentence><sentence id="181">So really my father was still having a lot of problems getting work and it was up to me to support the family.</sentence><sentence id="182">And soon as | learned English, then | started, you know, getting, looking at the classifieds in the paper and | don't know why, to this day | don't know why, but | answered an ad for somebody who wanted a bookkeeper and I'd never done any bookkeeping and math was my worst subject.</sentence><sentence id="183">But | went and it was a company called <span class="BUILDING">Home Craftsman</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">It was a magazine for hobbyists, people who like to putter around, do jigsaws at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and do all those things.</sentence><sentence id="185">And for some inexplicable reason | was hired, but after a few days they realized that | was not a bookkeeper.</sentence><sentence id="186">And the boss said to me, | don't know what you did, you know, in your and of course | had fudged, it was a matter of survival.</sentence><sentence id="187">| didn't like having to do that but it was a matter of survival.</sentence><sentence id="188">| had to pretend that | had experience because | had <span class="BUILDING">Eva Edmands 11</span> [Date not labeled] Page 11 to start somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="189">And somehow, | don't know if he felt sorry for me or what but they realized that, you know, | had not quite told the truth, but they kept me and they made me into a mail clerk and so for five years | opened mail, because they had a mail order business and I, and | just separated the orders in neat piles and count the money and the checks at the end of the day.</sentence><sentence id="190">And so | wound up staying with that <span class="BUILDING">company</span> for, for five years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: And where were you living?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: We were still living in, really a <span class="BUILDING">tenement</span> on <span class="DLF">East 98th Street</span>, we still.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: And so how would you commute?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Subway</span>, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Were you making friends at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Well, slowly, you know, very slowly.</sentence><sentence id="216">But here, one thing is that we had, we thought that we had left anti-Semitism in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the first thing that there was some friends that had come, you know, my father's friend and the first thing they told us was to me, you know | was looking for work, don't bother applying to any <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> or any <span class="BUILDING">insurance companies</span> or <span class="BUILDING">IBM</span> because they don't hire Jews.</sentence><sentence id="217">And there were certain places in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where you couldn't live, because they didn't rent to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="218">And certain <span class="BUILDING">resorts</span> where you couldn't go, that were not, that were, so | thought, "Oh, you know, here | thought we left all this behind" and a, so a strange thing happened at this point, | was really almost ashamed of having a Jewish background and so | didn't tell anybody.</sentence><sentence id="219">| told them | was French but | didn't tell them about my background of being a survivor or anything like that Eva Edmands 12 [Date not labeled] Page 12 because the Germans had done such a good job of propagandizing and making you feel like you were the scum of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span>, that so, it is so insidious that after a while, you're being told, you know, over these years, you're scum, you're scum, you wind up believing.</sentence><sentence id="220">| said, "Well maybe | am inferior, maybe I'm not good as anybody else."</sentence><sentence id="221">And so | just determined | wasn't going to tell people and you know.</sentence><sentence id="222">And at <span class="BUILDING">work</span> nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="223">The friends, | deliberately went to the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> and made friends there, Protestants, Catholics and nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="224">And | kept this up for a very long, | buried, | buried the past and just forced myself not to think about it and thinking that this would be okay.</sentence><sentence id="225">Of course it didn't work that way, but...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: What about your father, did he do the same thing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: No, | don't, | don't think, well, cause he never considered himself Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="241">You know, he had friends who knew but | don't think he made a big deal about it, you know, | don't think he went out telling people, you know I'm, no, no, he, he, he was the same way, he kind of downplayed it.</sentence><sentence id="242">And that's, you know, that's what you had to do to be accepted.</sentence><sentence id="243">| didn't really know any Jewish young people my age, all the people | knew, knew Jewish were more or less my father's age, you know, so | didn't have anybody, any connections there.</sentence><sentence id="244">Sol worked at this job for five years and then when | felt confident enough, you know, with the English language and everything, | decided | was going to look for something better and | got a job with Kodak, corporation.</sentence><sentence id="245">| don't exactly remember what it was, but it was a step up in salary.</sentence><sentence id="246">| had started, I'd started at, the Home Craftsman and | remember it was 37 dollars a week | was making there.</sentence><sentence id="247">So it was whatever | was getting, it <span class="BUILDING">Eva Edmands 13</span> [Date not labeled] Page 13 must have been 45 dollars, but it was a step up.</sentence><sentence id="248">And then, you know, | was just, | still didn't have any formal education but | went to <span class="BUILDING">night school</span>, to <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> and | learned typing and shorthand and some business English and so that, you know, gave me some type of foundation and then | had some minor jobs but the really, you know, significant job that | eventually had, after a lot of clerical jobs was with the magazine Outdoor Life.</sentence><sentence id="249">And | was doing advertising production there, keeping track of the, the ads that people send and you know the dates that this would appear in a... It was an interesting job and | had, you know, friends there and it was a nice, kind of a nice, it was really a step up at that point.</sentence><sentence id="250">My parents then managed to, my father finally got some work , although it wasn't at all in his <span class="DLF">line</span> of business.</sentence><sentence id="251">He had, was doing some freelance writing articles for foreign magazines and writing some, you know, just potboiler novels, just, you know, really to pay the rent, they were not at all what he was used to doing.</sentence><sentence id="252">But, you know, we were surviving.</sentence><sentence id="253">Not, not very well, but we were surviving and he managed to upgrade our <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">We finally moved to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on, still on the East Side, on <span class="DLF">89th Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">It was another railroad flat and of course in those days you didn't have air conditioning or, you just had plumbing, but that's about it.</sentence><sentence id="256">And heat.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1155">Q: You think you would have studied teaching?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1157">A: Yeah, | mean, if | had been able to, the other thing | always regretted, | wanted to be a librarian, but of course you know, college degree, going to <span class="BUILDING">library school</span>, it's all these dreams that | could never fulfill.</sentence><sentence id="1158">But that, yeah | probably would have gone quite a way if |, if I'd had the opportunity for the education, but in this way | felt | could make a contribution to the community.</sentence><sentence id="1159">And then...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1163">Q: And your husband was still alive during those?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1165">A: Yeah, right.</sentence><sentence id="1166">And then, we joined a <span class="BUILDING">local Unitarian fellowship</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="1167">And my husband went for awhile, but not very long, he got tired of that and he wouldn't go and | went by myself.</sentence><sentence id="1168">Made some friends there and slowly | started telling them about my background again, you know, during the Holocaust and | was a little leery because, in the midwest, you know, | always, you had this feeling, misconception that people are narrow minded and you know, you know, | was still afraid of rejection and discrimination but | found that people were so interested because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, Holocaust survivors are a dime a dozen, but here really, they don't have this access and | found out that they were very interested.</sentence><sentence id="1169">And so this encouraged me and so at the fellowship on Sunday, they have programs on Sunday mornings, they have outside speakers and speakers from their own group and so they encouraged me to give a talk.</sentence><sentence id="1170">And this is the very first time that | talked publicly about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1171">Eva Edmands 50 [Date not labeled] Page 50 And it was a great success and of course | was very nervous, I've never done, and there's another thing that | had.</sentence><sentence id="1172">| had of course, terrible stage fright all my life, even just on the, in very small groups, if | had to get up in a group of four people and make a brief announcement, | was just, my knee turned to jelly and so | thought, oh, you know, how can | face all these people?</sentence><sentence id="1173">And then again, | put this thing to work and | said, | have to do it and I'm going to conquer this and | made up my mind | wasn't going to be afraid and then | wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="1174">And from the first talk after that, | could go up there and it wouldn't matter whether there were 500 people, 100, | was not scared any more.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And some people heard me, local teachers and they ask me to speak to their students and so | built up a reputation, it was all word of mouth and at times | myself went out and contacted different groups, primarily church groups and other organizations and little by little, you know, | acquired a reputation as a Holocaust speaker and now I've been doing this since basically 1987 and to date I've kept a log but | haven't really added it up but at last count, which was last year, I'd given over 130 talks.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And now | concentrate primarily on children from grades six to 12 and I'm, you know, a registered speaker with the, our local school system, | go to all the <span class="BUILDING">secondary schools</span> and | also get calls from vicinities outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span>, you know, in the state of Kansas.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And | have, | have written the book that | had written during the war, which is translated into English, | had given to every, copies to every <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span>, so that the kids can access it in the <span class="BUILDING">public library</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="1178">And so this, during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, I'm very busy, going from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and giving talks.</sentence><sentence id="1179">Eva Edmands 51 [Date not labeled] Page 51</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1180">Q: The book, you said this book that you wrote?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1181">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mm-hm</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1183">Q: This is about your war experiences?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1185">A: This is about, it's called Childhood Memoirs of World War 2, and as | said, it's from a diary | kept as a child when | was 14 and eventually translated to English so that my husband and my friend here could read it.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And | have found that, of course I've gotten other invitations from civic groups, church groups, just a variety of groups and I've always been amazed how great the desire for knowledge is, cause people really know very little about what happened during that period.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And how warmly | am received and | have hundreds and hundreds of letters from school children, handwritten little notes to say how much they appreciated my talking and it's been my raison d'etre.</sentence><sentence id="1188">It's been a catharsis for me and | have, you know, my speech totally memorized, never refer to notes, | have visuals, | collect things out of the paper, anything having to do with the Holocaust and | keep adding to that.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And so | feel that, you know, because before | was ashamed to speak and now I'm, I'm kind of, you know, making up for that and | always tell people when | give the talks that there are some reasons why | do this, because sometimes people say, you know, "Why do you do this?"</sentence><sentence id="1190">And why you put, they think it's really difficult for me and emotional and | said, "Well, in the beginning it was, but after awhile you manage to get a certain distance, emotional distance from your subject, because if | were emotionally, you know, involved, every time | give a talk, | couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1191">And so I've had to learn to disassociate myself as though it were really not my story, it's the only way I, | can do Eva Edmands 52 [Date not labeled] Page 52 it.</sentence><sentence id="1192">And | found out that's a coping mechanism that you learn instinctively during the war is you kind of put away things that you don't want to deal with and that's a self- preservation thing.</sentence><sentence id="1193">So | tell them there are three reasons why | give this talk, is, one is to keep alive the memory of the six million victims of Hitler, including my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="1194">And two is to counter the, the revisionist lies of people who would say that, you know, there was no Holocaust, oh it was exaggerated, it wasn't as bad and then third is so it wouldn't ever happen again and in the end | ask the kids, | said, "| need your help in keeping the story alive, because we are called the last witnesses and my fear is that once, once we're gone, my generation, there won't be anyone left to keep the story alive, so I'm counting on you."</sentence><sentence id="1195">And, and you know, I've gotten these darling little letters, they said, "Don't worry Mrs. Edmands, we won't ever forget you, what you said," and you know, it was very, very, very gratifying and I've never encountered any hostility, I've talked to all different kinds of groups and they've always been most friendly, there's never any hostile comments or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1196">But the one wonderful experience | had, well one good experience was in 1990, when Father Longiree(ph), the priest who had really hidden us and saved our lives had been awarded the Medal of the Just, from Yahdvashem(ph) and then organizers in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span>), which is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> closest to where his <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> was, decided to have a commemorative ceremony for him and from some other priests who had helped people like us.</sentence><sentence id="1197">And | was invited to the ceremonies, which were held in 1990, in May 1990 and | stayed with my friend there and it was just a wonderful, wonderful ceremony, they had dignitaries from Yahdvashem(ph), from Eva Edmands 53 [Date not labeled] Page 53 Israel they had the Grand Rabbi of the <span class="REGION">region</span>, they had priests and ministers and people from the French government and some 600 invited guests and | was able to again tell, talk, tell these people, in French this time, about the priest and what he had done for us and then since he had died, his medal was awarded to him posthumously and it was given to me and | asked that the medal be put in a glass case and put in his former <span class="BUILDING">church</span> so that everybody would, would see it.</sentence><sentence id="1198">So this was one of the high points.</sentence><sentence id="1199">And then | found out about other priests and their heroic deeds and all the wonderful things they had done, so | came back with a whole collection of stories of just, you know, sheer heroism and what | was pointing out is, the heroes during World War 2 were not the generals, you know, and who won the war, like MacArthur and so on, because that was their job.</sentence><sentence id="1200">It was the little people, the little people were the true heroes.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And you, you met, you know, instances of altruism which you would never think possible.</sentence><sentence id="1202">People risking their lives and their families lives to help strangers.</sentence><sentence id="1203">At the risk of their own lives, see.</sentence><sentence id="1204">So that was, that was just a unique experience.</sentence><sentence id="1205">Then a year later, in 1991, | found out that there was a new organization formed called, for people who had been hidden as children during World War 2.</sentence><sentence id="1206">Now there already have been organizations for Holocaust survivors and they've had regular meetings but they're mostly for people who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1207">And we were a breed apart, and you know, and somebody finally recognized that, because and we were sort of a little bit disparaged by the people who'd been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, they say, "Oh well, you know, you didn't go through what we did."</sentence><sentence id="1208">And that's true.</sentence><sentence id="1209">But, on the other hand, we had a very unique problems as Eva Edmands 54 [Date not labeled] Page 54 children being hidden, having to live day after day with the terror of being discovered, being separated from your loved ones. _</sentence><sentence id="1210">It was situation all by itself and it deserved some recognition.</sentence><sentence id="1211">So the Hidden Children was formed.</sentence><sentence id="1212">They had the first international reunion of Hidden Children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Marriott Hotel</span> in 1991, three day and they had workshops and sessions.</sentence><sentence id="1213">And they had originally expected some 500 people and 1600 showed up.</sentence><sentence id="1214">From all, literally all parts of .</sentence><sentence id="1215">People came from <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span>, just all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="1216">And in addition to the former hidden children, they also had rescuers who came and for some, some were very, very elderly, some were on crutches or in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchairs</span> and for some it was their very first reunion with the, the children that they had rescued, so it was very emotional.</sentence><sentence id="1217">And | had, you know, | wanted to go, but | had mixed feelings about it.</sentence><sentence id="1218">| thought | knew all there was to know about the Holocaust, | said, oh well, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1219">And I, | was afraid in a way, stirring up all those memories, cause | said okay | talk about it, that's fine, but emotionally I'm detached, why stir up this?</sentence><sentence id="1220">But in the end, | went and | was so glad | did.</sentence><sentence id="1221">Because the minute | walked in there, | suddenly, you know, here, | who had never been raised Jewish and now all these people, all Jewish and that was such a bond, there's just immediate bond.</sentence><sentence id="1222">You felt that all these people, after just a few hours, that they were your brothers and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="1223">It was the most wonderful feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1224">A lot of them were my age, some were older.</sentence><sentence id="1225">The age ranged from 50's to you know, 70's and 80's.</sentence><sentence id="1226">First woman | met there was a woman, | mean she was a prototype of an Aryan, she was blonde hair, blue eyes, porcelain skin, Jewish, had Eva Edmands 55 [Date not labeled] Page 55 been abandoned, not really abandoned, but left by her mother in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when she was two years old.</sentence><sentence id="1227">Her mother had dropped her on <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> to save her and her mother didn't make it and she was raised by gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="1228">And so she and | met and she was very, she still had a lot of bitterness towards, you know, the Germans and cause she had then somehow found, an uncle found her and she'd found her true roots and she moved to <span class="REGION">Arizona</span>, married a Jewish man, now she's very active.</sentence><sentence id="1229">But she was very, she had a lot of bitterness about, you know, German people and, and really not knowing that much about her background cause she was so young.</sentence><sentence id="1230">But you know, there were just million stories there and we had some very inspirational speakers, we had Elie Wiesel(ph) and Serge Klaufeld(ph), the famous French Nazi hunter there.</sentence><sentence id="1231">And then we had workshops, workshops and we had a list of things we could choose, for instance, the issue of guilt.</sentence><sentence id="1232">People who felt guilty, as | did and then there were workshops for people who didn't know who they were, whether they were Christian or Jewish because they had been raised by Christians and they had this kind of schizophrenic attitude to weather.</sentence><sentence id="1233">So | went to several of <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span> and | was listening to the people talking and then | thought, this can't be, they're telling my story.</sentence><sentence id="1234">And in so many instances the stories they told were so similar to mine, they were rescued by a priest, you know . [</sentence><sentence id="1235">mean it was almost like they'd taken pages out of my book, | could not believe this, it was, it was spooky, you know, it was really spooky.</sentence></p></dialogue>

determined to kill himself.</sentence><sentence id="1428">He had, he did have a death wish, which for reasons that, you know, | will never know and he was just absolutely determined to do away with himself.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And, and | figure, well he finally got his wish and then, but | realized that life had to go one and so going on with my life and buying the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, was the first step and | had already quite a circle of friends too, my volunteer work and to other organizations, so | just really kept doing what, what | was doing before, only now | Eva Edmands 62 [Date not labeled] Page 62 didn't feel guilty about it for being away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And during the school

history, geology, so many different things, that I'll probably never be able in a lifetime to satisfy them all, but I'm fortunate that | have a nice <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and it keeps me busy.</sentence><sentence id="1434">And | try, you know, | take some trips.</sentence><sentence id="1435">And, oh, one of the main things that | wanted to relate is | had a very unusual experience last year in October.</sentence><sentence id="1436">| had, during the war, after we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, in 1940 or so, we wound up in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span>, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kalvisol(ph</span>) and there we stayed for a year when my father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> there and then, this was at the time, the free zone, the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> being occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1437">And then when the Germans broke their pact with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to, to leave part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> free and occupied the <span class="REGION">southern zone</span>, my father's life was again in danger.</sentence><sentence id="1438">And so due to a local partisan pastor, who was also the town doctor, we were able to get away cause he had made a certificate saying my father had a dangerous illness and couldn't be moved and he also arranged for my family to get fake ID's that enabled us, with fake names that enabled us to finally leave this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the rest is recorded, you know, what followed after that is recorded in the original video | made for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1439">But we had never, none of us had ever gone back, except for my father, he made a trip Eva Edmands 63 [Date not labeled] Page 63 back to that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and among other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, somewhere in the, you know, | don't know, 60's or so, I'm not sure, early 70's, but he went on his own.</sentence><sentence id="1440">And he did see this pastor and his wife and then this pastor died at age 90 in 1974.</sentence><sentence id="1441">So |, for my part, had lost all contact with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1442">And then a strange thing happened, | had given a copy of my book to the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="1443">The Archbishop wanted a copy because you know, it was about a priest and so on and then the organizers of the commemorative ceremony for the priest, with whom | had become very good friends and we'd been corresponding and they had come and visit us here, so we were really good friends by then.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And they had lent my book to a friend of theirs who was a priest and of course, he knew Father Longiree(ph), but then, when he came to the chapter that dealt with the one year that we spent in <span class="REGION">southern France</span>, the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavisol(ph</span>) rang a bell.</sentence><sentence id="1445">He said, "Oh, | know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, | know somebody who lives there."</sentence><sentence id="1446">And you know, it was such a coincidence because of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> it could have been, this particular one he knew.</sentence><sentence id="1447">And it was just a tiny hamlet.</sentence><sentence id="1448">And what happened, this man named Marcel Coulier(ph), was a young man during the war and he was hiding from, he didn't want, all young Frenchmen have to do forced labor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and those who didn't want to do that went underground.</sentence><sentence id="1449">And this priest that helped this young man hide, and they had stayed in contact and then many, many years later, you know this man had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, gotten married and then in his retirement he came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kalvisol(ph</span>) and where he was living.</sentence><sentence id="1450">And so this priest copied my chapter that dealt with our lives in <span class="REGION">southern France</span> and send it to his friends, hey look you know, this Eva Edmands 64 [Date not labeled] Page 64 talks about your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1451">And of course then, oh this is just extraordinary cause this friend shared it with, he had made some very good friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he shared it with all them.</sentence><sentence id="1452">And they were just so thrilled, because not only here's somebody had written about their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, so long ago and they said everything was accurate, the names, everything was accurate in every detail.</sentence><sentence id="1453">And of course they didn't know that their pastor had done all this cause he wasn't one to, to brag about it.</sentence><sentence id="1454">So they were terribly excited and they got in contact with me and we started correspondence and we talked on the phone and it just so happened that just at the time when they discovered my existence in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, they were planning a ceremony for the pastor because there was a new part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was <span class="DLF">street</span> that needed a name and so they decided to name the <span class="DLF">street</span> after this pastor, so everything was in place and then they found out about me and what this pastor had done, which they didn't even know, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1455">They just named the <span class="DLF">street</span> because he was a good man and as doctor he had brought many of them to life, so they want to honor him, but they had no idea what he done during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1456">So then of course they wanted me to come to the ceremony and there was just too short notice, you know, amount.| said | can't, you know, | just can't pick up and go in April, in the middle of my busiest time.</sentence><sentence id="1457">So | said, well | tell you what, they said, "Well could you write something and we could read?"</sentence><sentence id="1458">So | said I'd do that.</sentence><sentence id="1459">So | wrote a little speech in French and mailed it to them and it was read at the ceremony and they had other dignitaries and of course they told the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="1460">The newspaper picked it up and it was sucha big deal and they send me the articles and it was almost comical because it said, Eva Edmands 65 [Date not labeled] Page 65 "Jewish girl, former resident of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kavisol(ph</span>)," you know, "found living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1461">So you know, | was like, ha, it was so funny, it was the biggest thing that ever happened to them, in that of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1462">And so, and | was in contact basically with this one man who had been the organizer of the family and there were three families that were friends besides Marcel Coulier(ph) and his wife and then two other couples and they were, they had form an organization as the friends of Dr. Bonet(ph), which is the name of this pastor priest.</sentence><sentence id="1463">So all my correspondence was with them and we just became really good friends and then | started remembering names of people I'd gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with.</sentence><sentence id="1464">And | wrote it to them and he said, "Yeah that's true and they remember you."</sentence><sentence id="1465">You know, things started coming back.</sentence><sentence id="1466">And then those darling people made a video tape, not only of the ceremony, where | could just watch myself where they, while they read the speech I'd written, but they made a videotape of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and sort of going around and saying, this is <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you went to and this is that abandoned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you lived in, it's always just wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1467">But then of course they kept putting the pressure on me, they wanted to meet me and | had to promise them that | would come, you know and visit them.</sentence><sentence id="1468">And the following year | finally decided okay, it's now or nothing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1469">And | mean, they were so nice, you know, in letters so cordial, but | didn't know them.</sentence><sentence id="1470">You know, you go to a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you don't know anybody, | felt a little bit, but | said, "This is something | have to do."</sentence><sentence id="1471">Because | felt that | had honored the priest but there was still a page that had to be written in this book.</sentence><sentence id="1472">It's closure, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1473">So then | turned out that my friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span>), knew this other couple, the Eva Edmands 66 [Date not labeled] Page 66 Couliers(ph), they had become friends and so my friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span>) said, "If you come, come stay with us and then we will take you by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1474">Cause otherwise | said, you know, "How am | going to get there, it's like in the middle of nowhere."</sentence><sentence id="1475">And so that's what | wound up doing and originally | just was planning when | planned my trip, | planned, you know, two or three days because | said, "I don't know these people."</sentence><sentence id="1476">| didn't even know where | was going to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1477">And then when | wrote my dates, they said, "Oh, this will never do, this'll never do, you're going to have to stay with us for a week at least, cause we have all these plans."</sentence><sentence id="1478">And you know, you have, so | had to change all my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flights</span>, everything.</sentence><sentence id="1479">Finally went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antsee(ph</span>) and then they drove me there.</sentence><sentence id="1480">| come there and the three family met me and | mean, | mean, | felt like a rock star.</sentence><sentence id="1481">| mean, it was just the most wonderful welcome and it turned out that of the three couples, | knew the husband and wife cause I'd gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with them.</sentence><sentence id="1482">And then of course they called in the media, they had a reporter from a local paper come and interview me and they had more articles in the paper and | mean, this was big deal and they took me around and the next day to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to show me all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I'd grown up and they were so thrilled, | mean they took more pleasure and maybe even more than | did, but it was weird for me to see it, abandoned <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my family had lived.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And you know, it all looked really, basically, | mean it was upgraded, but you know, all these memories keep coming back, but they were not bad memories, you know, even though they were bad times, but it was just so good and to see the people that were so wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1484">And then they had, when | first and | stayed with one of the couples Eva Edmands 67 [Date not labeled] Page 67 and my goodness, | had a whole, practically a whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to myself, my own <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, they were pretty well off, you know it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1485">And then the first day | was there he pulled out a long list of things and complete, complete schedule, itinerary.</sentence><sentence id="1486">Every day, every hour planned, what they were going to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="1487">And they had realized that when | lived there during the war, you know, | didn't have time, | mean there was no time to go sightseeing and there are a lot of beautiful things, so they determined they're going to take me to the <span class="DLF">seashore</span>, they're going to take me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, you know, the whole bit.</sentence><sentence id="1488">So in one week we were constantly on the way, we got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> in the morning, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night and just went all around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and | saw all these things | just had heard about and they were just, | mean of course, | was totally their guest, never pay a cent for anything and | got charming gifts, | couldn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">gift shop</span> they want to buy me everything in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1489">It was, it was so wonderful and then they had organized two ceremonies, one was at the little, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where my father had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1490">There was an official reception at <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span>, | was received by the mayor, speeches, you know, the whole bit.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And then there was another ceremonies, very similar one, in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1492">Again with the mayor, the City Council, the whole bit, you know, the people coming up to me and | got a medal.</sentence><sentence id="1493">And | gota plaque and flowers and oh!</sentence><sentence id="1494">And | kept saying to them, | don't know why they're doing all this, | didn't do anything to deserve this, all | did was live there for a year.</sentence><sentence id="1495">And they said, "Oh, but you don't understand."</sentence><sentence id="1496">And then you know, sort of talking to people later, it came to me that it was more about them than it was about me.</sentence><sentence id="1497">It Eva Edmands 68 [Date not labeled] Page 68 made them feel good.</sentence><sentence id="1498">It showed them that there had been good people in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, because you see, anyone of them, they knew we were living there, anyone of them could have denounced us and nobody talked, which is remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="1499">Nobody talked.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And | guess that made them feel good and it made them and some of them were too young to even remember the war and they learned something and they actually met somebody, you know, who had lived among them and it was just a great experience for them and for me.</sentence><sentence id="1501">So it was just probably the most, the best experience of my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>

you know, this is it, for better or for worse and we could, | don't think that any, any presidential Eva Edmands 78 [Date not labeled] Page 78 candidates today, running in "96 are especially

discouraged at the, at the direction the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>'s going with the decline in the family structures, the rising crime, the, and just, the senselessness of some, you know, crimes that are committed, just for the sheer heck of it, it's, I'm not optimistic about the future of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and at times | think that I'm grateful that we didn't
