id="492">And there again, I knew, my God, I was downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="493">And I was lucky enough -- and that is why I feel that my life had many miracles.</sentence><sentence id="494">I was lucky enough that they asked, in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, "Who can speak German fluently?"</sentence><sentence id="495">And I said, "I can."</sentence><sentence id="496">And I was the interpreter between him and the Jewish girls that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">The Hungarian girls came in later on in the War, because <span

id="499">We were so undernourished, we didn't have the strength.</sentence><sentence id="500">We couldn't work on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">They were big, huge machines.</sentence><sentence id="502">So, they put a white band on my arm, and they always used me as an interpreter, between the Polish girls who did not speak German, between the Hungarian girls who did not speak German, between all the other ones who did not speak German.</sentence><sentence id="503">And he was actually nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="504">And he threw slices of bread under the machine, as he passed by, because he had to be careful.</sentence><sentence id="505">Once I got those extra few slices of bread, I was able to give my brother the bread that I got, legally.</sentence><sentence id="506">But how do I get to my brother?</sentence><sentence id="507">I cannot go downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="508">So, this SS man, when he spoke to me, and he gave me the orders, and he told me what to do, and who to tell what they have to do, he spoke to me very nicely.</sentence><sentence id="509">And I said to him, "You know what you did was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="510">And being as you are so wonderful, can you help me to get my slice of bread to my brother?"</sentence><sentence id="511">And he says, "Yes, I will. "</sentence><sentence id="512">He made me take a bomb.</sentence><sentence id="513">He put it in my arms, and says follow me.</sentence><sentence id="514">And he got me down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">lower level</span>, where my brother was working.</sentence><sentence id="515">And that was called the ; which meant that when the bomb was made upstairs, they had to use very hot <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>, to finish it off.</sentence><sentence id="516">I don't know the technical way, how they finished it off, but it was like 120 degrees in there.</sentence><sentence id="517">And my brother was there, undernourished, just as swollen as I was.</sentence><sentence id="518">And he stood there, and he watched, the other SS men wouldn't see him.</sentence><sentence id="519">And I threw that bread under that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">And my brother got the bread.</sentence><sentence id="521">And I did it as often as I could.</sentence><sentence id="522">But that was still while we were working.</sentence><sentence id="523">Now, we were shipped to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="728">Q: Was that at the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="730">A: It wasn't the first.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="732">Q: It was the one you came to with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: Right, that was -- that was .</sentence><sentence id="735">No, it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="736">That was .</sentence><sentence id="737">And we had -- now one day, I came back from work, and I was picked out to be hung.</sentence><sentence id="738">And myself, two more girls, and three guys.</sentence><sentence id="739">Because they thought I brought something into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, like food, or something.</sentence><sentence id="740">And they said, they are going to fool around with us anymore.</sentence><sentence id="741">You are going to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="742">You are going to be killed by -- we are going to hang you, right here, and when all the prisoners come in, they are going to see the example, what can happen to you, to any one of you, if you date brig anything into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, like a slice of bread, or a raw potato, or a raw beet, that we found in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">So, it was another miracle.</sentence><sentence id="744">As it happened, my brother walked by, and he saw.</sentence><sentence id="745">I was standing there.</sentence><sentence id="746">And he knew I was going to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="747">But, as luck wanted it, there was an SS man, from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, who came to oversee how they can torture more and take a lesson, the way <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="748">That Latvian SS man knew who I was, that I was in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">And as he walked by, in the Latvian language I asked him to save me, and somehow it worked.</sentence><sentence id="750">He saved me.</sentence><sentence id="751">The others were hung.</sentence><sentence id="752">And he saved me.</sentence><sentence id="753">He told the other SS men not to kill me.</sentence><sentence id="754">And it was like God sent somebody to take this person, to live, which was another miracle.</sentence><sentence id="755">And we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="756">And they were going to -- they were going to give us a well-known <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, which was -- we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="757">They told us they were going to give us a regular <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="758">We have not had <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> or anything, or toilet paper, or anything.</sentence><sentence id="759">So, they chased us into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">We were totally naked.</sentence><sentence id="761">They put up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="762">It was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fashion show table</span>, like a <span class="DLF">runway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">And we had to walk naked on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">And the SS men -- they sat on both sides, and they looked at our bodies, whether we were worthwhile saving, or being gassed.</sentence><sentence id="765">I had this horrible rash, that I knew I was going to be gassed, because the gas was for -- the rash was from malnutrition and dirt.</sentence><sentence id="766">Naturally, we were shaved, so therefore, we couldn't have anything in the hair.</sentence><sentence id="767">And I hid behind my girlfriend, and walked in step into step, so the front of my body wouldn't show how bad it was.</sentence><sentence id="768">Then came the other miracle.</sentence><sentence id="769">I was young.</sentence><sentence id="770">And to the right was the showers.</sentence><sentence id="771">To the left was to go -- we didn't know where it was going.</sentence><sentence id="772">But as they -- as we stood there, to put our clothes on again, we heard the screaming of the women, because we didn't know what way they were being killed.</sentence><sentence id="773">We knew they were screaming because they were being killed.</sentence><sentence id="774">And that was with the gas.</sentence><sentence id="775">It came out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower heads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="776">Later we saw, when the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened, there were ten <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower heads</span>, many of them over the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="777">And turned on the gas, and by the time they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I peeked in, we all peeked in, all of them were dead on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="778">That was a sight.</sentence><sentence id="779">That was just unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="780">That was worse than the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>, because once those women went in there, they didn't know what was going to hit them, until -- just screaming.</sentence><sentence id="781">They inhaled the gas.</sentence><sentence id="782">And I was saved again.</sentence><sentence id="783">I was alive, still.</sentence><sentence id="784">When we were shipped to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>, like I told you before, we did not know when the end was going to come.</sentence><sentence id="785">But, we did not lose our hopes.</sentence><sentence id="786">Because we thought, why isn't President Roosevelt doing something for us?</sentence><sentence id="787">We thought that President Roosevelt was our savior.</sentence><sentence id="788">We thought -- we heard that he was going to save us.</sentence><sentence id="789">Nobody saved us.</sentence><sentence id="790">There was no way for anybody to be saved.</sentence><sentence id="791">And we knew we were going to die, which, at that time, was actually a relief, because we were starved to death.</sentence><sentence id="792">We had no -- nobody, I didn't know, except for the one brother.</sentence><sentence id="793">We didn't know if they would come out dead or alive.</sentence><sentence id="794">But every morning at ten o'clock, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming down, very low.</sentence><sentence id="795">And always circling around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, which I later found out, that was the American Amny, taking pictures, exactly.</sentence><sentence id="796">They knew that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="797">And they were trying to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, but to avoid bombing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, which actually was the case.</sentence><sentence id="798">They did not bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="799">One day they chased us out, and they said that we had to go and pick something up.</sentence><sentence id="800">I think they said it was for food, because we had assigned women who did the food -- picking up the food.</sentence><sentence id="801">And as we went to pick up the food, we saw on the other side of the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, that there were some, a pile full of rotten beans, laying there.</sentence><sentence id="802">They absolutely devoured it.</sentence><sentence id="803">We grabbed it.</sentence><sentence id="804">We ate it.</sentence><sentence id="805">It was pink.</sentence><sentence id="806">It tasted like the most wonderful thing in the world, because we were -- we just couldn't exist any longer, from the hunger alone.</sentence><sentence id="807">It was -- we stayed there for a while, and then we heard that the war is towards the end.</sentence><sentence id="808">How we got that information, we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="809">I don't know how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="810">Now, the SS women who knew me, they used to entertain the SS men.</sentence><sentence id="811">And there was no radio.</sentence><sentence id="812">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally bombed out.</sentence><sentence id="813">There were no lights, no radio.</sentence><sentence id="814">They did not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> like today, with batteries.</sentence><sentence id="815">So, I entertained the SS men.</sentence><sentence id="816">They wanted somebody to give them music.</sentence><sentence id="817">So, they used to get me out of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="818">And they used to take me in, and put me behind a curtain, or behind a piece of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="819">And I used to stand for them, and sing for them, German songs, which was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="820">I thought it was the greatest thing, because that would give me more life, which it did.</sentence><sentence id="821">It actually did.</sentence><sentence id="822">It actually -- every, like I said -- every time they counted for the others, they always put me aside.</sentence><sentence id="823">It was very good.</sentence><sentence id="824">It was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="825">But they had no mercy.</sentence><sentence id="826">They knew that in the very end, that regardless of what happens, that we are all going to go.</sentence><sentence id="827">Tape

their rations, of their food, a toothbrush, I asked for.</sentence><sentence id="1501">I hadn't brushed my teeth for years.</sentence><sentence id="1502">And he brought us a bar of chocolate, to us was -- it was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="1503">I mean he did not eat -- now I know it was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Hershey bar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1504">And you know how it is cut?</sentence><sentence id="1505">We ate little crumbs of it, so it would last longer.</sentence><sentence id="1506">And -- before we walked out, the German found out that there were Jews hiding in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1507">Now we hear them.</sentence><sentence id="1508">And how can we hide from them?</sentence><sentence id="1509">So, it was like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubby</span>, with steps originally going up, and underneath is always a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubby</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1510">And we all crawled into that <span class="INT_SPACE">cubby</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1511">And we did not breathe.</sentence><sentence id="1512">So the did not hear us.</sentence><sentence id="1513">And they said in German, "We knew there are Jews here, but where are they?"</sentence><sentence id="1514">And they walked out, luckily.</sentence><sentence id="1515">And when we walked out, we met the American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1516">Now, the rest of our group found out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is empty, but there is some food, some food.</sentence><sentence id="1517">So they went back there to get the food.</sentence><sentence id="1518">And they were caught, because the Nazis came back.</sentence><sentence id="1519">It was not quite over.</sentence><sentence id="1520">And I told my brothers, we are not going back.</sentence><sentence id="1521">We are staying right here.</sentence><sentence id="1522">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="1523">And I think in the last minute they killed a few people who we were with, because they thought the war was still not over.</sentence><sentence id="1524">That particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was not liberated for them, yet.</sentence><sentence id="1525">So, we decided to stay there, and we'll wait.</sentence><sentence id="1526">And we'll be walked out.</sentence><sentence id="1527">And then one -- I don't know where I got my brains, but I decided that we cannot eat a lot, 6 because that would kill us.</sentence><sentence id="1528">It killed quite a few of my friends, that I was with, because we were so undernourished, our stomach was so -- could not conceive or accept that much food.</sentence><sentence id="1529">And I did it for my brothers, as well.</sentence><sentence id="1530">And thank God that he did it, because a lot of them overate.</sentence><sentence id="1531">They ate too much.</sentence><sentence id="1532">There was nothing much to be had, but people ate potatoes, which was like cake.</sentence><sentence id="1533">And from then on in, they stayed there, when we were liberated and we tried to find the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to live.</sentence><sentence id="1534">And start to work for papers, to go someplace.</sentence><sentence id="1535">Because we didn't want to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1536">The memories were horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1537">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were bloody.</sentence><sentence id="1538">There was no need to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1539">So, we arranged it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1635">Q: In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, do you think it was easier for women, than men?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1637">A: That's a good question.</sentence><sentence id="1638">No.</sentence><sentence id="1639">It was only easier if you were young enough.</sentence><sentence id="1640">Because they eliminated anything under 13, and over 30 were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1641">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1642">I shall also never forget, in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latvian concentration camp</span>, a few of the mothers had their children.</sentence><sentence id="1643">They were like ten years old, nine years old, five years old.</sentence><sentence id="1644">And then they came one day and said, "We are going to take your children.</sentence><sentence id="1645">We are going to take them to a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they are going to be given more things than you have.</sentence><sentence id="1646">So we are going to put them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1647">And we are going to ship them over to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1648">And the mothers, and we all knew it was for death.</sentence><sentence id="1649">Now, these mothers -- I had a friend that I knew through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, she had a child.</sentence><sentence id="1650">They actually hung onto those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> -- it was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1651">They piled them up, standing up.</sentence><sentence id="1652">They were hanging on, to whatever they could hang on.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And they were dragged along, until they had no more strength, and their arms couldn't hold them up, and they fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, because they knew their children were going to death.</sentence><sentence id="1654">And these children were crying, screaming for their parents, crying for their mothers. "</sentence><sentence id="1655">Mama, mama, please, save me."</sentence><sentence id="1656">You know, it was -- it was -- it was just horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1657">And they were eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And they eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="1659">They kept on eliminating, over 30 of them.</sentence><sentence id="1660">They had one young boy who went through the whole thing with us, and we all saved him.</sentence><sentence id="1661">When they counted us, we shoved him -- he was little, we shoved him between us, we covered him with our upper parts of our jackets.</sentence><sentence id="1662">And then, when we had to go anywhere, the mother of this child somehow or other, she sewed up -- you know our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> -- we had a straw covered with burlap.</sentence><sentence id="1663">That was our 7 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1664">And we helped her take that burlap and sew it up, and she covered him, and pretended it was like sugar, or flour, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1665">And it was her child.</sentence><sentence id="1666">He was the only child that we saved.</sentence><sentence id="1667">He is still alive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1699">Q: How long was he hidden there, with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1701">A: He was hidden with us.</sentence><sentence id="1702">He was like a big, big thing.</sentence><sentence id="1703">Because they escaped taking him, plain as day.</sentence><sentence id="1704">When they took the children away, somehow or other, they didn't get him.</sentence><sentence id="1705">When all these kids were shipped away, and they were all killed, and he was the only child, we found later on, was living.</sentence><sentence id="1706">And we weren't going to let him die.</sentence><sentence id="1707">So, we all fought for his life, and he survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1715">Q: Did you hide him during the day, when you guys went off to work; or was this when you weren't going to work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1717">A: We were going to work.</sentence><sentence id="1718">We were hiding him.</sentence><sentence id="1719">Somehow or other, he was hiding under the last -- the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1720">So we were hiding him there, and wherever -- wherever we could.</sentence><sentence id="1721">There's a lot to say about people who go through horrors, how your mind works, how you really can do -- like the day when they were sending all -- there was another incident when they were sending everybody somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1722">And they were counting everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1723">And there was a <span class="DLF">drain</span>, where the water runs down?</sentence><sentence id="1724">And I left myself -- I put myself into that.</sentence><sentence id="1725">I lifted that.</sentence><sentence id="1726">I don't even know how I was able to lift up that <span class="DLF">iron drain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And I put myself, my body, into it.</sentence><sentence id="1728">And I held on to the -- to those iron things, and I saved myself.</sentence><sentence id="1729">Because, your mind is -- it's the animal instinct, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1730">If you want to live, that you can use so much imagination, to really save yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1731">There are so many things -- I mean there were so many things happening.</sentence><sentence id="1732">There was a man -- the oldest one in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1733">And he was -- also he played, he was a musician.</sentence><sentence id="1734">| think he was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellist</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="1735">And they beat the hell out of him, the Jewish guy, the one that wore the thing on his arm.</sentence><sentence id="1736">He couldn't get off his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, to go to be counted, because he was so sick.</sentence><sentence id="1737">He was only 50 years old, and he was the oldest.</sentence><sentence id="1738">So, he Absolutely -- they beat him, with that black police stick.</sentence><sentence id="1739">And he crawled out to be counted, because if you wouldn't -- because if the number would be off, then we would be killed, at least 10 of us, for one person.</sentence><sentence id="1740">How -- you couldn't escape, but they would say, where is he?</sentence><sentence id="1741">You know.</sentence><sentence id="1742">So, the men dragged him out.</sentence><sentence id="1743">We weren't counted together.</sentence><sentence id="1744">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> were counted.</sentence><sentence id="1745">To say it was easier for a woman than for a man, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1746">I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="1747">I think it was equally as hard, because -- very, very -- it is actually up to the individual.</sentence><sentence id="1748">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, where we were working in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were made, there was a friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="1749">He was my age.</sentence><sentence id="1750">And he turned out -- he is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="1751">He is a violinist.</sentence><sentence id="1752">He plays every instrument.</sentence><sentence id="1753">And he was little enough, and I was little enough and they used to give us great food there.</sentence><sentence id="1754">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1755">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farina</span> was cooked for 250 people, in one big kettle.</sentence><sentence id="1756">It was about seven feet tall.</sentence><sentence id="1757">So in order to clean that, you have to get <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1758">So, my main friend, at that time we were not being together, but we still had a little contact in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we worked.</sentence><sentence id="1759">So, he used to clean the inside of the pot, and I used to clean the outside of the pot, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1760">And it was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1761">And we had an , what they called .</sentence><sentence id="1762">He was the main -- the manager of the entire thing, the SS 8 man.</sentence><sentence id="1763">He was more than an ordinary SS man.</sentence><sentence id="1764">He had a higher rank.</sentence><sentence id="1765">He was the main man.</sentence><sentence id="1766">And all of a sudden, we hear screams.</sentence><sentence id="1767">And he brings in this guy, puts him in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and shoots him, kills him.</sentence><sentence id="1768">That was so strange to us, because that was the first place that we were working at, and going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1769">And we couldn't ask him, why did you kill him?</sentence><sentence id="1770">He felt like it.</sentence><sentence id="1771">He found him and he wasn't working at that moment, so he took him to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and he killed him.</sentence><sentence id="1772">And that was for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And he was nice.</sentence><sentence id="1774">He was a nice SS man.</sentence><sentence id="1775">He wasn't so bad, because he had -- and you want to hear the best?</sentence><sentence id="1776">When the War was over, he said, when the Americans liberated us, he said he was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1777">And you know what?</sentence><sentence id="1778">He lived for a while.</sentence><sentence id="1779">He lived.</sentence><sentence id="1780">And when they asked him how could you be Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="1781">He didn't look like a German, he had dark hair.</sentence><sentence id="1782">He put on the striped clothes, and he said, "I'm Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="1783">He says.</sentence><sentence id="1784">So the American says, "What was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1785">So, naturally he could describe everything that was going on, because he was part of it.</sentence><sentence id="1786">And the American Army was lenient.</sentence><sentence id="1787">We knocked our brains to find the Nazis, after we were liberated, and when the fellows brought them -- they found them and brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span>, and expected for them to be killed, they wouldn't kill them.</sentence><sentence id="1788">The Americans didn't kill them.</sentence><sentence id="1789">Because now I know why.</sentence><sentence id="1790">They have to have enough proof, to know whether or not he was really a capo or an SS man.</sentence><sentence id="1791">So, that's -- there are so many episodes, that we would -- if we sat now, for another eight hours, I could tell you, but I do try to choke it out.</sentence><sentence id="1792">I try very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1793">And I hope I will be able, but as I get older, I find it more difficult, to be very honest.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And the biggest pleasure, for me, is to speak to you right now, and to be able to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and to see the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1795">Because that is absolutely the greatest thing I have seen.</sentence><sentence id="1796">The man who designed it, the architect, the people who had the pictures, who saved it, who found it, or what they did, is unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="1797">The shoes, the original things that are in that <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1798">I am so angry at myself, that to save myself, that I took off my striped clothes, and I threw it away.</sentence><sentence id="1799">And I put something on, so I wouldn't be recognized as a prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1800">And I put the kerchief on my head.</sentence><sentence id="1801">I am sorry I don't have that jacket.</sentence><sentence id="1802">But my brother saved it.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And he gave it to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1804">That is where he lives.</sentence><sentence id="1805">And he has his number on it.</sentence><sentence id="1806">And it is his jacket.</sentence><sentence id="1807">And it is written in that <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, that that belonged to the prisoner so and so, and so and so.</sentence><sentence id="1808">I think that is very gratifying.</sentence><sentence id="1809">I think that is -- that trip that I just took will definitely be very well remembered.</sentence><sentence id="1810">But I hope that for many, many years that everybody should know about it.</sentence><sentence id="1811">That is my input, to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1812">Because I am not -- I am hurting myself.</sentence><sentence id="1813">But I am not that selfish.</sentence><sentence id="1814">Somebody said to me, "Did you go to see Shindler's List?"</sentence><sentence id="1815">I said, "Of course.</sentence><sentence id="1816">Why not?" "</sentence><sentence id="1817">How could you do that?</sentence><sentence id="1818">How can you go and see it?"</sentence><sentence id="1819">I said, "Did you?"</sentence><sentence id="1820">She says, "Not yet, because I don't like to see sad things."</sentence><sentence id="1821">I said, "How can you be so selfish.</sentence><sentence id="1822">It isn't that sad, to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="1823">And how can you ignore something of history?</sentence><sentence id="1824">The world should know and you don't want to see it?"</sentence><sentence id="1825">And they went.</sentence><sentence id="1826">And they all went.</sentence></p></dialogue>
