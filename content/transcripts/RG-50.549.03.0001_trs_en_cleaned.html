<body><dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: Well, I of course am -- am new at the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, but in the days of the Cold War, basically since the second World War, initially there were very, very few cases coming, and that was because of the Cold War.</sentence><sentence id="3">And I think governments had the sense that this would be an ideologically divided <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, and that justice would not really be done properly.</sentence><sentence id="4">Once the Cold War ended, cases started to come, and also I should tell you from what I've heard that the atmosphere on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> is very different than it was at the height of the Cold War.</sentence><sentence id="5">I-It's a much easier, much more judicial type of -- of environment than it must have been, I -- I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: When were you appointed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: I was elected by the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> on March second of 2000.</sentence><sentence id="13">And it's interesting, the -- it's an election both by the security council and the general assembly.</sentence><sentence id="14">By both <span class="NPIP">bodies</span>, voting separately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="18">Q: And now you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span>, or in [indecipherable] for good?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: Well, until my -- my term is up and -- but it seemed to u -- to my wife and me important that we be here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> while the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> -- and -- and there is so much business now that one really couldn't afford to be living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and be sitting on this <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">It's basic -- it is a permanent <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">And life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> is -- it's new for us, but very exciting.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="26">Interview with Thomas Buergenthal , February 27, 2001</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What -- do you consider this -- this new work, or this job as sort of a crowning continuation of your very distinguished career in international law, and international human rights, or is it also -- or is it a difference -- somewhat different direction?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: In many ways it's -- it's a different direction.</sentence><sentence id="29">I've -- as you know, I -- I was a judge on the inter-American court of human rights.</sentence><sentence id="30">I've also sat on the UN Human Rights Committee.</sentence><sentence id="31">And thi -- this is very much an strictly <span class="BUILDING">international court</span>, but human rights issues can arise, but a lot of other cases come as well.</sentence><sentence id="32">So, f-for an international lawyer like me, this is a <span class="BUILDING">dream court</span>, and a dream come true.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: Is it in some sense a relief not to be related so closely to very painful experiences, to -- or is it -- what do you mean when you say a <span class="NPIP">dream</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: It's a dream in the sense that I think there isn't an international lawyer who wouldn't want to be on this <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, because it is really -- i-it's like being on the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">This is the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that determines what is and what is not international law.</sentence><sentence id="42">Not that we are that im-important, but in -- in terms of those of us who believe in international law, and -- and practice international law, this is the -- the Mecca to which you look.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Have you ever imagined that you would be in this <span class="NPIP">position</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: N-Not at all.</sentence><sentence id="49">Well I -- as a matter of fact I was -- I-I visited -- I had a meeting at the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, not with the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> but in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, in November bef -- of 1999, and I had -- I didn't at that point believe that I was going to be here.</sentence><sentence id="50">I -- I think it would be totally</sentence><sentence id="52">arrogant for anybody to believe that you're going to be here.</sentence><sentence id="53">You dream about it.</sentence><sentence id="54">At my age you stop dreaming about it even, and then suddenly I -- I was named.</sentence><sentence id="55">Actually, I should tell you that the notice to me that I was going to be the nominee of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> came to me while I was -- had just done a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, my second visit.</sentence><sentence id="56">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, had just come back from it, in the evening, in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> when I received the call from the legal advisory.</sentence><sentence id="57">That was very special.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Is it strange, or is it strangely appropriate that you are now living and working in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="73">My wife and I have always said that we -- that we could live almost ev - - anyplace, but I -- I think as we get older we probably should be a little more restrictive.</sentence><sentence id="74">But -- but it's certainly a -- a -- one -- one couldn't ask for a more enjoyable environment.</sentence><sentence id="75">We miss our children, we miss our grandchildren, we have eight grandchildren and they keep coming, so that part.</sentence><sentence id="76">But life here, and the working environment is certainly wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="77">I miss my students, actually.</sentence><sentence id="78">I don't miss exams, I don't miss that part, but I miss not having classes and seminars.</sentence><sentence id="79">Because this existence here, to some extent is quite lonely.</sentence><sentence id="80">Like many other <span class="BUILDING">judicial</span> -- many other <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> have this -- judges have that same experience.</sentence><sentence id="81">You work basically by yourself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: I guess my question was also aimed a little bit at knowing your background, that you originally came from Europe and now that you live in Europe again, did you ever have the desire never to live in Europe again or is it --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: No, we -- w-we -- I've come back many a time.</sentence><sentence id="99">I didn't think that I was going to live here.</sentence><sentence id="100">I -- I once had a possibility, it looked like a possibility to -- to serve on the European court of human rights, and we debated the issue of whether we would live in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="101">But it never seemed like a difficult choice if one had -- if the -- if what one was asked to do was interesting enough, the -- the living environment didn't play that much of a role.</sentence><sentence id="102">But I must say, one couldn't really ask for a nicer <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be than here in the -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Now I would like to go back into the past, and I would like to ask you about the -- the time when you came over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, about the boat trip, what you remember.</sentence><sentence id="109">You were 17 at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Yes, it was in -- in December of 1951, that's exactly 50 years ago this year.</sentence><sentence id="113">We were on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop carriers</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberty boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">It was the SS General Greeley, I still remember the name.</sentence><sentence id="115">And I think it was a -- a 10 day trip from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, with a lot of refugees, people from all over, from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, [indecipherable] even -- I have some pictures still.</sentence><sentence id="116">And it was a very scary experience except that I knew I was coming to -- to live with my uncle, and in that sense it -- it -- and I was young, so it wasn't as scary as what it must have been for -- for a lot of other people.</sentence><sentence id="117">But also the life on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was very interested.</sentence><sentence id="118">I -- I managed to get myself a interpreter's job so I didn't have to paint and scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">And it was a lot of fun, and va -- I was writing for the -- for the news -- ship newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="120">So from that point</sentence><sentence id="122">Interview with Thomas Buergenthal " February 27, 2001 of view it was all exciting.</sentence><sentence id="123">I really had no idea what awaited me in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, whether I would stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">It was adventure at the age of 17.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Why were you supposed to -- I -- were ev -- was everybody supposed to -- to work there?</sentence><sentence id="141">Was it because you didn't have money for the fare, or wa -- just --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: It was strange, we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and people were told they had to scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">decks</span>, paint the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and do all these things.</sentence><sentence id="143">But they needed people who could annou -- make announcements in different languages and so I volunteered for that.</sentence><sentence id="144">That's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Looks like you're a survivor of [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: It -- it was -- it -- well, at least it kept me above <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>, which -- which was nicer then, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was very crowded.</sentence><sentence id="147">One thing that we were all served American food, of course, for breakfast and they had these lovely boxes of cereal, these single cereal things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="150">None of us knew what to do with that, and so after we ate breakfast, we hi -- we carry -- walked around with these boxes and thought that that was dessert.</sentence><sentence id="151">That's what I remember from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> experience.</sentence><sentence id="152">But arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, you know, the -- and we -- We S -- we Sat -- we actually arrived in the evening, so we -- we weren't unloaded, couldn't disembark until the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="153">And to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with the -- all the lights and everything, was quite -- i-in some ways exciting, in some ways it brought back memories of the past, and I -- "ve often thought about that -- that moment, and it's -- it's further and further away now, I had to reread what I had written at -- at that moment about it.</sentence><sentence id="154">But I think -- when I saw the lights, I thought of the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: You -- you did write an article for -- for a -- could you s-say that you wrote an article about a newspaper, or something?</sentence><sentence id="160">Or several people actually put together a <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span>, right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes, wh-what we did on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, we put together a newspaper in all the languages that were represented on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, and I think there must have been 37 different languages.</sentence><sentence id="162">Some had to be handwritten because there were no -- no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> in those languages.</sentence><sentence id="163">I -- I wrote it in German.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: So then you arrived, and you were picked up by family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: No, I -- I wa -- I -- I -- I was picked up by a Jewish social service organization.</sentence><sentence id="180">The -- there must have been some sort of quarantine system, because I came over on the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> -- rather, children's displaced person quota.</sentence><sentence id="181">And wi -- I -- I spend a few days in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> where we were.</sentence><sentence id="182">I don't know wh -- what the purpose was, and it was there that my uncle then came and -- and picked me up.</sentence><sentence id="183">But there were quite a number of kids who had ri -- arrived a little earlier, who were Americans already because they'd come there a few weeks before I did, and showed me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">But then my uncle came and -- and</sentence><sentence id="186">picked me up.</sentence><sentence id="187">And then I -- I lived for a year and a half in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> with my uncle, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Patterson</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: Yes, it -- it was around in the early 1970's, that I -- I was teaching -- at that point I was still teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span>, at the state university of New York, and one of the lawyers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who became a good friend of mine was -- received a political appointment to serve on the U.S. delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission.</sentence><sentence id="864">And he knew very little about international human rights, but was very interested.</sentence><sentence id="865">And so he asked me to brief him, and give him backgrounds on -- on what was happening in the <span class="DLF">human rights field</span> in the world at the time, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="866">And then after that experience that he had, he became a member of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO, which was sort of the state department's private support body for -- for UNESCO.</sentence><sentence id="867">And he involved me in the work, and he -- he is -- he became the chairman of their human rights committee, and made me a member of the -- of the committee.</sentence><sentence id="868">And than I was elected, eventually, to the -- to the U.S. national commission, and then I succeeded him as -- as chairman of the commission.</sentence><sentence id="869">In the meantime, in 1974, I was asked to chair a U.S. delegation to a UNESCO meeting.</sentence><sentence id="870">And what we were doing there basically -- this was of course at the height of the -- of</sentence><sentence id="872">Interview with Thomas Buergenthal %8 February 27, 2001 Cold War, were the -- human rights was not something -- human rights was basically used in many quarters just as a propaganda tool, one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="873">And m-my delegation, we -- we tried to -- to do it right.</sentence><sentence id="874">We -- we managed to get -- they had a draft that had been prepared, we managed to get 82 amendments adopted for it.</sentence><sentence id="875">My -- my -- my colleague at the time was a -- was a professor of child psychology who had done a lot of work on children's attitudes -- international attitudes.</sentence><sentence id="876">And we worked this -- and we lobbied, and we managed to actually get a great deal done, to everybody's surprise because I think when we were put on this delegation everybody thought this was just giving a few people a free trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, but nothing was going to come out of it.</sentence><sentence id="877">And when we came back, we suggested to the U.S. government -- because we then managed to adopt the resolution that -- that should be written up.</sentence><sentence id="878">The -- and the -- the people at the state department, in charge of UNESCO said to us, well why don't you write it up?</sentence><sentence id="879">And that produced a book on this recommendation that had been -- that had been adopted, and led to my involvement and -- on human rights issues -- anything relating to human rights at UNESCO at that point, I was involved in one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="880">Eventually, up to really 1960 -- no, let me see, "78 - "79, when I was elected to the inter-American court, and I was -- I dre -- I was part of the -- I was th -- chairing the delegation of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> that managed to adopt rules for private appeals to UNESCO for human rights violations.</sentence><sentence id="881">Again things that nobody thought we were going to be able to get through, but it was adopted.</sentence><sentence id="882">It was very exciting, it was my first experience in an international gu -- inter-</sentence><sentence id="884">4 <span class="BUILDING">governmental forum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">And that's where I began, really, to get some practical experience in international human rights as a government representative.</sentence><sentence id="886">And it was -- wa -- in sense, wonderful to be there representing the -- the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> because I could see my colleagues from the east particularly, who had to continuously check their instructions and had to adhere to their instructions and I also had the feeling that if they made a mistake they would end up being in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, whereas all that could happen to me would be that I wouldn't be put on the next delegation.</sentence><sentence id="887">But you had much more freedom to negotiate, and I thought we -- we achieved some things, and it -- in these -- this context, I learned very early in those days that you -- you c -- you shouldn't have great expectations of great achievement, but step by step, you put one brick on top of the other, a-and you get some things done.</sentence><sentence id="888">And in those days it was easier to talk about human rights education, because it was not seen by many of the dictatorial governments as being threatening.</sentence><sentence id="889">What they didn't realize is that in the long run human rights education is much more dangerous to them than some more advocacy oriented course, because if you begin to teach children about -- that they have rights, that can have an impact.</sentence><sentence id="890">And so we f -- I focused on that for -- for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="891">But that was -- I found that as a -- a fascinating experience.</sentence><sentence id="892">Then of course, at some point, the U.S. withdrew from UNESCO.</sentence><sentence id="893">I was elected to the inter-American court of human rights, and had to stop my involvement with UNESCO.</sentence><sentence id="894">I always thought it was a mistake that we left <span class="BUILDING">UNESCO</span>, the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, I mean.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A: Yes, we -- what we did, actually, when we came back from this first conference, we decided in connection with the book we had written that we should get <span class="BUILDING">American schools</span> involved in teaching about international human rights.</sentence><sentence id="936">And so what we did was we organized a number of meetings with curriculum writers for <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">grade schools</span> and we got some fundings from various foundations.</sentence><sentence id="937">And th-that proved to be quite interesting, because within a few years you could see international issues like the universal declaration [indecipherable] coming into textbooks that were used in -- in <span class="BUILDING">American high schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="938">It's now probably much more -- I've lost track, but in those days that -- that was quite unique.</sentence><sentence id="939">But we -- we did that for a number of years and got a lot of people interested in it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="949">Q: And then came --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: Because you know, I -- I think what is -- what is so often lost to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, we have as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so much to offer in this <span class="DLF">field</span>, in terms of our experience with -- with human rights, with civil rights, and -- and with the court system over the fact that these issues are litigated in <span class="BUILDING">courts</span>, that -- that they are not fought on in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">Yet, when it comes to making a contribution, on our contributing also in other parts of the world, a- and getting involved in these activities, we shy back and we -- we think that this is somehow threatening to us.</sentence><sentence id="952">On the contrary, we have an obligation to contribute what we</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: And then c -- and then came a period, late 70's until "91, I believe, that you called in the earlier interview, in some way -- quote now, in some ways one of the most in- interesting periods in your life, and that was your -- that you became a member, and eventually also president of the inter-American court of human rights.</sentence><sentence id="966">Could you say something about that particular <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, and what -- what you did was -- what your involvement was there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
