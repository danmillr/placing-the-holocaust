not able to work, they're gonna take them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and kill them.</sentence><sentence id="491">I'll never

beg somebody.</sentence><sentence id="494">And they did not take me.</sentence><sentence id="495">So I was prepared that I'm going to get killed.</sentence><sentence id="496">But after we found out, it was just a opposite way.</sentence><sentence id="497">Because they knew the American are coming, and those who they think will die anyway, why...why bother to kill them.</sentence><sentence id="498">They're going to die anyway.</sentence><sentence id="499">Those who figured they could last more than two weeks, they took them...took them out, and they killed them.</sentence><sentence id="500">That's how I survived.</sentence><sentence id="501">When I got liberated...it was a Sunday, 2 o'clock, and that time...not that time, a couple of days later, the Americans, you know, they started to take care of us.</sentence><sentence id="502">And they weigh us.</sentence><sentence id="503">I weighed 70 pound.</sentence><sentence id="504">70 pound!</sentence><sentence id="505">But it looks like God wanted I should stay alive.</sentence><sentence id="506">What happened is Sunday afternoon they put up a big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in the</sentence><sentence id="508">4 open...the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="509">And all we had to do is stand in the <span class="DLF">line</span>, and they didn't care how many times you are standing in the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="510">You finished eating, if you want to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> again, you get again hot soup.</sentence><sentence id="511">So by...one day I had a little strength and I went in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="512">It was...uh...1 don't know exactly...you had go over a <span class="DLF">bridge</span>...1 would say about a mile...a mile and a half.</sentence><sentence id="513">And I didn't do nothing.</sentence><sentence id="514">A lot of people...they went in with friend, robbed, uh...the German families, you know, what they found.</sentence><sentence id="515">Me, I was a kid.</sentence><sentence id="516">I didn't need nothing.</sentence><sentence id="517">What do I need?</sentence><sentence id="518">So what I did is I went from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to another eating.</sentence><sentence id="519">Whatever they gave me, I was eating.</sentence><sentence id="520">And about 10 o'clock I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="521">And I was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="522">I was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="523">Why?</sentence><sentence id="524">Because I lay down.</sentence><sentence id="525">I lay down and while I was laying...excuse for the expression, I vomited the whole thing out.</sentence><sentence id="526">If that would have staying in, that would finish me.</sentence><sentence id="527">So that's in general what I went through in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="528">Naturally, there's stories I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="529">And matter of fact, you ask me the story, but I can tell you...uh...you know, we have a book which it says if all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oceans</span> would be ink and all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> would be pencils, wouldn't be enough to tell the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="530">But that's the general.</sentence><sentence id="531">Then I stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> about 4 weeks until a couple of us, we got liberated...uh...three people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="532">We decided we're going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="533">We don't know what we're gonna find, whom we're gonna find.</sentence><sentence id="534">But we're going...we decided we're going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="535">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="536">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="537">We...when I say we...is a friend of mine...it just happened he died last year...and myself.</sentence><sentence id="538">We knew the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going that direction toward the <span class="DLF">border</span>, and we sit...within two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, there's a round thing which locks together, you know, between the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and we are sitting... He was sitting one one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and I was sitting on other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="539">We traveled 24 hours like that.</sentence><sentence id="540">During the night, our job was every half minute to</sentence><sentence id="542">5 watch on each other we shouldn't fall asleep because if we fell asleep, we fell down, and that's a goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="543">We came after a whole night traveling like this...we came to a <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="544">I don't know which <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="545">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="546">I don't remember it was still <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or it was already <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>....1 don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="547">I remember one thing.</sentence><sentence id="548">When it got...the light came on, it was day...daylight and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was staying in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and I said to my friend, "I'm going to wash my face a little bit so freshen up a little bit."</sentence><sentence id="549">And I didn't know there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, full of SS, by the Russians taking...they took them to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="550">And Russians, they were so violent.</sentence><sentence id="551">They didn't care SS, inmates going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know...they so...people in that...in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>...middle of washing and a Russian soldier came over.</sentence><sentence id="552">He grabbed by the neck, and he showed me I should go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="553">When I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the SS, it...my eyes blackened...what is this?</sentence><sentence id="554">I am just coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="555">And I start crying and matter of fact, I showed him that piece of paper what I got when I got liberated by Americans.</sentence><sentence id="556">And usually the Russian soldiers, you know, if they would see a paper like this they don't...they don't care.</sentence><sentence id="557">Somehow the Russian soldier, he didn't know how to read it; and he gave it to one of the SS in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, and he somehow explained to the Russian soldier that I'm just coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">And he said, "Go."</sentence><sentence id="559">It didn't took...it wouldn't take not too much that I would wind up in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> with...uh...with SS, you know, together with...with those people who killed us.</sentence><sentence id="560">Because the Russians...matter of fact, a lot of Hungarian Jews after the liberation, they took them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>...<span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">Because if they wanted 100 people, they didn't care who the 100 people is, as long as 100 people go.</sentence><sentence id="562">So after traveling...uh...nice couple of days, we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">And by that time...you see...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> was liberated in January of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="564">Because you see, the</sentence><sentence id="566">6 Russians coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, they're going to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">So it took to May and the war...the second world war ended May 8.</sentence><sentence id="568">I got liberated 2 days before the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="569">Like I mentioned before that's...that's where the <span class="REGION">area</span> where they got together, the Russians and Americans.</sentence><sentence id="570">And when I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, naturally, the first thing we did, my friend and myself, we found out there any Jews alive.</sentence><sentence id="571">Or something.</sentence><sentence id="572">Anything.</sentence><sentence id="573">So they telled...they told us, "Yes, they's a...by the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> there an organization where they're getting money from the United Jewish Appeal.</sentence><sentence id="574">And everybody who goes there and say they are just coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gets a couple of penge...--like a dollar, you know.</sentence><sentence id="575">And we can continue our destiny wherever we wanta go (cough) go and...uh...we did continue and...uh..and I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was born.</sentence><sentence id="576">I found my brother in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">He wanted to travel somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="578">With the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> as I arrived, he wanted to take the same training going further...the same direction where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going.</sentence><sentence id="579">When he saw me, naturally, he didn't take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="580">You know, the happiness was unbelievable that I'm alive.</sentence><sentence id="581">And later on, 5 months, but... got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the end of June.</sentence><sentence id="582">The communism in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> got stronger and stronger by the day.</sentence><sentence id="583">And by November of 1945, they called in my brother, questioning him.</sentence><sentence id="584">From what he see, living, he's not working.</sentence><sentence id="585">Where is he taking the money to live on?</sentence><sentence id="586">And the anti-Semitism was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="587">All we heard from the Gentiles...from neighbors where we lived together all our lives, they said to us, "How could it be...how could it be so bad?</sentence><sentence id="588">You came back more people than they took you.</sentence><sentence id="589">We came back from 35 families...we were together 105 people got deported, and we came back I think 6.</sentence><sentence id="590">And they had the nerve to say, "How could it be so bad if you came...came back more people than they took you?"</sentence><sentence id="591">So I saw there's no future, and I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and over</sentence><sentence id="593">7 there they organized transport to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="594">I didn't know that time what's in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but I know here's no good.</sentence><sentence id="595">Here's no good so I have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="596">I didn't...besides my brother I didn't find...our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was bombed from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="597">My parents never came...didn't come back and my brother.</sentence><sentence id="598">So I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="599">I stayed there 2 years.</sentence><sentence id="600">But my life was...on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, we stopped in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and I wrote a letter to my brother.</sentence><sentence id="601">I said, "Look, they're helping us.</sentence><sentence id="602">Get up.</sentence><sentence id="603">Come.</sentence><sentence id="604">I don't know what's the future, but there's no future there.</sentence><sentence id="605">Come."</sentence><sentence id="606">Matter of fact..uh..6 months later, he joined me in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="607">I forget to mention to you...it's very...also a very tricky thing what they did to Germans.</sentence><sentence id="608">When we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, they had...uh...sand...a pile...a big pile of sand.</sentence><sentence id="609">And we were...they gave us cap...round cap.</sentence><sentence id="610">In the cap, we had to take the sand, the whole pile of sand, carry...uh...like a quarter of a mile.</sentence><sentence id="611">Filled...everybody had to fill in the cap, empty it, and come back, empty it again...I mean fill it up again and carry it, and we had to make it fast because slow is no good.</sentence><sentence id="612">Fast...we had to make it fast.</sentence><sentence id="613">And next day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, they gave us post cards.</sentence><sentence id="614">And we were so naive, so...we didn't know what's what, they gave us as many post cards we wanted to write to our parents, to our brothers, to our sisters.</sentence><sentence id="615">Our parents are dead already, but they give us...they gave us post cards to write.</sentence><sentence id="616">How...this how tricky they were, you know, just to fool people.</sentence><sentence id="617">You never know what they were up to.</sentence><sentence id="618">And I stayed 2 years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and it was...maybe I didn't know how to approach, but it was very hard to get a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because there were too many applicants.</sentence><sentence id="619">Not only Jews, Gentiles....there was other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with Gentiles also.</sentence><sentence id="620">They said they're also refugees.</sentence><sentence id="621">Polish, Russians, Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="622">So after staying for 2 years, I...somebody told us there is a way somehow.</sentence><sentence id="623">The way is to go west to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and from there we can take...we can apply for a</sentence><sentence id="625">8 student visa, going, studying.</sentence><sentence id="626">So I stayed 2 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="627">Matter of fact, one of the Rabbis in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> gave me a paper that he's asking the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> to let me go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to study for a year and he's giving me a position as a assistant Rabbi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="628">And I got the student visa.</sentence><sentence id="629">Naturally, I never went back.</sentence><sentence id="630">Well, I got the visa for 1 year and after a year I didn't go back.</sentence><sentence id="631">I'm not supposed to work, but...in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because I'm a student and I loved to work.</sentence><sentence id="632">So what shall I do?</sentence><sentence id="633">I have to eat.</sentence><sentence id="634">I have to pay where I stayed for the lady.</sentence><sentence id="635">So I took up a false first name.</sentence><sentence id="636">And I took out a Social Security Card.</sentence><sentence id="637">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="638">5 minutes.</sentence><sentence id="639">Alright.</sentence><sentence id="640">Can you give us 5 minutes?</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1055">Q: That was very well done.</sentence><sentence id="1056">Can you tell me about the last few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1057">What was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1061">A: There's no word for it...to describe it.</sentence><sentence id="1062">The cruelty and what we went through, because their function...when I'm talking about their function...the SS function, was the more people to kill because every day thousands and thousands of other inmates arriving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span> because that was the <span class="REGION">area</span> where the Russians and American meet each other.</sentence><sentence id="1063">You see, we were liberated May 6.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Two days later the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="1065">So it...that's where they met, the Russians and the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1066">So their function was to kill as many people...as many people they brought in from all other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1067">But with all their technic...with all geniuses what they put in how to kill more Jews, they couldn't kill as fast as they were coming in.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And there was no food whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="1069">Even the SS were going hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1070">Even they were getting very little food.</sentence><sentence id="1071">And naturally the human nature, those people who are still have a little strength to walk and we still went to work, and because we knew those people who are gonna say I have no strength to go to work gonna get killed.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Without food.</sentence><sentence id="1073">We got in the morning a little...won't call it coffee...a little black colored water.</sentence><sentence id="1074">And people were so desperate, they were chewing coal, sucked coal, eating grass.</sentence><sentence id="1075">And I have to say it that they lost all humanity whatever you call it, and those people who died during the night and few of them they still had on their lower part some meat...some meat, when we got up in the morning, we saw</sentence><sentence id="1077">1 those people dead.</sentence><sentence id="1078">But the way they were carrying them, we saw that pieces of the body were missing.</sentence><sentence id="1079">And during the morning or after work, they made somehow a little fire, and they put it on like they say in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, they barbecued and they ate it.</sentence><sentence id="1080">| am very fortunate to say I never touched it.</sentence><sentence id="1081">But there was a lot of them eating it.</sentence><sentence id="1082">And it was...it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1083">We got liberated May 6 in 1945 which came out a Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Saturday, they hanged 12 people in middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallows</span>, and all those people who stayed who can still walk had to go march in front of them to see how they were hanging from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1085">Another thing...very interesting thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Looked likes there was some...couple...not some, but a couple Germans who still couldn't take it what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="1087">What happened is we got liberated Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="1088">Friday evening before we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, there was a message from the Mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1089">And the message was that we gonna go tomorrow morning...that means Saturday morning...from appell...appell it's called, you know, where you have to stand in the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1090">And the SS gonna tell us that the Russians are very close and in order to get saved, we shouldn't get hurt, we all should go in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1091">And the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> was prepared...the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, you know, after you go in to bomb the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and we all gonna die there.</sentence><sentence id="1092">So the Mayor sent a message that he don't know if it's gonna help or not, but when we gonna stand in appell Saturday morning and we gonna hear that speech, we should all start yelling with one voice, "We don't care if we gonna go....if we gonna get killed, we're not gonna go nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="1093">We're staying here."</sentence><sentence id="1094">And it looks like they have got the strength...they didn't have the strength or the willingness to force us anymore because they know it's | day or 2 days left and we didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="1095">And that was fortunate who had still...uh...had to stand, stayed alive.</sentence><sentence id="1096">But it was prepared to lull, and that was the easiest way to kill us, to go in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and...uh...bomb</sentence><sentence id="1098">2 the...uh...<span class="DLF">gate</span>, you know, so all the stones would fell down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and we couldn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="1099">That's all.</sentence><sentence id="1100">And they...maybe they would never find us.</sentence><sentence id="1101">That we are there.</sentence><sentence id="1102">I don't know how many thousands people buried alive.</sentence><sentence id="1103">But somehow the Mayor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.78781" long="13.757868">Ebensee</span> sent us a message Friday evening that we shouldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="1104">So that's the story of my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
