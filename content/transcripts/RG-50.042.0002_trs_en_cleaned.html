<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: Let's start with start with you telling me what it was like to hear that the war had begun, and how everyday life changed, wearing the yellow star, all the things that changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: Well, uh, you know that, that the war started in 1939, and I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> minding my own business, and, uh, I just came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> from a wonderful trip, uh to, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with other students, and when we arrived back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> "39, beginning of September, uh there was a Zionist Congress in, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, and the people took time out in the <span class="DLF">beaches</span>, and we were all out in the <span class="DLF">beach</span> with my friends, and suddenly the microphone blared that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was overrun by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="19">Well, you could have dropped a needle right there in the...<span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">People, half-naked bodies, they ran everywhere to, to call <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see what was happening, and this was my first inclination that there was really a war going on.</sentence><sentence id="21">I wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, but we have very good friends, and they talked me into it, to go back.</sentence><sentence id="22">In the beginning of 1941, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because my friends said that the allies were not allowed to go on and on, and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> will not be in the war.</sentence><sentence id="23">And when I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, it was fairly quiet.</sentence><sentence id="24">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Aerocross</span>, what is the Hungarian Nazi party did not really take over completely in "41 yet.</sentence><sentence id="25">And, the only thing, there were even American ------ -------- all over, and I was teaching English to the young lady who today is Congressman Lantesher's wife, and she looked like Shirley Temple, and we used to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with our hats up and talking English.</sentence><sentence id="26">Was still allowed to speak English on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, but then suddenly we got deeply in trouble in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, those who could get run away, and they told us the stories.</sentence><sentence id="27">We didn't believe.</sentence><sentence id="28">Not the Jews and not the Christians, who were anti Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="29">We just didn't believe that it humanly possible that they do that.</sentence><sentence id="30">We were listening to the BBC now on the end of, oh let's see, in the middle of "43 suddenly everything changed.</sentence><sentence id="31">Then, the Hungarian Nazi party took over, and suddenly they reminded us that we should</sentence><sentence id="33">put on the star.</sentence><sentence id="34">My father has been taken from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and took in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, but in a couple of weeks, they let him come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">We were not moved out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">And then they started to forbid to talk English, and therefore, Annette or Agi was her name too, we went down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and we spoke English because we had a hootsper(ph) or whatever, but nobody ever stopped us on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because we didn't really look like two Jewish kids, and we did not wear the star.</sentence><sentence id="37">But we didn't go out too much, and then the BBC was not allowed to be listened to it anymore, but of course we did because that was the only was to find out what's going on during the war, and I was lucky enough to have a huge big radio my parents bought me for my 21st birthday, where we could have the whole world.</sentence><sentence id="38">So whatever news it came in was through our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I could get short wave stations, and it was very exciting to hear what's going on, and very heartbrea--we begin to believe that it can happen to us any moment.</sentence><sentence id="39">And then it did happen in 44 March, when in walked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eichmann</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">And immediately he killed almost 600,000 people in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, however, they only went by list of people, whom they should pick up.</sentence><sentence id="42">We were still not being picked up.</sentence><sentence id="43">And life begin to be more and more difficult because we didn't dare to go out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> if it possible, only to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, and eh, you didn't know what's happening next morning.</sentence><sentence id="44">And that was your question, what happened day before.</sentence><sentence id="45">So that was the life, just about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Were you afraid?</sentence><sentence id="77">What kinds of things did you witness?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: Well, I first witnessed, and that was a horror for me, the, the Hungarian Aerocross wore green shirts, as you know each of them had they own shirts.</sentence><sentence id="81">The uh Germans, they wore the brown shirts, the Fascists, uh, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> wore the black shirts, and our Hungarians guys wore the yellow, uh, the uh, green ones.</sentence><sentence id="82">And, uh, I went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> one day and I saw a priest coming out of a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and he had a green shirt on, and a Nazi, uh, sign upon him, a Hungarian Nazi, and there was a little boy of 3, and he killed the child.</sentence><sentence id="83">That was the first time the religion went out of me.</sentence><sentence id="84">No more religion, thank you.</sentence><sentence id="85">Ifa priest can do that, then, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="86">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I cried and I cried.</sentence><sentence id="87">And then this is something what we never can figure out--I worked in a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">I don't know how many of you went there, of course these <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> are not there anymore--it was the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Ritz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">And as I spoke a lot of languages, I, I had been working there, and it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="90">And, uh, one Sunday morning, or a few days before I got this letter from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> to come and visit them, and I, uh, had no time right then, it wasn't so very</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="94">important.</sentence><sentence id="95">But, it was a Sunday morning when a very excited neighbor ran into us, and he said, "Oh, just, I heard on BBC that Adam Horty is going to give up being with the Germans, and he is going to be with the allies."</sentence><sentence id="96">And my father was all excited, he was running for the champagne, and me, spoke up, I says, "Papa, don't believe what you hear.</sentence><sentence id="97">Don't drink the champagne." "</sentence><sentence id="98">Oh, you young people, you don't know what you talking about."</sentence><sentence id="99">And he brought the champagne, and we were just about drinking when Horty came on television, on uh radio, and he said very beautifully, that "I now tell you that we are with the allied forces, and not with the Nazis army anymore."</sentence><sentence id="100">And that moment, the German horse whistle came over the radio, and we didn't hear Horty's voice; I dropped my glass and I ran out because I knew I had to go to work to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">And it was a gorgeous beautiful March day, it was sunshine, very cold, and I come out and it was blackened by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">And I thought they were Americans or British or Russians, and I was running all the way to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and when I get there, the porter said to me, "Mr. Merrinch wants to see you at once, and that was the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">He was a gentle man, huge big gentleman about 250 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="104">He spoke 12 languages.</sentence><sentence id="105">He was Yugoslavian, and he was the manager.</sentence><sentence id="106">And he took me in his arm, and he said to me in French, "Child, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">These are not British or Americans.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">These are the Germans, and Horty was already arrested.</sentence><sentence id="109">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I don't want them to take you from here."</sentence><sentence id="110">So, I run back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and father, all he could say is, "You were right."</sentence><sentence id="111">Now I decided I'm going to the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">And, uh, there was difficulty to go up there because uh, everybody was afraid to go to <span class="BUILDING">foreign embassy</span>, but my cousin had a very wonderful boyfriend, who was a Christian, who had a big black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes Benz</span>, and he said, "I'll take you up."</sentence><sentence id="113">And he arrived in a Nazi Uniform.</sentence><sentence id="114">He had a Nazi flag on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">He pushed me in there, and took me up to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">And, uh the ambassador was quite surprised when he looked up and saw the Nazi flag, and I explained to him what happened.</sentence><sentence id="117">And, then he explained to me the absolutely out of world thing, that I have a fiance in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">Well, that's a long story, yes, I had a very dear friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> with whom I corresponded for 12 years, and he explained to me that this young man went to the king and to the foreign minister and said that this woman would be my wife already, but the war came, and therefore she should be Swedish.</sentence><sentence id="119">And they handed me a Swedish passport.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="120">And I looked, and I said, "A what?"</sentence><sentence id="121">So, I became a Swedish citizen, and you can see on those, I have that passport here, it says there, Emergency Passport.</sentence><sentence id="122">They also gave these to Swedish people if they didn't have the hard cover passport, hard cover paper.</sentence><sentence id="123">And, then, the ambassador explained that he would like to keep me at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">And I said, "Yes, but I have my parents <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="125">And</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="129">he said, "We will send somebody down to your parents, and tell them what happened and why, but we are responsible for you."</sentence><sentence id="130">So, I have been the guest of the Swedish government for 3 or, glorious weeks, except my heart <span class="NPIP">inside</span> was hurting, what can happen to my parents?</sentence><sentence id="131">And I found out while I was up there that I wasn't the only one who was</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: We have to change rolls.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="133">beep</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: Can you explain to me about the edict to separate mixed couples, Christians and Jews who were married?</sentence><sentence id="135">Just tell me about that, because people can't believe such a thing could happen, and then explain what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: I will explain to you because I had an uncle who was a Unitarian, and an aunt who was a Jew, and they had a wonderful marriage, and suddenly the radio uh declared that all married couples, or mixed marriages, either divorce immediately, or both of them will be killed.</sentence><sentence id="137">And, my many, many people there were found dead together.</sentence><sentence id="138">They cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and then they went into a clean <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, and then they found them...suicidal by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="139">My uncle and aunt called too and they said, "We want to die because we will not separate."</sentence><sentence id="140">And I screamed at them, and I said, "You can't do that!"</sentence><sentence id="141">By that time we already had Raoul, and I said, "I get you papers."</sentence><sentence id="142">And I did.</sentence><sentence id="143">And they got themselves false papers too, and thanks God they lived through the war.</sentence><sentence id="144">But it was thousands of people who killed themselves, so it was a very easy people to kill...a easy time to kill people, because most of them would not divorce.</sentence><sentence id="145">One of them, Willa Kodai (ph), you know, the famous Hungarian musician, whose wife was a Jew, and he said, "I would never, never leave my wife."</sentence><sentence id="146">And they didn't touch him, and they didn't touch his wife either.</sentence><sentence id="147">But very few of them, thousands and thousands, they died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: What about converting?</sentence><sentence id="161">Could you convert from Judaism to Christianity?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="165">Now, on the other day there was a phone call there that anyone who is not into Jewish religion will be saved.</sentence><sentence id="166">Now, of course, we wanted to believe anything.</sentence><sentence id="167">And, again, I was a very</sentence><sentence id="169">lucky girl because I grew up as an only Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>'s best <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">And our principal at that time, and later on, he became the Bishop of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, the Protestant Bishop.</sentence><sentence id="171">He was also my best friend because he had 7 daughters, and I was always in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">And he arrived to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, what was then still the <span class="BUILDING">Christian house</span>, and he said to my father, who was the same age, "Uncle, I want to baptize your child, because she is my 7th daughter."</sentence><sentence id="173">Of course, Papa couldn't say no.</sentence><sentence id="174">We went down to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and my father cried very loud, and he kept on saying, "Papa, don't cry.</sentence><sentence id="175">I have a lot of Jews down there whom I saved, and if the Nazis find out..." And he christened me because he believed that it will help me.</sentence><sentence id="176">Possibly the miracle helped, but thousands and thousands of people died because nobody cared.</sentence><sentence id="177">That every other <span class="BUILDING">religion</span>--that was just another off day, funny saying.</sentence><sentence id="178">Many time, of course, many people survived with false papers, who, who didn't look really Jewish, so uh, but it was also just a, a lie like everything else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Explain to me more about those lies.</sentence><sentence id="196">How did they fool people at the beginning, and keep it so you didn't believe what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Well, you see because every day there was something new in, in in the radio, and also, the threatening, if you go out, we kill you, if you do this, we kill you.</sentence><sentence id="200">And also, very quickly, the bombing started, and that made them extremely angry, that the Americans started to bomb us, and the American and British bomb that went all the way down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">The Russian bombs, they only took the last 2 floors up on the top.</sentence><sentence id="202">And, so much so that while I was at the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span>, my friend who brought me up and he came one day, and he said to the ambassador that I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, otherwise they going to kill my parents, in the meantime, because of the Hungarian Nazis" anger--what they did they made every second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span>, with a huge big Mogendovid on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because their idea was that the Americans will not bomb the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span>, and therefore, or then the Christians will be saved.</sentence><sentence id="203">Of course, they were wrong because they bombed the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span>, they bombed the <span class="BUILDING">Christian houses</span>, but they found the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, and they bombed that too.</sentence><sentence id="204">And my parents had to move out from our <span class="BUILDING">apt</span> and they moved in--thanks God my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> wasn't too far--her apt--and they moved, and the Nazis came every morning and they were reading names, and my name was still on.</sentence><sentence id="205">So they argued for a while, and I told the ambassador that it is my job to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my parents because they might kill the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="206">So they wouldn't allow me to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with him.</sentence><sentence id="207">I had to go</sentence></p><p><sentence id="210">down in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> with one of the diplomats who was sitting quite away from me because he wanted to see where I'm going, with the promise that whenever they allow us out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, because we were allowed every day 2 hours to go out and <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> with the star on, and you were lucky if you came back from shopping without being killed.</sentence><sentence id="211">And, if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> still worked, would I please call up.</sentence><sentence id="212">And, I was hardly down there for 2 wks when I called, and I was told to come back at once because there is something new happening.</sentence><sentence id="213">So, I had to go down on my knees to my friend, to take me up once more, promising that I will not stay.</sentence><sentence id="214">And there was Raoul Wallenberg, and uh, he introduced himself, I didn't really know who he was, ad uh, he asked me in English, that time, "Would you like to work with me?"</sentence><sentence id="215">And I showed him my star, and he started to laugh and Paranga was laughing, he says, "That's nothing!</sentence><sentence id="216">That's getting off."</sentence><sentence id="217">I said, "Yeah?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="218">How?" (</sentence><sentence id="219">Laughs) So, they told me how they gave me, him, they must have bribed the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian police station</span> because I had to go down all by myself.</sentence><sentence id="220">I didn't find out only later on that actually they were around in case I'm not coming out, so they can pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="221">And I went out to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, and police chief, whose name I can't remember, he took me in his arm, and he cried.</sentence><sentence id="222">He was a very good actor, and he said, " I'm so proud I'm the one who cuts the star off, and he didn't cut it off."</sentence><sentence id="223">And he said, "Remember my name come.</sentence><sentence id="224">Or the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="225">How good I was."</sentence><sentence id="226">He must have gotten quite a lot of money, and as I walked out I heard I somebody say, "Here goes another bloody Jew, and I thought, "Hah, now they're going to kill me."</sentence><sentence id="227">But they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="228">I made it all the way back.</sentence><sentence id="229">So, now Raoul Wallenberg hands me another paper, he said, "Get down to the house commission."</sentence><sentence id="230">By now, it was incredible, we had a housing commission because as soon as somebody got out of their beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, somebody moved in.</sentence><sentence id="231">And he said, get your <span class="BUILDING">apt</span> back.</sentence><sentence id="232">I said, "Really?"</sentence><sentence id="233">He said, "Yes, really."</sentence><sentence id="234">So by that time, I was all Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="235">I felt, if he's that strong and has not to do it, I can do it.</sentence><sentence id="236">And I was rather pretty girl, so I took up the best suit I had, and I walked with my paper in my hand, but inside of course, I was twisting, and I sort of threw it to the head of the man, and he gave me a dirty look, but without a word, he gave it back, he said, "Here."</sentence><sentence id="237">I walked out and I said, "Why?</sentence><sentence id="238">How come they just give it to me."</sentence><sentence id="239">Well, I forgot that it was actually in my father's name, so I walked back to our super, who uh, was living on us like a leach for years and years and years, and his wife was delighted to see me alive, but not him.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="240">And I said, I came to get my <span class="BUILDING">apt</span> back, whereby she said, "Oh my daughter already has..." no, he said, uh, "My daughter is going to have your <span class="BUILDING">apt</span>."</sentence><sentence id="241">So, the wife spoke up, said, "Our daughter already has an <span class="BUILDING">apt</span>."</sentence><sentence id="242">So, I existed, sort of, and he said, well, he can't give it to me, I have to go to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="246">the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>'s lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="247">I said fine.</sentence><sentence id="248">I walked all the way to the lawyer, and there was the same thing as with the policeman.</sentence><sentence id="249">Oh, I give it to you of course, but you must remember my name when they coming to tell how much good I did.</sentence><sentence id="250">I said sure, and I had ---------, I said, "Of course I will.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="251">Naturally."</sentence><sentence id="252">So, then I walked back to the super, who was very surprised, and I got the signature, and we went upstairs, and funnily enough, "The <span class="BUILDING">apt</span> was completely empty.</sentence><sentence id="253">Only one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span>, and that was closed, and when he opened it, I was terribly surprised to find all our paintings, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, everything was in there.</sentence><sentence id="254">So first I thought to myself, "Gee, he isn't such a bad man," until he opened his mouth, and he said, "I get even with you, yet."</sentence><sentence id="255">But at least, right now, I had it.</sentence><sentence id="256">So, I did the terrible thing--my parents didn't have any papers yet, but I walked back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I said, "Out!"</sentence><sentence id="257">And my father said, "But, how?"</sentence><sentence id="258">I said "Just get out.</sentence><sentence id="259">I have already shutzpasses from, for you from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">Just get out."</sentence><sentence id="261">And I brought them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="262">And, um, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="263">And then, what I did with Raoul, every day I had to go up there, and I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> because they were over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span>, and for a while I was hostessing, you know, I was with thousands and thousands of Jewish people, and, and eh, until Nazi, um, people came up to us for these paper...because when Raoul arrived and he asked what, what the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> has done, they said, "We have given out 80 passports."</sentence><sentence id="264">And he said, "Eighty passports???</sentence><sentence id="265">When there are eh, 280,000 people to be saved?</sentence><sentence id="266">That's nothing.</sentence><sentence id="267">And that's when he designed this beautiful <span class="DLF">shutzpass</span>, what means protective pass, and people still keep on saying passports, there were no passports.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="268">SR-2, WFI, HOLOCAUST, ----------, CR 3 IS UP.</sentence><sentence id="269">2/11/92.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Okay, the background was that uh, uh, I was just about, uh, graduating from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, and,</sentence><sentence id="278">um, I got scarlet fever, so I never really graduated, they just gave me the paper.</sentence><sentence id="279">And I was supposed to go a German island at that time to very dear friends, who were Jewish, and uh, it didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="280">But, then, 1936 Olympic Games came, and that was about the last time that the Jews were allowed to be around, and they me invited me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> instead.</sentence><sentence id="281">So, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and I had a wonderful time--I, I watched Jesse Owens winning the Gold Medal for his flying instead of running and I thought he was wonderful because he was hated as much as we are because he was black.</sentence><sentence id="282">And, uh, it was wonderful, and then, in the days, what we took there, we went out to swim, and I met a lot of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> also, and one of them was, uh, a young man, who exchanged cards, and my name was Mandel, and then years go by and there is the war, and the Nazis are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and suddenly the ------------- in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I look out and I see a uniformed man, and my parents were, I mean, shaking.</sentence><sentence id="283">And I said, "But, Mommy, this is the boy from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>."</sentence><sentence id="284">And I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, but didn't let him in.</sentence><sentence id="285">And he said, "Agi, you remember me!"</sentence><sentence id="286">And, I said, "Yes, of course Iremember you."</sentence><sentence id="287">That was already, we were back in our <span class="BUILDING">Christian house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">And he said, "Would you show me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="289">And, I said, "Sure, I'd be glad to.</sentence><sentence id="290">Goodbye Mommy and Daddy," and out I went.</sentence><sentence id="291">I couldn't say I'm not going with you.</sentence><sentence id="292">Everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looked at me, and they didn't know whether I was taken or walking.</sentence><sentence id="293">And we walked around until we came to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and this young man stopped there, and he said, "Do you see this <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>."</sentence><sentence id="294">I said, "Yeah, sure."</sentence><sentence id="295">He said, "That's where I'm going to kill every single Jew."</sentence><sentence id="296">So my stomach went all the way down.</sentence><sentence id="297">What am I going to do now?</sentence><sentence id="298">If!</sentence><sentence id="299">tell him I am one, he will kill me right on the spot, and I can't afford it.</sentence><sentence id="300">And I turned to him and I said, "Did you ever know a Jew?"</sentence><sentence id="301">And he said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="302">I said, "Well, did any ever hurt you?"</sentence><sentence id="303">He says, "No!"</sentence><sentence id="304">I said, "Then why do want to kill them?"</sentence><sentence id="305">He says, "Hitler told me."</sentence><sentence id="306">So now I had to think very fast, and I looked at my watch, I said, "Oh, you have to forgive me, but I, I'm teaching English, and I have to run to a lesson.</sentence><sentence id="307">It was wonderful seeing you.</sentence><sentence id="308">And I run away.</sentence><sentence id="309">I never see him again.</sentence><sentence id="310">But, it was a frightening couple of hours.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: And now I want you to tell me about Raoul Wallenberg and, I've never heard of him, I don't know who he is.</sentence><sentence id="349">So, tell me very generally, if you had to tell me briefly who he is, and what he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="353">Raoul Wallenberg is, was then, a young 32-year-old man from a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="354">He was</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="358">an architect, everybody says he was the ambassador, he was a diplomat, he was not.</sentence><sentence id="359">He got his education here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ann Arbor</span>, <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>, he became a top architect, and his uncle, his grandfather, Wallenberg grandfather was a diplomat, he was an ambassador to, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> and later on to, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>, and he was the one who really brought Raoul up because his father died 3 mos.</sentence><sentence id="360">before he was born.</sentence><sentence id="361">And this little boy was surrounded by love, and he grew up with always caring about other people.</sentence><sentence id="362">And, uh, his grandfather saw to it that he learned all the European languages, and that he is a well-educated young man.</sentence><sentence id="363">And, he was funny, he was wonderful, he was a great actor, he usually imitated everybody, and, uh, he was just great, and when he came back from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, it was way in the 30s,and Hitler was already around, and he couldn't find anybody who wanted to build, so architect he couldn't be.</sentence><sentence id="364">So they sent him first to <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">His grandfather wanted him to learn the business of the Wallenberg's what was banking mostly.</sentence><sentence id="366">And when he got to <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span>, very shortly he wrote to his grandfather, why aren't you doing something?</sentence><sentence id="367">They are killing the blacks here.</sentence><sentence id="368">They shouldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="369">Those are wonderful people.</sentence><sentence id="370">And he was very disturbed and he was wanting to come back.</sentence><sentence id="371">Then, his grandfather sent him to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, what was no <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> yet, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span>, and that's where he met first, these people who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, those who could run away, and they told him the horror stories.</sentence><sentence id="372">So, again he asked his grandfather to come back because he has to do something for humanities.</sentence><sentence id="373">So he cam back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, and of course, he couldn't do a thing for anyone, but he became a partner of a Hungarian Jew who couldn't travel anymore, who had a big import, export-import business in uh, food.</sentence><sentence id="374">And, uh, Raoul became his partner because he could travel around still, and every time he came back, he said to his partner, ".-----, they're going to kill everybody.</sentence><sentence id="375">You can't imagine what they do in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="376">And what they do in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">Let me go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and bring your family out."</sentence><sentence id="378">And this Hungarian was laughing.</sentence><sentence id="379">He says, "Raoul, whom do you think you are?</sentence><sentence id="380">Jesus Christ or Moses?</sentence><sentence id="381">You can do nothing."</sentence><sentence id="382">In the meantime, finally, somebody went to Roosevelt, our president, and told him <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was the last <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where there was ------ Jewish population, and it looks like that the Germans are going in there to kill everyone.</sentence><sentence id="383">Would he please help.</sentence><sentence id="384">So the Hunga--uh, The American Refugee Board has been erected, and the gentlemen by the name of Olsen has been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to find a person who would go with a mission to save people in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">The Hun--, uh, the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> was in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with Kalman Lauer(ph), the firm where Raoul worked, they figured they go to Hungarian Jew, maybe he knows someone.</sentence><sentence id="386">And when they told him what they want, he started to laugh, he said, "Yes, I have a young partner, and he</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="390">can talk of nothing else but saving the world."</sentence><sentence id="391">So I don't want to go in with you how many interviews he had, and probably because of these interviews it is that he is now 46 years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="392"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> was a real spy center.</sentence><sentence id="393">there was a big <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> there, where there were Russian spies, German spies, you name it.</sentence><sentence id="394">And Raoul had a lot of meetings there with this Mr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="395"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olson</span>.</sentence><sentence id="396">What turned out later on that he was man of the OSS, what was before the CIA.</sentence><sentence id="397">But Raoul had absolutely no idea, he just knew that he was an American.</sentence><sentence id="398">And talking to Raoul, and seeing how excited he was and what he wanted, they gave him the job to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="399">He was 32 year old.</sentence><sentence id="400">His demand was, of course, that he needed a diplomatic passport because without that he couldn't travel.</sentence><sentence id="401">That's how he became the third secretary or fourth secretary of the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">He also demanded unlimited money, and when they asked him why, he said because I'm sure I will have to bribe the Germans and the Hungarians to save some people, and they said yes.</sentence><sentence id="403">And then the third one was that he wanted free-hand to do whatever he wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">Well, of course when he arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> on July 9, 1944, uh, they didn't look at him very happily, the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, because there is someone who was never a diplomat, and he wants to take over.</sentence><sentence id="405">But it turned out that that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="406">Raoul was the one who went to talk to people.</sentence><sentence id="407">Raoul was the one who saved the people.</sentence><sentence id="408">So now you know who <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> is or was.</sentence><sentence id="409">A great wonderful human being, whose only idea was to help the innocent.</sentence><sentence id="410">And for this, they took him.</sentence><sentence id="411">And for many other reasons.</sentence><sentence id="412">but the way he saved the people was so incredible, and I can only talk for myself because I have not met anyone except the photographer, Thomas Welch, who has the same feeling that Raoul gave us such an enormous strength to do the same thing unafraid.</sentence><sentence id="413">Of course, we don't know either, whether he inside himself being afraid, and we too, maybe our stomachs sometimes didn't work the same way.</sentence><sentence id="414">But we just said no, we can do it.</sentence><sentence id="415">And we did the most incredible things because Raoul wanted us to do.</sentence><sentence id="416">And that was the beauty and he never thought of being afraid.</sentence><sentence id="417">He went out to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when the Germans took the people to already to take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and his pockets were full of all kind of papers, not just real shutzpassses but drivers license and this and that because the Germans couldn't read.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="418">And before he even shouted, he first gave the Hungarian man some drinks because they love cognac and all that, and made them good and drunk and asked them to help him, and he was shouting there, "Come out!</sentence><sentence id="419">Come out!</sentence><sentence id="420">All the people who have my papers!"</sentence><sentence id="421">And of course people suddenly realize that there is some angel who wants to help them, and he just handed them papers out, and before the Germans could really start shooting, he had hundred people on</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="425">our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, ----- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to bring them <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="426">And then Raoul looked back, another hundred people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="427">But you can't just save everyone.</sentence><sentence id="428">And then another day when uh, when, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> this year it was very early snowing in November and there were even in September already there were enormously cold coldest winter in 40 years, and they were marching people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="429">Even today, in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, it's five hours.</sentence><sentence id="430">You can imagine what it was walking old people and children.</sentence><sentence id="431">And he would scream--I had a girlfriend there who was there with mother...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="432">SR-3 beep</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="433">Q: Why don't you just continue and tell me some of the main things--incidents--that Raoul did.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: Well, this one I'm just shortening it down for you that again he went and he had a big black book, and this time he went with Paranger, and another couple even Swiss people and of course the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross trucks</span>, and he would shout at the German in German, that, "I am a diplomat, and I will be sure that I will not help you people.</sentence><sentence id="435">If you don't let this out, all my protected people anybody with my papers turn around.</sentence><sentence id="436">My girlfriend with her mother and sister, we can be killed anyway, and they turned around.</sentence><sentence id="437">They had no papers, and Raoul just gave them something, and they went on, and they, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="438">And then he was started reading out names out of this black book, and of course everybody caught on and they just came, and on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, Paranga says to him, "Raoul, I didn't know we had a book with all the names, and he started hysterically laughing, and he says "You didn't know?"</sentence><sentence id="439">And he opens the book and not a single word in it.</sentence><sentence id="440">But that how he was.</sentence><sentence id="441">Then, we already had <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">We had 2 <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> what eventually was used by everyone because it was right in the middle and if somebody was hurt from a bomb, they brought them in.</sentence><sentence id="443">But, Raoul was marvelous in learning names.</sentence><sentence id="444">And what he did first and he never forgot a name--he learned all the main uh Hungarian Aerocross officers names and where they were sitting in which <span class="BUILDING">office</span> because they were all over.</sentence><sentence id="445">And one of the officers were right near our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he arrives to our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> one day unshaven and hungry, and I was there delivering meals to some patients I remember, and uh, he came in and there are these 3 little punks 13, 14 year old with a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="449">gun.</sentence><sentence id="450">The doctor with his hands up, and the patient sitting, and Raoul couldn't speak Hungarian, but boy he could hit, and with all his might, and half German, half Hungarian, he hit these guys, and of course, the guns fell down, and he says, "Get out of here!</sentence><sentence id="451">And bring me your officer!"</sentence><sentence id="452">Three minutes pass.</sentence><sentence id="453">The boys left because they got such a hit, I think one of them even had a bloody nose, but Raoul didn't care, and he pushed away the guns.</sentence><sentence id="454">In walks an officer, and Raoul looks at him, he says, "Simon, what took you 3 minutes to get here, and the man was so surprised.</sentence><sentence id="455">He said, "How do you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?"</sentence><sentence id="456">He knew that he was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="457">He said, "I know everybody's name, and I don't understand why you don't bring me medication when that's what I was asking for.</sentence><sentence id="458">And, uh, I thnk you better go because I understand that you killed a German Gestapo officer by mistake and the guy said, "No, I didn't."</sentence><sentence id="459">He said, "Oh, yes you did.</sentence><sentence id="460">Because he died right here in our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but before he died, he sent your name up to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, and they're looking for you."</sentence><sentence id="461">Without a word, Simon disappeared, and they all, you know, relax, and the doctor said, "Raoul, what did you just do?"</sentence><sentence id="462">And Raoul starts laughing.</sentence><sentence id="463">He said, "I did nothing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="464">I knew it was Simon who was the officer, and we were lucky because it was Simon.</sentence><sentence id="465">So the doctor said, "Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here."</sentence><sentence id="466">Raoul sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and started laughing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="467">He says, "Of Course not.</sentence><sentence id="468">But he killed so many people, one of them could have been an officer.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="469">You see, this was his mind.</sentence><sentence id="470">He was in danger, they could have killed him.</sentence><sentence id="471">Simon could have killed him.</sentence><sentence id="472">But no, he had to try with a big lie, to help, and he did.</sentence><sentence id="473">And, and he was absolutely unafraid.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="474">We heard it in the tele, in the radio, uh, that uh, all young girls in the age of 18 and 25 have to go to such and such a <span class="BUILDING">sports palace</span>, and clean up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> after the bombing.</sentence><sentence id="475">Well, we knew exactly where they going to go, and Raoul turned to us, he says, "Let's get the pictures because all of you must have young sisters and aunts and so forth, and let's write the passes.</sentence><sentence id="476">And that time, because we had to move all the time, because Eichmann was after all of us, especially after Raoul, Raoul slept somewhere else every night.</sentence><sentence id="477">And this time we were over in the Buda side in a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>, and as it, they bombed all the time, we had only candlelight, and we had black curtains, and we were putting the pictures on and the ambassador was sitting there--Ambassador Danies--signing each of them.</sentence><sentence id="478">Around midnight Raoul arrives again unshaven, tired, but with a big smile when he came to us and said, "How are we doing?</sentence><sentence id="479">By three o clock we have to uh send out all these passes."</sentence><sentence id="480">And that time we already had curfew in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, not just for the Jews but for everyone, from 9 o clock in the evening to 7 in the morning, no one was allowed out.</sentence><sentence id="481">But I was very surprised why in a gorgeous cold icy night with, with stars out, why don't they bomb us?</sentence><sentence id="482">Maybe</sentence></p><p><sentence id="485">they knew what we heard in the radio, and they didn't want to, to bomb--no bombing.</sentence><sentence id="486">Quiet <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, beautiful, and I was the first already with 500 of my passes, but before we got ready, Raoul said, "Oh, I forgot to tell you a lovely great news, but don't look up, it's not important."</sentence><sentence id="487">We had new neighbors in the other <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">And, of course, we all looked up, and he said, "I told you, don't look up.</sentence><sentence id="489">It's only the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span>."</sentence><sentence id="490">Nobody cared.</sentence><sentence id="491">So, I had my 500 papers, and Raoul came over and put his had around me, he says, "Good luck, Kid."</sentence><sentence id="492">And I walked out.</sentence><sentence id="493">At that time, I was very young and very much in love with an Italian, and all I could think of was the war will be over, and the moon is out and, you know how young woman are, and I carried these 500 passes, and I delivered each of them, and some of them was my friend who opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, "Agi, what are you doing out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="494">I said, "Don't worry about it, there is an angel who sent you the paper.</sentence><sentence id="495">I hope it saves your life."</sentence><sentence id="496">And only when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> finally and I sat down on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> around 4 o clock and I said, "Oh my God, what did I just do?</sentence><sentence id="497">I could have been killed by the Nazis."</sentence><sentence id="498">And then, just like Raoul would think, he says, "the Nazis, they are great cowards, they wouldn't dare to be out on a night like that."</sentence><sentence id="499">And I went to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="500">At 6 0 clock in the morning, I woke up that my 2 girlfriends made it all the way back with these passes, and they came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">Then, we had, Raoul was away again, when he heard, the last day, that the Hungarian Nazi party had taken people down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="502">I don't know if you've been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> or ever, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> is uh, two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, and in the middle is the so called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Blue Danube</span>, for me it is the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Red Danube</span>, but that's what it was, and they took people down there, the Hungarian Nazis, and they roped 3 people together, and they shot the middle one, so they all fell in.</sentence><sentence id="503">And if they saw a movement, they shot again, so they'd be sure.</sentence><sentence id="504">But many people by themselves somehow got out.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="505">But it was a terribly cold winter, as I said, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> was frozen with big slabs of ice.</sentence><sentence id="506">So, Raoul came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the third night, and there was no moonlight, no stars, just cold and dark.</sentence><sentence id="507">And he turned to us the first time, usually only talked to the men and the Red Cross, "How many of you can swim?"</sentence><sentence id="508">I have a big mouth, I put up my hand, I said, "Best swimmer in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="509">He says, "Let's go."</sentence><sentence id="510">And as you saw me coming in like a teddy bear, that's how I was dressed, and a hat and a gloves, and we went down on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, the Hungarians didn't even hear us coming because they were so busy roping and shooting, and we stood on the left way over, we had doctors and nurses in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and then we had people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to pull us out.</sentence><sentence id="511">Four of us, three men and me, we jumped and thanks to the ice, the ropes hang on to it, and saved people out, but only 50, and then we were so frozen that we couldn't do it anymore.</sentence><sentence id="512">But without Raoul Wallenberg, we wouldn't</sentence></p><p><sentence id="515">have saved even one single person.</sentence><sentence id="516">And, you know, when 40 or almost 50 years going, sometimes you think, "Do I dream this?</sentence><sentence id="517">Did it really happen?"</sentence><sentence id="518">Until last year, I spoke in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, and I told them the Wallenberg story and an old gentleman got up and he said, "Young lady, hold it right there.</sentence><sentence id="519">Do you see this little <span class="DLF">hole</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="520">And I said "Yes, sir."</sentence><sentence id="521">He said, "That's where the bullet hit me, and you pulled me out."</sentence><sentence id="522">And I looked at him, I said, "No I didn't."</sentence><sentence id="523">He says, "Yes, you were the only girl because we met you after in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="524">And it was, I was shaken up terribly, but some of us, Raoul, uh Peranga had the same wonderful meeting one day when the Russians were in already, and they had the uprising, and some of the Jews escaped on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">And he was already a consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and he suddenly thought, "Well, why don't I do what Raoul did and help people out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>."</sentence><sentence id="526">And he went down just with a little flashlight, and helped people out.</sentence><sentence id="527">One lady came off and saw him and run to him and said, "Mr. Peranga, you saved me from the Nazis, now you saving me from the Russians."</sentence><sentence id="528">Well, you see, we wouldn't recognize those people, but they knew us because we were so few, but it is a wonderful feeling that because of Raoul we could done these things, and that his very last and huge, and this argument I have with many people, they say "Ah, he probably saved 5000 people."</sentence><sentence id="529">That is absolutely ridiculous because by that time we had a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and it was surrounded by the Hunga--all the proper <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> around the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and there were 70000 people in there.</sentence><sentence id="530">And the Russians were already at the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and Eichmann decided that this is the time that he should kill everyone.</sentence><sentence id="531">And he ordered to have the 70000 people killed.</sentence><sentence id="532">And how we found out is some of these Hungarian Nazis, they wanted to help Raoul because they knew that the war is over, and he was like me too--"Oh yes, I promise I help you."</sentence><sentence id="533">Okay, but they came and one of them.....Sorry.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="534">beep</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="535">Q: I want you to go back to the beginning of the 70,000 story, so I want you to start with when people speculate about how many were saved.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="536">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="537">So, uh we had this beautiful, beautiful, uh, <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> around it became the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="538">70,000 people were pushed in there.</sentence><sentence id="539">The only thing it was that uh, the Swedish government went in at least twice a week to deliver some food and medication.</sentence><sentence id="540">And, uh, this one</sentence><sentence id="542">morning, one of the Hungarian officers who already thought that Raoul will help him after, and the Soviet comes in, said, "Raoul, Eichmann just ordered to kill the 70,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">And the guns are already standing there."</sentence><sentence id="544">Raoul without batting an eye said, "Oh boy, and we have 2 of our Swedish girls in there now.</sentence><sentence id="545">They just delivered the medication.</sentence><sentence id="546">Go back to your <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and tell them the Germans have called off the...killing."</sentence><sentence id="547">And then he looked at us all waiting in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and he said, "Listen to me what I'm going to do," because he was always full of ideas, and dangerous ideas because he could have been killed.</sentence><sentence id="548">He picks up the phone and he dials the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span>, and he says, "I want to speak to General Schmitthuber in beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="549">This is Lieutenant Kraus."</sentence><sentence id="550">So who dares to tell a Lieutenant Kraus that he can't speak to the General.</sentence><sentence id="551">The General came to the phone, and Raoul introduces himself again, he says, "Raoul Wallenberg."</sentence><sentence id="552">Well, he couldn't hang up on him.</sentence><sentence id="553">And Raoul said, "I don't understand what you are doing.</sentence><sentence id="554">I understand you are a highly decorated first world war general.</sentence><sentence id="555">How can you take it on your heart to kill 70,000 innocent people, whereby he must have answered, "Eichmann ordered it."</sentence><sentence id="556">Now, Eichmann could have been standing right by the General, but Raoul had to try, and he starts laughing, and he looks at us, and do like this and that with his eye.</sentence><sentence id="557">He said, "Eichmann told you?Didn't you know that he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="558">I had lunch with him yesterday."</sentence><sentence id="559">Which was of course a lie.</sentence><sentence id="560">Whereby the man answered, "I didn't know."</sentence><sentence id="561">So Raoul said to him in not simple words that, "If you don't call off the killing immediately, I as a diplomat will be sure that you will be the first one hanged before your <span class="BUILDING">office</span>."</sentence><sentence id="562">Within 2 minutes he called off the killing, and therefore, the 70,000 people plus the 2 Swedish girls have been saved.</sentence><sentence id="563">So if he wouldn't have done anything more than that, that would have been enough, didn't it?</sentence><sentence id="564">But he did not.</sentence><sentence id="565">And, uh, that was that, and then as you know maybe before that we also had...beep.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="600">Q: All right, let's go on from there into another story.</sentence><sentence id="601">You want to do having Eichmann for dinner?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="604">A: Oh yeah, that was a wonderful thing.</sentence><sentence id="605">One day he decided he invites Eichmann to dinner, but he was so busy he completely and wholly forgot about it.</sentence><sentence id="606">So frantically, he called other diplomats, "Do you have any food?</sentence><sentence id="607">Do you have any drinks?</sentence><sentence id="608">I forgot I invited Eichmann.</sentence><sentence id="609">so they decided that they will go to another consul's place uh, uh, no he was then also third secretary Burg, and uh,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="613">Raoul has been of course as usual just with an open shirt, very relaxed and the little man Eichmann arrived with about 7 or 8 guns around him, and two men.</sentence><sentence id="614">And, uh, they had a very pleasant dinner, and they had a very pleasant uh, uh drinks there, and Raoul turned to him suddenly and he said, "Look, Eichmann, I think what you're doing is crazy.</sentence><sentence id="615">You know that the Germans lost the war."</sentence><sentence id="616">Now, we were by candlelight.</sentence><sentence id="617">Of course, they were, and he went to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and pulled up the shade, and right then they were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> like...terribly.</sentence><sentence id="618">And he says, "Look the whole beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is burning.</sentence><sentence id="619">So give up your idea of killing the Jews because you, you will be killed anyhow."</sentence><sentence id="620">And Eichmann's answer was, "I know that if they catch me I will be killed, but I took it to my head to kill everybody, and I will, but you're disturbing me."</sentence><sentence id="621">Whereby Raoul looked at him, he says, "I don't disturb you enough."</sentence><sentence id="622">And he said, "But, Mr. Wallenberg, don't forget, just a diplomatic passport doesn't really help.</sentence><sentence id="623">Diplomats are dying too."</sentence><sentence id="624">And sure enough, in a few weeks after, a big heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> rammed into Raoul's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, but thanks God Raoul wasn't in it, and Raoul picked up the phone and screamed at Eichmann, "You ruined my best <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>!"</sentence><sentence id="625">Whereby he answered, "I wanted to kill you."</sentence><sentence id="626">He said, "That's not so easy to kill me."</sentence><sentence id="627">He wasn't afraid.</sentence><sentence id="628">The only thing he was afraid, yes, it was the bombing because there he couldn't do a thing.</sentence><sentence id="629">And that, too, you know, we had two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span>, did you know that?</sentence><sentence id="630">That he had 2 <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="631">And in one of them there was 79 children, and they were so frightened when it was bombing, and so was Raoul.</sentence><sentence id="632">But instead of being afraid then, he picked up the children, and he started to tell them stories, and he would, uh, imitate little animals, so that the children forgot to be afraid.</sentence><sentence id="633">And that was the most wonderful thing to see how he cared for these kids, and they called him Uncle Raoul.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="634">And this was his greatest and most horrible heartache, when one day he arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because we had these safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, what they called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">International Ghetto</span>, what it wasn't, it was given to us and not bought, by Christians and Jews who didn't wanted their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> on both sides of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> to fall in Russian, in uh, German hands.</sentence><sentence id="635">And they gave that to Raoul, and so immediately these people with these passes were put in there, even if they were not comfortable, but at least they had Raoul Wallenberg who came out twice a week, and there was medication and there was food.</sentence><sentence id="636">Otherwise, they were frightened and -------, but it was taken care of by young Aryan looking Jewish boys, who were dressed up in Nazi uniform, and so was one of this uh, wonderful <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="637">And one day, Raoul arrived, he has always visited the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, and he found all the children killed, and the young guard from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> could tell the story because he was hit in the shoulder, that these young punks came in and just started to shoot the kids.</sentence><sentence id="638">Well, one</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="642">little boy went under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> because when he thought that he sees his mother last, the mother says, "If anything happens just try to hide."</sentence><sentence id="643">He went under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, and when it was all over, he climbed out and he went out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and the first person he met was his mother, who was by then in a Raoul Wallenberg safe house.</sentence><sentence id="644">He is also in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> today, and the other one who survived was a woman whom I hoped you already interviewed, she is now professor of humanities and English in <span class="BUILDING">Mercer college</span> in <span class="REGION">NJ</span>: Dr. Vera Goodkin.</sentence><sentence id="645">She has been saved twice by Raoul.</sentence><sentence id="646">The second time she had scarlet fever, and she was in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, and Raoul had to give her some false papers, and she was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, that's why she wasn't killed.</sentence><sentence id="647">So these two people, and that was the only time I ever saw Raoul Wallenberg go down on his knees and cry bitterly.</sentence><sentence id="648">Because killing children was something he could have ever imagined that anyone can do.</sentence><sentence id="649">But then he got up again, and he was as tall as 7 foot, and he said, "I am fighting on because I want to save the young.</sentence><sentence id="650">Because the young are going to make peace."</sentence><sentence id="651">That was his idea.</sentence><sentence id="652">And, uh, in anything, uh, there was a young man who was then about 15, and his mother was taken, and they were crying.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="653">And he is today, he is a television and newspaper man in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, Teddy Lapin, I think is his name, if I remember, and he cried very bitterly when his mother gone, and in about an hour, suddenly, his mother arrived back with all the other women.</sentence><sentence id="654">And when they looked at each other, the mother, all she could say is, was "Wallenberg."</sentence><sentence id="655">And what happened, he heard about it that they taking women from, they came in through the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, and they just carried people out.</sentence><sentence id="656">And they went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> to kill them all, and suddenly, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> arrives, and this one man in a coat and hat, they already knew that must be Wallenberg, demanded that these are my people, and I, they are under my protection, and you Germans have absolutely no right to take them, and he brought them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="657">So he was again with his mother.</sentence><sentence id="658">And he did thousands and thousands of things, and never, never, ever thinking that he shouldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="659">And now you really thought that he has done everything.</sentence><sentence id="660">Now there was the Russians coming in, and everybody told him, "Raoul, don't go anywhere."</sentence><sentence id="661">But he said, "Yes, I want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Russian headquarters</span> because we need help for the people we saved."</sentence><sentence id="662">Now, there is a lot of stories about how he disappeared, but the real story I heard from the Swedish Red Cross man who was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and I met him later on.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="663">CR-6, <span class="BUILDING">Sync tape 7</span> is up.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="664">beep.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="668">Q: I want to go back, and I want you to explain to me what the shutzpass was--what it was, how he did it, and how big an endeavor it was.</sentence><sentence id="669">Remember that I have never heard of it before.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="670">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="671">Um, as I told you before, that the first eighty of these real passes, passports were given out, and Raoul was very annoyed.</sentence><sentence id="672">He said, "That, that's not enough, and we have 280,000 people to save."</sentence><sentence id="673">And he said, "I want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian headquarters</span> and talk to them."</sentence><sentence id="674">So he went to these Nazi people and he offered them to take the Jews off their hand because they still could have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, and he said, "I put up big <span class="DLF">railroads</span>, and I just take them all out."</sentence><sentence id="675">And uh, the Hungarians said, "Oh, that's wonderful, you can take 5,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="676">So, he tipped his hat and said, "Thank you."</sentence><sentence id="677">and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he said, "5,000 people, that's ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="678">They will never allow us any other, and he sat down, as he was a great draftsman and architect, and he has uh, designed a paper in the Swedish colors, yellow and blue, with the Swedish crowns there, and he explained that uh, what we will write on it, and I already once translated it word by word to the New York Times, and yet they put it down all wrong.</sentence><sentence id="679">It says exactly that the bearer of this shutzpass or this protective pass, and the picture was up there with the person's signature, is protected by the Swedish government and when and if we can go ina collective passport to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> after 2 wks, this paper will be invalid.</sentence><sentence id="680">That's all what it says, in German and in Hungarian, and yet you constantly, this was a passport, the people were Swedish citizens, no.</sentence><sentence id="681">So, he went with this beautiful paper with the Swedish uh, crown, the stamps on it from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span>, and each of them were signed by the ambassador, not by Raoul Wallenberg, because that too, they said, this was all fake, and they were no good.</sentence><sentence id="682">It's not true, it wasn't fake.</sentence><sentence id="683">It was real.</sentence><sentence id="684">And with this paper, he went back to the Hungarians, and they said, "All right, you can make out about 15,000.</sentence><sentence id="685">Well, of course, we made out 30 to 40,000 of these, and people came up to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> by the thousands to bring their pictures to put on and to, to.</sentence><sentence id="686">Now, thousands and thousands of people, yes, have been saved.</sentence><sentence id="687">How much money Raoul gave the Germans, we don't know, but he blew them up as big as the <span class="DLF">wall</span> on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="688">And it said that anybody who has these papers should be left uh, uh free.</sentence><sentence id="689">Now, my 2 girlfriends whom I told you uh came after uh being early morning there to report, uh the German officer must have heard that they had a German accent because they had a Hungarian father, but they went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after he died.</sentence><sentence id="690">And he said them in German, "You know what you can do with the</sentence><sentence id="692">paper."</sentence><sentence id="693">But, the 2 girls turn around and run and he never shot after them.</sentence><sentence id="694">So, they knew, the Hungarians were sort of different.</sentence><sentence id="695">They did that with my father, who was there when the girls arrived, and he cried bitterly because he loved them like his own, and he said, "I can't see all this crying anymore," so on his pajamas he put on his winter coat, and he said, "I'm going down to buy bread."</sentence><sentence id="696">Within a 1/2 an hour, we got a little note what he scribbled, and gave it to someone , that he is a <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="697">So, right away, I called Raoul, he was about going somewhere else, but he sent 2 diplomats with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and we went to look after my father all day, and we never found him.</sentence><sentence id="698">Next day, they came very early morning around 5:30 and we went again.</sentence><sentence id="699">finally, we came to a huge big <span class="BUILDING">sports palace</span>, and the 2 diplomats go in and I see them saying, "Heil Hitler!"</sentence><sentence id="700">and they running back and they said, "Your father is <span class="BUILDING">home</span>!"</sentence><sentence id="701">Do we have a phone?</sentence><sentence id="702">I said, "yes."</sentence><sentence id="703">So, we called <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and papa was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he told us what happened.</sentence><sentence id="704">He went down, he had the pass in his pocket, and this Hungarian punk came up, he says, "Hey, you Jew, show me your paper.</sentence><sentence id="705">And Papa pulled it out, and they said what he can do with it, and took him into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">A German officer walked in -- my father spoke perfect German, so he showed it to him, he threw him out.</sentence><sentence id="707">This went on about 20 times that they, the Hungarian took him back, the German let him out.</sentence><sentence id="708">Finally, the Hungarians warned and marched them for 8 hours to all the outskirts to the <span class="BUILDING">Sports Palace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">They stood there all night, Papa with his bread, and, uh, finally in the morning, two German officers came, and they were telling each other some jokes, and they laughed, and my father thought, "Good, this is the moment I can talk to them."</sentence><sentence id="710">And he walked up and he said, "Look what the Hungarians did to me!"</sentence><sentence id="711">and he was thrown out.</sentence><sentence id="712">And before that , he gave his bread to an old man, and besides him was a young man, he also had same paper, and he was thrown out, and this time Papi made it all the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="713">So, whether, again, whether Raoul bribed the Germans to do this, not every German did, but the Hungarians absolutely didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="714">Now, the fake came in very easily because there was a polish gentleman who saved people for 2 yrs, a Polish Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and when he was finished, he figured somehow he makes his way to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, maybe he can help because by that time he knew we were occupied.</sentence><sentence id="715">And he had a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printing machine</span>, and he found out there was an angel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> who's doing this.</sentence><sentence id="716">Now, Mr.Danielson's handwriting was very easy to fake, and he started to make these pass, passes, and he gave it out to people, and Raoul got wind of it, and met him and first very angrily he said, "How dare you are doing this because we can get in big trouble."</sentence><sentence id="717">And then, he put on his big smile, he said, "But, if you can save one human life, go ahead and do it."</sentence><sentence id="718">So, we had the feeling that maybe</sentence><sentence id="720">another hundred thousand people got saved with the fake paper.</sentence><sentence id="721">Because it was just the idea "save the people".</sentence><sentence id="722">And, we did as much as we could, and of course, many people died with the same paper too because the Hungarians don't care.</sentence><sentence id="723">So, it, it was a very exciting time, and, and uh, naturally the only thing, what was really needed was the real ambassador's handwriting on each of them.</sentence><sentence id="724">He was with us.</sentence><sentence id="725">He didn't like to do it, but he had to do it because Raoul make him do it.</sentence><sentence id="726">And Raoul never signed those papers.</sentence><sentence id="727">What Raoul signed was our working papers, what you probably can see here, that was his handwriting.</sentence><sentence id="728">And, uh, he was just wonderful, and that too, we were told all the time now, here, that they didn't believe it. "</sentence><sentence id="729">Oh, this working paper saved her life."</sentence><sentence id="730">No it didn't because in that time everyone, even a shoe shiner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> had to have a working paper because you could not just go around, whether you were Christian or Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="731">And many people got, died with this paper, and many people, as I was lucky, I lived with this paper.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="798">Q: Now, I want you to tell me the story about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> again, but I don't want you to refer back to telling it to me before, and I don't want you to talk about coming in like a teddy bear.</sentence><sentence id="799">I want you to tell it as though I've never heard it before, never met you before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="802">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="803">So, they, it was the coldest winter in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> for already uh, since beginning of October.</sentence><sentence id="804">So much so that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> was frozen with huge big slabs of ice.</sentence><sentence id="805">And this Hungarian Nazi party decided that the best way to kill people was to take them down on the side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> in a dark night and rope 3 together and shoot them into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">And they did that, it was no moonlight, no stars, it was just a very black night.</sentence><sentence id="807">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> wasn't around for 2 days.</sentence><sentence id="808">He was somewhere else saving people, and when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he heard this and he was besides himself. "</sentence><sentence id="809">What will Eichmann think next?!"</sentence><sentence id="810">And he turned around to us this time and he said, "How many of you can swim?"</sentence><sentence id="811">So I put my hand up, and I said, "I can," and we went down together to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>.</sentence><sentence id="812">We were all dressed in our winter coats and hats and boots and every time the Hungarians shot, 4 of us, there was 3 men and myself.</sentence><sentence id="813">We fell in, into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> at the same time, and thank you for the big icicles, the ropes hung on to the icicle and we knew where there is a rope there is a body, and we pulled the people out, and the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross trucks</span> were waiting with hot soup and change of clothes and there were doctors and nurses, and then we went to our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="814">But we only saved about 50 people because then we were so frozen that we didn't know whether we going forward or backwards.</sentence><sentence id="815">But 50 people without Raoul Wallenberg could not have</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="819">been saved.</sentence><sentence id="820">But because of him, we did save those 50 people, and I was lucky enough to, to meet someone a few years after who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nj</span> and he asked me if I saw the hole in his finger, and I said yes and he said that's where the bullet hit me, but you pulled me out, and I said, "I didn't."</sentence><sentence id="821">He said, "Yeah, you were the only girl, we met you after in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="822">So, it was a very good feeling.</sentence><sentence id="823">Is that what you wants to know?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="824"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beep</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="825">Q: Now I want to go back, and I want you to tell me what you think happened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="826">A: Well, what happened to Raoul Wallenberg, as I probably told you that, uh, he wanted to help the people whom he helped already, and he figured the, the Soviet is our allies, so we have to go to them to get some help, and everybody told him not to do it, because, let's wait how the Soviets will be with us, the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> said, but Raoul said, "No, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="827">I have to go and I have a 5 year plan--for the Soviet how to help these people to get back they <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and how we feed them, and we need medication."</sentence><sentence id="828">So nobody could talk, and he went with his driver, Wilmer Schlangfelder, together, and they went through that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debretzing</span>, that was the headquarter of the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="829">In a week, he came back, and that's how I know the story, because the Red Cross had--the Swedish Red Cross had--I met later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, and he said Raoul came back, and behind him there were two Russian officers on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorbikes</span>, and he said, "As you can see, I have some Russians behind me and I am invited back, and I have no idea if I am invited back as a visitor or as a prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="830">But, he said, "I had a wonderful meeting on the way back.</sentence><sentence id="831">I saw a, an old lady carrying bread in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span>, and she still had a star on, and I got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and I went over, and I said How wonderful to see that somebody is alive, my name is Raoul Wallenberg, and the lady pulled out the <span class="DLF">Schutzpass</span>.</sentence><sentence id="832">She says, "I know, I got one of your paper."</sentence><sentence id="833">And he said it was a very emotional moment for him too, and then he emptied his pockets, and he said to Mr. Langfelder, who was the head of the red cross, and he said, "Here, I give you all the money and all the diamonds because you will need it to feed the people whom we saved, but I keep a thousand dollars," and I tell you that because in a few minutes I tell you what happened to the thousand dollars.</sentence><sentence id="834">He said, "I keep this just in case my trip takes long."</sentence><sentence id="835">And then he said "Goodbye" and disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="836">Now, in 1945, the mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> got a phone call from the Russian ambassador Mrs. Colontery, telling her not to worry</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="840">about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="841">Raoul is in uh...not <span class="INT_SPACE">captivity</span>, they, she said, he, he is in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and we are taking care of him.</sentence><sentence id="842">So the mother was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="843">But Mrs. Colontery wasn't happy because every day she got phone calls, and she kept on saying, "You better don't ask so much.</sentence><sentence id="844">He is all right.</sentence><sentence id="845">We protecting him."</sentence><sentence id="846">But after a little while, Mrs. Colontery was called back, and miraculously she died in a heart attack in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volta</span>.</sentence><sentence id="847">And then they started to ask where is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="848">In the meantime, the whole <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> got back to uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, and I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> in 1945, and I said, "Where is Raoul?"</sentence><sentence id="849">and they said, "We don't know."</sentence><sentence id="850">They knew nothing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">And the Russian answer was that we never heard of him.</sentence><sentence id="852">He is not there.</sentence><sentence id="853">In'47, however, suddenly they said that yes, he was there, and he <span class="BUILDING">Ulanka prison</span>, he died in a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="854">The heart attack they described is for a big fat man, and Raoul Wallenberg was really not fat, and besides, I'm sure he didn't get hurt in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="855">So, they ask for the autopsy papers, and they disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="856">They ask for the doctor-- he wasn't alive anymore, so we knew that they lying.</sentence><sentence id="857">Then, as you know, in "57, Mr. Gromyko said that, uh, he's very sorry, but, yes, he's dead, and that's that.</sentence><sentence id="858">Now, the terrible thing is that we know now and we can't imagine why.</sentence><sentence id="859">I told you before that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> was sort of a spy center, and this Mr. Olson what even we didn't know, and I'm sure that Raoul had no idea, that he worked for the OSS.</sentence><sentence id="860">And when Raoul told the Russians that he was paid by the Americans, they must have had people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> to see him sitting with Mr. Olson, whom the Russians knew very well who he was.</sentence><sentence id="861">So they said, "Aha, Raoul Wallenberg is a spy."</sentence><sentence id="862">They also came up with stories what is not true--that Raoul once flew back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and while he was there, and he discussed things with the Germans what was an absolute lie.</sentence><sentence id="863">He could not, the only person who ever went back was Peranga because his wife was pregnant, and the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going, he went with her, and also a lady with her 2 little boys who was hidden with me--they went, and then ------ came back, and then they closed the curtain.</sentence><sentence id="864">That was it.</sentence><sentence id="865">Raoul never left, so he was not a spy, but the Russians took it in their head that he was an American spy, and also they didn't like the Jews more than the Nazis, so why this spy goes to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to save the Jews--this was to save, uh, so, we don't know, as Mr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="866">Wiesenthal said, "The Russian mind--the Soviet mind," he said that time, "is, is, is something you don't know what they thinking."</sentence><sentence id="867">And then, the whole world really just didn't care about him.</sentence><sentence id="868">His own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="869">And I remember how people did not believe.</sentence><sentence id="870">In 1945, September, I was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and I was so excited to tell that story because that wasn't a sorrowful story, this was a wonderful story, and my own family, my uncle, who was a very prominent gentleman-- he turned to my aunt when he thought I don't hear, and he said, "You better take this child to a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="874">psychiatrist, she's lying through her teeth.</sentence><sentence id="875">She's coming up with stories what happened not true."</sentence><sentence id="876">And I was hurt.</sentence><sentence id="877">And every time the phone rang, and my uncle gave it to me, and he said, "Oh, this must be the Russian, oh, the uh, the Swedish Ambassador."</sentence><sentence id="878">And they were very surprised when finally the Norwegian Ambassador called, and said that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross tank</span>, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, what are going to take me and many other people away, and it was, I talked to newspaper people, and they thought I was lying--such a person didn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="879">Then, when I arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, I thought, "Well, now I can talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>."</sentence><sentence id="880">Nobody wanted to hear it.</sentence><sentence id="881">I was a lecturer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with Count Bernodoch, who was also killed, unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="882">Count Bernodoch brought these very, very sick people in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, you name it, those who were still alive, he opened the most beautiful <span class="BUILDING">sanatoriums</span> and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to have these people.</sentence><sentence id="883">And I asked permission if | at least there can talk, at least to the Hungarians about Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="884">Well, they gave me the permission to do that.</sentence><sentence id="885">And nobody listened.</sentence><sentence id="886">Absolutely didn't wanted to listen.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="887">To the story.</sentence><sentence id="888">And I didn't know what happened to Raoul, and I, but then everybody was scared from the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="889">Everybody was learning Russian in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>--it was the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there, it was the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there, and it looked like the Russians will run them over any moment.</sentence><sentence id="890">So I wanted to get out, I had enough from the Nazis and the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="891">I brought my parents out, and they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> because they didn't let me in here.</sentence><sentence id="892">And, there I tried to talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>, and there some people listened.</sentence><sentence id="893">But, still, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="894">Then, I came over here, and nobody did anything.</sentence><sentence id="895">Finally, in the beginning in "80, there was Congressman Lantosh, who started to look for Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="896">He had his wife, and I told you that his wife was my little student back in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, but I didn't know that until 40 after that's her.</sentence><sentence id="897">And, then, they started to listen.</sentence><sentence id="898">My husband, whom I married in "60, we went on a 3 week honeymoon, and I told him the story and he was crying for 3 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="899">He was the only one who ever listened.</sentence><sentence id="900">And from then on, we are trying and trying, and nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="901">Now, they're working on it.</sentence><sentence id="902">And why I brought the thousand dollar up for you--two years ago was the first time that his half sister and half brother was invited to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and help them look for Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="903">Before they arrived there, the Russian television, what is like our Good Morning America, but it's only on Saturday goes out to something like 50 million people.</sentence><sentence id="904">They suddenly had Raoul Wallenberg's picture on the screen, and the phone number under it, and it said, Anyone who has any information about this person, gave his name, please call these nos.</sentence><sentence id="905">And every five minutes they showed that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="906">The <span class="BUILDING">Swedish embassy</span> was absolutely besides themselves, and from then on, they cared.</sentence><sentence id="907">They</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="911">suddenly allowed to talk about Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="912">They renamed the only <span class="BUILDING">burn center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span>--they renamed it the Raoul Wallenberg Medical Center.</sentence><sentence id="913">They now have documentaries, they have films, they have books, they came out with everything, and then they invited Gee and Nina, and they took Peranga with them, because after all, Per was the nearest one working with Raoul, and also they have a secretary who called Sonya Sonenfeld, who is Russian born, and they took her so that nobody can cheat when they talking Russian.</sentence><sentence id="914">Sakharrov was still alive, so he offered the family to help because he speaks English and he speaks Russian.</sentence><sentence id="915">And the first question...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="916">beep.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="917">A: Okay, so uh, the family arrived, and uh, there was tremendous crown already at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> from the whole world, all the newspaper came because this was really the first time that they allowed them to come.</sentence><sentence id="918">And they went first to the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span>, and then, they went to a part of where the KGB is, and Sakharrov went with them everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="919">The KGB's question was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sakharrov</span>, "How do we find--where do we start?"</sentence><sentence id="920">They had no idea to these KGB, they are also all young people.</sentence><sentence id="921">So Sakharrov said, "As far as I know, there is a key, what opens a big <span class="DLF">vault</span>, a huge <span class="DLF">vault</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="922">When you find the key, and you open it, you will find little sacks, and on each of them, the people's names.</sentence><sentence id="923">You will find <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="924">They found it.</sentence><sentence id="925">They brought out, and what they give back to the family was Raoul's passport, Raoul's personal papers, and the thousand dollars.</sentence><sentence id="926">That's why I mentioned the thousand dollars before--they didn't even take that away from him, and in 1945 that was a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="927">But that thousand dollars was with him.</sentence><sentence id="928">Now, what the KGB man did, he wrote out a receipt and he wanted Nina to sign it, and Sakharrov got very angry.</sentence><sentence id="929">He said, "Hey, wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="930">You arresting a man without any reason.</sentence><sentence id="931">You keep him in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for 46 years, and you want a receipt?!"</sentence><sentence id="932">So the KGB man said, "Sorry," and took the receipt and just gave everything back.</sentence><sentence id="933">And now we have an international committee in there, including two uh, humanitarian Russians, uh we have a Canadian professor, a mathematics professor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="934">We have, and I'm sure you heard his name, Dr. Martin Mackinin.</sentence><sentence id="935">That was the young man who was taken in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when Powell was there, remember Powell?</sentence><sentence id="936">And they exchanged them--he went to, and then Powell came out.</sentence><sentence id="937">Two years he was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, he did nothing, he went to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, but they said he was a spy.</sentence><sentence id="938">But, today he's a professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, and he is one</sentence><sentence id="940">of the men who is on this committee.</sentence><sentence id="941">And, uh, they found out fantastic things. #</sentence><sentence id="942">1: Every Russian citizen is now allowed to look for their dead person.</sentence><sentence id="943">It was written they are also dead like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="944">Now by the thousands they walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="945">The dead people walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">So nobody believed that Raoul is dead.</sentence><sentence id="947">somewhere he must be alive.</sentence><sentence id="948">They established absolutely for sure that he was never cremated because they have one <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in the whole Soviet Union or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> today, and their paper is as long as from here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>, and that took about 4 months to go through all the names, it's like a long toilet paper, Raoul Wallenberg's name is nowhere on.</sentence><sentence id="949">So he was not cremated.</sentence><sentence id="950">If he was killed, they must find somewhere his bones.</sentence><sentence id="951">That's how they found these Polish officers--they opened one, they thought Raoul is there, they found all those Polish officers.</sentence><sentence id="952">So we don't give up.</sentence><sentence id="953">He must be somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="954">And as you know, this August he will be 80 year old.</sentence><sentence id="955">And we want to make this year a Raoul Wallenberg international humanitarian year.</sentence><sentence id="956">And this idea comes from a lady whose name is Dr. Vera Permish, who is Russian.</sentence><sentence id="957">Who is a doctor of neurosurgery, who wrote lots and lots of papers, and she never heard of Raoul Wallenberg until 2 yrs ago, and he made a Wallenberg committee and he also has a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and he is in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> now medically and not medically and now she doesn't have to rush back, but when she came out it was still a communist country--now it's free.</sentence><sentence id="958">And she is trying to ask the whole world for sending poems, essays, paintings, songs, anything what can make Raoul happy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1009">Q: Let me ask you something generally.</sentence><sentence id="1010">How important are heroes?</sentence><sentence id="1011">And how important are heroes in connection with the Holocaust?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1015">A: Very, very, very important.</sentence><sentence id="1016">Especially for our American youth, as you know, we do not have any heroes.</sentence><sentence id="1017">Because I don't believe that the great sports figures are heroes.</sentence><sentence id="1018">They can be idols, but they're certainly not heroes.</sentence><sentence id="1019">A hero is a man who does something for humanity without getting paid for it, and there are very few.</sentence><sentence id="1020">And I think I could name just a few who were like Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1021">And these heroes are important, because the whole youth of the world don't see the importance of being wonderful and caring people, and the only way they can learn when they listen to these stories about Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1022">I know I had the experience what children can do when they realize what one single person can do.</sentence><sentence id="1023">If you're interested I can tell you two wonderful stories.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1024">The one was , we have the <span class="BUILDING">Raoul Wallenberg school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1025">And, uh, one little boy is all, well, most of them are already in <span class="BUILDING">Junior high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1026">Two years ago I was invited to see Fiddler on the Roof.</sentence><sentence id="1027">The teacher called me, she says, "It's all Wallenberg children from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> are playing it."</sentence><sentence id="1028">And there was one little boy who was 2 hrs, he was Tabia.</sentence><sentence id="1029">He sang, he ad- libbed, he spoke Hebrew, he did everything, he was absolutely magnificent.</sentence><sentence id="1030">2 hours non-stop.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1031">And when it was over, I knew I remembered something of the boy, but I didn't know what, so when the teacher called me, she said, "You remember Johnny?"</sentence><sentence id="1032">and I said, "I do," but what do I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1033">Well, I said, "First of all the boy is a Christian, and look how beautiful he speaks Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="1034">The secondly is he has a terrible asthma condition, and when he said to me, "Mrs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1035">Shapiro, I want to be Tabia," I didn't know how to answer him and I said but, "What's going to happen Johnny if you get a coughing fit?"</sentence><sentence id="1036">And he said, "Agi,"--the kid was like Wallenberg, he was not 4 ft, he was 7 ft, and he looked at me, he said, "If Raoul Wallenberg could do what he did, I can do it."</sentence><sentence id="1037">You see what a mind, and if you can tell the children the right way--what it means to be a person who cares--he wanted to make other people so for 2 years, he never coughed for 2 hrs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1038">The other one happened when I was a school librarian in another <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, and in the last 1/2 hour of the day, the teacher came up with a class, and he said, "I can do nothing with these kids, maybe you tell them the Wallenberg story."</sentence><sentence id="1039">So I did.</sentence><sentence id="1040">And when the bell went, everybody just sat there, and the teacher said, "Don't you kids want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1041">And they said, "No, could Mrs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1042">Adachi talk a little longer?"</sentence><sentence id="1043">So, I said, "If you don't hurry, I don't hurry."</sentence><sentence id="1044">And I told them that</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1048">getting involved doesn't mean if two people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> killing each other, that you go in the middle, because you get killed.</sentence><sentence id="1049">But use your noodles like Raoul used to.</sentence><sentence id="1050">What can I do immediately?</sentence><sentence id="1051">Okay, they went, I forgot about the story, 3 weeks after I am sitting security at lunch time.</sentence><sentence id="1052">Suddenly I see one little boy coming in, takes my pencil and paper, the other one comes in hands it to the secretary, and I said, "What's going on?"</sentence><sentence id="1053">The secretary I hear calling the police.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1054">And before the Principal walks out, I can hear the police arriving.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Suddenly 3 kids come in from this class, they're all 6th graders.</sentence><sentence id="1056">One is scratched, his shirt is all torn, I said, "What happened?!"</sentence><sentence id="1057">Well, the ball, they were playing ball, the ball went out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, the boy went out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> to pick up the ball and there was a log, and he wants to pick up the log, when a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> comes and a man opens the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and he said, "Leave that log there!"</sentence><sentence id="1058">And the kid like you would do or I would do put up his shoulder, and he says, "OK!"</sentence><sentence id="1059">For this okay, the man came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and brutally started to hit him because he answered back.</sentence><sentence id="1060">Now what are my children doing?</sentence><sentence id="1061">He came in, he picked up the paper and the pencil, he put down the license number, the other one run in and gave it to the thing.</sentence><sentence id="1062">By the time, as I said, the principal went out, the man was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Stolen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, crazy man, and then all 3 kids look at me, they said, "Would Wallenberg be proud of us?"</sentence><sentence id="1064">So you see, I am sure that these 3 kids, whenever they will go out anywhere, and they are now <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, or maybe already in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, they will never do anything wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1065">They will always look, "How can I help other people?"</sentence><sentence id="1066">And that's why, uh, my committee is every year giving <span class="BUILDING">senior high school</span> students Raoul Wallenberg humanitarian awards.</sentence><sentence id="1067">I don't want a child who has high grades.</sentence><sentence id="1068">I don't care what they do in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I want to know what they have done 4 yrs <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1070">And you'd be surprised the most magnificent things these children do.</sentence><sentence id="1071">Looking after AIDS children.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1072">These are 16, 17 year old kids.</sentence><sentence id="1073">They are going to <span class="BUILDING">nursing homes</span>, they reading to people, they, they doing the most fascinating things.</sentence><sentence id="1074">They walking blind people.</sentence><sentence id="1075">They, they--it is wonderful, I wish I could give them instead of just a frame, something, I could give them at least 100 dollars but I don't have the money.</sentence><sentence id="1076">But, there again, I know that these children look for that every year, who can be the best, and they do work 4 yrs.</sentence><sentence id="1077">That is the importance of a hero if you ask me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1078">beep</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1079">Q: I want you to tell me what it feels like to have been a rescuer, and what it felt like then to be</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1083">involved in this.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1090">A: Well, I, when I was that young, and I had someone like Raoul Wallenberg, it was nothing, it was a natural thing, like it must have been for him.</sentence><sentence id="1091">It, it was a wonderful feeling that I could save my parents, that I could save my cousins.</sentence><sentence id="1092">Again, it was a miracle because, as I said, many people with the same papers died, but we were lucky, but it was a tremendous feeling to be there and be able to do something.</sentence><sentence id="1093">I didn't know the meaning, I just knew that now I have the power to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1094">And I did it.</sentence><sentence id="1095">And, because I was young, and because I wanted to live so badly, because the life was so short then, and we haven't lived yet.</sentence><sentence id="1096">So it was so important to be able to be doing this, and it was the most fantastic feeling, that you know that you can hold somebody's hand, and that you saved it, like a friend of mine trusted me with her child once, and that was when the Russians were already in, but they were still fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1097">The Germans went to Buda's side, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> they were shooting, and my friends came to me, and they said, "Would you take our little girl to the nuns?"</sentence><sentence id="1098">And here we were, walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where they were shooting, and the little girl was so frightened and I said, "Well, what did Raoul do?</sentence><sentence id="1099">He said, "stories," so I started the children's story, and in the meantime we ducked, and somehow we survived, and I took the children, the child to the nuns, and next day the parents went back, and under the <span class="DLF">window</span> they brought her out, but you never thought of being afraid because that was the strength, that was the most wonderful feeling that you can do something.</sentence><sentence id="1100">You never thought of it that you get uh, paid for it, or praised for it, it was a natural thing.</sentence><sentence id="1101">But, sometimes it was a horrifying too, like when, as I said, they were already bombing, uh, or I mean uh shooting each other, and uh, we had shortage of water, and I remember that uh, two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> from us, there were a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and they had a uh, a uh, uh, what you call it a...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1114">Q: A <span class="DLF">well</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1116">A: A well, thank you.</sentence><sentence id="1117">Sometimes I don't come to the words.</sentence><sentence id="1118">And I wanted my father to be shaved</sentence><sentence id="1120">so I went down to get the water, and uh, again, who cares what's coming around you, don't hear it really, you know, only the last minute, a shhhhhhhh, and there was an old gentleman who came out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and up there was his wife, and waiting, and he came with the water, and suddenly, we heard this, and the man besides me fell.</sentence><sentence id="1121">And I was so shocked, why not me, why him?</sentence><sentence id="1122">And he was killed right there before my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1123">And yet, I had to go on, and his wife came down, there was, we couldn't really stop, and I brought the water <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I couldn't tell my parents because I was shaking, but then you had to go again, you know, and again, and, and, and, you had to save a child here, a child there, even when the Russians were in already.</sentence><sentence id="1124">Now, today, it is a far more difficult thing, it upsets me much more.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Why was I so...strong?</sentence><sentence id="1126">Why didn't I do it?</sentence><sentence id="1127">Or, how dare I was to do it rather, that's a question.</sentence><sentence id="1128">But, I always come back to the same answer, because we had such a wonderful hero, who wouldn't like it today if somebody would call him a hero.</sentence><sentence id="1129">He was just a regular young man, but he was full of pranks and jokes, but he gave us that enormous strength, and I'm trying today, even if I couldn't do such things anymore as jumping to the cold water--eh, today if I just see cold water, I get frozen, that's why maybe I always need the boots, but, what you have to go on teaching our children to be that strong, and that caring, and that their eyes should be open, what they can do to others, without prejudice, what also Raoul Wallenberg taught us.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And I think I took that over, and I, I will always do it, and I, I, I am proud of it ifI can.</sentence><sentence id="1131">I know my children had lots of wonderful black friends who slept over in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they all became lawyers and doctors and, and whatever, they great kids, and my neighbor, who unfortunately came out with a terrible word, she's an Arab Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Persia</span>, and she came out she says, "Why do you let that nigger into your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1132">And I looked at her, I said, "You of all people, asking me this?"</sentence><sentence id="1133">And I said, "Besides, I don't see they color."</sentence><sentence id="1134">And then when I was at my <span class="DLF">door</span>, I turned around and I said, "It's interesting enough, they put their slacks on the same way as my sons, and I banged the <span class="DLF">door</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1135">But this all what we have, that's what Raoul said to us, he always talked about, "I want to save the young, because only the young can make peace."</sentence><sentence id="1136">And finally, once while we were waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross truck</span>, I asked him, I says, "Raoul, explain, 1am young.</sentence><sentence id="1137">What do you want us young people to do?"</sentence><sentence id="1138">Not that he was so much older--ten years or something, and he said, "Oh, Agi, it's so easy, prejudice has to disappear.</sentence><sentence id="1139">In my book, I am color blind, I am religious blind, I only know two kinds of people, the good and the bad.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And if you good, try to make the bad better."</sentence><sentence id="1141">That was all he said.</sentence><sentence id="1142">But his dream was always that one day all the children will come out and hold hands.</sentence><sentence id="1145">But you see we can't do this unless we teach our children.</sentence><sentence id="1146">Two years ago I was invited to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1147">The principal called me and he said, "Now, Agnes, I want you to know we have 99% black children, the rest of it is kids in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchairs</span>, Jews and Orientals.</sentence><sentence id="1148">I said, "Fine.</sentence><sentence id="1149">Can I speak of all Holocaust?"</sentence><sentence id="1150">He said, "What all Holocaust?"</sentence><sentence id="1151">I said, "Well, don't you know what they're doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1152">What happens in <span class="REGION">Central America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1153">What happened to the 3 million people who Hitler killed besides the 6 million Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="1154">Well, he didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1155">I says, "Can I or can I not talk?"</sentence><sentence id="1156">He said, "Yes, You can."</sentence><sentence id="1157">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1158">Now what I didn't know that he invited the whole ward--Ward 22.</sentence><sentence id="1159">And when uh, the kids were wonderful, 300 of them in a huge big <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span>, and everybody looked at me, and then, uh, when I was finished with the story, nobody moved, the kids were wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1160">And then I asked the black children, "Do you know about the <span class="BUILDING">Ku Klux Klan</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1161">Blank.</sentence><sentence id="1162">And then I looked back at the board, and everybody pulls up the shoulder.</sentence><sentence id="1163">I, I thought that's terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1164">Then I looked at the little Jewish kids whom I thought, I said, "Did you hear about neo-Nazis?"</sentence><sentence id="1165">Blank.</sentence><sentence id="1166">So, I explained to the kids that they are both very bad people, and they are against us all, and if you kids don't look out for each other, then we all perish, but you can do it together.</sentence><sentence id="1167">You can all do it together, and you can love each other, and forget colors, religions, anything.</sentence><sentence id="1168">You will have to be just standing up very proud.</sentence><sentence id="1169">And suddenly I see a black and a white lad, hugging, two boys, holding their hands, and then, suddenly the 300 kids got up and gave me a standing ovation, and I cried.</sentence><sentence id="1170">And the board says they had never seen this, I says, "What is with you people?</sentence><sentence id="1171">You teach nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1172">Absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1173">You come to the Holocaust, and you say that many people were killed, and how they were killed--children are not interested that way.</sentence><sentence id="1174">But teach them who else is out there.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And if, if they don't look out for each other, they all get killed, because they're black and because they're Jewish, and the little boy in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> came up and said, "Ms. Adachi, will you come to my ballgame, I am great in playing."</sentence><sentence id="1176">I said, "Of course."</sentence><sentence id="1177">And you see, this what, I am getting too old and I wish a lot of young people would go out and talk to the children, I'm asking children to talk to other kids, to tell them that we are all one, and especially <span class="BUILDING">Junior high school</span> kids, they already thinking themselves they have a mind.</sentence><sentence id="1178">The parents tell them don't talk to him because he is this and don't talk to him because he's that.</sentence><sentence id="1179">And that's no good and that was not Raoul Wallenberg's dream.</sentence><sentence id="1180">But, I think we do reach a lot of children, and if we don't reach more than five kids in every class, in every <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, then there is five better children in the world.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And I think it's so important.</sentence><sentence id="1182">And I, I, I'm going to meet by chance this Hungarian</sentence><sentence id="1184">ambassador to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, and we ask him to try to have the <span class="COUNTRY">U.N.</span> accept this year as Raoul Wallenberg humanitarian year.</sentence><sentence id="1185">And help us to read those poems, grown-ups and children will write, or have a beautiful symphonic poetry, what is written by an American com, uh, American playwright, and a Swedish composer.</sentence><sentence id="1186">They should play that because it's for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1187">We're also trying to build a very great, the first in the world Raoul Wallenberg Center for the Arts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1188">What we already started many years ago, and then all our money was stolen, I want to get into that, but these things happen, but now the Senate wants to help.</sentence><sentence id="1189">So, this would be one of the greatest 80th birthday presents to Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1271">beep.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1273">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1274">Tell it to me as though you didn't tell it to me before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1277">A: Well, you have to know that Raoul saved over 100,000 people, but many times, here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> especially, people say, Oh, don't tell me that, he didn't even save 5,000.</sentence><sentence id="1278">Well, if he didn't do that, the very last act he had, he saved 70,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="1279">So even if he didn't save anyone else, 70,000 would be quite enough.</sentence><sentence id="1280">And how that happened is that the Nazis finally decided they have to make a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1281">And we have a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> around it became the ghetto.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And they pushed 70,000 people in there.</sentence><sentence id="1283">Now, uh, the only way we could get in there was that our Red Cross People, Swedish Red Cross, went in.</sentence><sentence id="1284">Almost every week twice, and brought them some food and medication, and, see what had to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1285">But otherwise we had not much connection, just try to take care of it, that people won't be taken.</sentence><sentence id="1286">One day a Hungarian Nazi officer came to uh Raoul, who thought that maybe Raoul will help him after the Soviet occupation because the Soviet was already on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1287">And said to him, "Raoul, Eichmann ordered to kill the 70,000 people in the uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and uh, guns are already standing there.</sentence><sentence id="1288">And Raoul said, "Oh my God!</sentence><sentence id="1289">And our 2 Red Cross girls are just in there now!Go back to your <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and tell them that the Na, uh <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> called off the killing."</sentence><sentence id="1290">The Hungarian left immediately, and Raoul looks at us, it was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, in the one of</sentence><sentence id="1292">the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> where we worked on that day, and he said, "Now listen to me what I'm going to do."</sentence><sentence id="1293">And he picked up the phone, as he spoke beautiful German, and he called the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span>, and he said, "This is Lieutenant Kraus.</sentence><sentence id="1294">I want to speak to the General."</sentence><sentence id="1295">Naturally to Lieutenant Kraus, they give the General immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1296">And when the General came to the phone, Raoul said, "This is Raoul Wallenberg."</sentence><sentence id="1297">And uh, the man was surprised but he couldn't hang up, and Raoul said to him, "Uh, General, I do not understand what you're doing.</sentence><sentence id="1298">I understand you are a very highly decorated first world war general.</sentence><sentence id="1299">How can you take it on your heart and conscience to kall 70,000 innocent people plus my 2 Swedish Red Cross girls who are in there?"</sentence><sentence id="1300">Whereby he must have answered, "Eichmann did it."</sentence><sentence id="1301">Now how daring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="1302">Eichmann could have stood right next <span class="DLF">door</span> to the general, but how, Raoul know he had to think fast, and he said, "Eichmann?!Didn't you know Eichmann left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I had lunch with him yesterday."</sentence><sentence id="1303">Whereby the General said, "I didn't know that."</sentence><sentence id="1304">So Raoul said, "All right, then you are responsible.</sentence><sentence id="1305">And if you are not calling off the killing within 5 minutes, I as a Swedish diplomat tell you, you will be the first one hanging before your <span class="BUILDING">office</span> as soon as the Russians reach us here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">midtown</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1306">In 4 minutes, he called off the killing, and thereby he saved 70,000 people, plus the 2 girls from the Swedish Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1307">That was <span class="BUILDING">Raoul Wallenberg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1343">Q: One more story that's in your other transcript was about the curfew and the little child who was out | minute after curfew, and a doctor who tried to help him.</sentence><sentence id="1344">Remember that story?</sentence><sentence id="1345">They were lined up and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1349">A: That was not my story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1351">Q: Okay, um, can you talk to me a little more about how hard it was to believe what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1353">A: Yes, it was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1354">I don't if for everybody, but for me it was because I never knew cruelty, or because I also had a father who believed that everybody is equal, and it was a horror to see that our young life can be snatched out in one second, for what?</sentence><sentence id="1355">Just because you were a Jew, or just because you were an anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="1356">It was a horrible feeling that you never know what happens the</sentence><sentence id="1358">next minute.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And it was a very frightening thing to, to think, "How can you get out of this?</sentence><sentence id="1360">How can you, save yourself, and save someone else?!</sentence><sentence id="1361">Well, of course, after Raoul, it was much easier because somehow he was the head and we were the body.</sentence><sentence id="1362">But, before he came, uh, even in that 3 weeks, eh, in that <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> up at the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span>, you were thinking, "Well, what's going to happen to my parents?</sentence><sentence id="1363">How can I get them saved?"</sentence><sentence id="1364">So the constant worry because we didn't know what these crazy people are doing, it was a horrifying time.</sentence><sentence id="1365">And especially, as I said, because when you're so young, to think of it that what is in the future?</sentence><sentence id="1366">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1367">It's a very frightening feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1368">It's an incredible feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1369">What is very hard to explain, but the only help maybe was that that big radio I had, and that electricity was still on so that we could hear from those out of <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> what's happening, and that always gave a hope of well, the allies won't let us down, and the allies will help, and the allies didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="1370">So, it wasn't very easy.</sentence><sentence id="1371">And I remember when we were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, when, when we had bombing and uh, they made it as a joke, but it wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="1372">There was one old lady who constantly said "Oh my God, Oh my God, Where are they?"</sentence><sentence id="1373">because they weren't bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1374">And somebody said, "Well, why are you so worried that that they taking care of us?"</sentence><sentence id="1375">And then suddenly the bombing started, and the old lady looked up and says, "Thank you Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1376">Now you're here."</sentence><sentence id="1377">She was relieved, but that's how we all felt, that the allies must be helping us.</sentence><sentence id="1378">The allies must be there.</sentence><sentence id="1379">And they weren't always there.</sentence><sentence id="1380">And it was frightening that we didn't know that, that we had truly the whole Balkan was given away to the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="1381">We didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="1382">And we were not expecting the Soviets to liberate us.</sentence><sentence id="1383">Maybe if the American liberated us, I could have never left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1384">But, I did leave.</sentence><sentence id="1385">So, and many, many other people were like that.</sentence><sentence id="1386">And it wasn't easy.</sentence><sentence id="1387">We had, uh, when I went back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, for instance, uh, when you went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> when it was bombing, the faces were all new.</sentence><sentence id="1388">Well, we only found out after the war that there were quite a few Jews there who had Christian papers, and that's how they survived.</sentence><sentence id="1389">But there were also a very good-looking elderly gentleman with a younger son, and a mother, and a wife, and he always looked at me and I looked at him, and I had no idea who he could be, and then one day he asked me where I'm always going, and I don't know why I, I, I believed in the man so you come out and telling him.</sentence><sentence id="1390">He said, "I wish I could go with you," and I said, "Well, who are you?"</sentence><sentence id="1391">And it turned out he was the only Hungarian General who got away from the Germans, and he took some false papers, but he gave me his real name, General Gutweih, and he happened to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and find an <span class="BUILDING">apt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1392">His son committed suicide, thanks God</sentence><sentence id="1394">they put him back.</sentence><sentence id="1395">And he was my ally, he had by that time the radio upstairs didn't work, but he had a little radio with batteries, and in that one we heard the BBC telling us that <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> was already free, and it was occupied by British, French, uh, and uh the Russians, and then he was the on who one day run in and says, "Come out and see what's happening!"</sentence><sentence id="1396">and we looked out by our <span class="DLF">port</span>, big <span class="DLF">port door</span>, and the German weapons were lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> like this, he said, "The Russians must be in there."</sentence><sentence id="1397">And then he and his son was the first one out.</sentence><sentence id="1398">The Russians knew everything, they took them away, and we were so worried, and they came back after 3 days.</sentence><sentence id="1399">The interrogation was incredible.</sentence><sentence id="1400">Girls, uh military girls interviewed them with caviar and drinks for 3 days.</sentence><sentence id="1401">Of course, they both threw their drinks over their shoulders, and they wanted to know whether they really are the person who they are, and they were not Nazis and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1402">It was a frightening time, but he was a great ally for us and wonderful...and it, it, it was uh, a frightening time.</sentence><sentence id="1403">It was a very frightening time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
