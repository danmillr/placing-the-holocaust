<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Military friends from World War 1.</sentence><sentence id="8">And then the Soviets ordered all people should return to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">So we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">And after a few weeks they ordered all students return to their <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>, but because of the extra-curriculum given by Russians in Russian language in Communist history, in party Communist history, we were taken one year back -- because they told us we complete our education as Communists after two years of indoctrination.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: So you were in <span class="BUILDING">classes</span> learning Russian now and Soviet propaganda?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Why did you want to escape?</sentence><sentence id="46">What was your goal?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Good question, because they started to arresting all Polish intelligent family members such as doctors, lawyers, former police department members.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: That was in January?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: That was January 1940.</sentence><sentence id="63">Taking advantage of -- they gave us two weeks vacation.</sentence><sentence id="64">So arriving to this last <span class="BUILDING">station</span> I had to go about five miles on foot with a group of some people.</sentence><sentence id="65">They thought I know more about the location of the <span class="DLF">border line</span> than themselves.</sentence><sentence id="66">And I led them directly to the <span class="BUILDING">guards building</span> and when we started running away, they noticed us and they started shooting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: These were the Russian guards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Russian guards and I was caught first time when I tried to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">And as penalty they placed us in the <span class="BUILDING">brick outhouse</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lower level</span> where I had to stand in excrement, human excrement up to my knees.</sentence><sentence id="76">So I couldn't kneel.</sentence><sentence id="77">I couldn't relax, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="78">I had to stand there for three days before they took us out and they told us, now go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> and you should study because you are a young student and you will be a good Consumer (?).</sentence><sentence id="79">Then I cried but I had to try again.</sentence><sentence id="80">So with my second try, instead of turning left, I turned right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did you go all the way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: NO, NO, NO, NO.</sentence><sentence id="91">Right after this maybe I went two kilometers towards the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then I turned sideways when I noticed, because that was during the night, I noticed they couldn't see me anymore and I tried again, with the help, of course, of one guy who was also crossing not the first time.</sentence><sentence id="92">And he helped me out and I found myself on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="93">People on the borderline were very wonderful people.</sentence><sentence id="94">They fed me, they washed me a little bit, because I stunk like a beaver.</sentence><sentence id="95">And after a few hours I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.15" long="22.267">Siedlce</span> because I thought my grandmother is still in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.15" long="22.267">Siedlce</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">When I arrived there I only met my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="97">My grandmother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="98">So between January of 1940 -- oh while reaching the <span class="NPIP">destination</span>, I sent a message to my mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilaka</span> a friend who was leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> because he had a family over there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Was he crossing from the <span class="REGION">German side</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He was crossing from the <span class="REGION">German side</span> to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">And I give him description how I crossed and I urged them also to try to come over.</sentence><sentence id="112">You see the difference between <span class="REGION">Russian occupational zone</span> and German was that they were both death enemies of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">However, on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> you could at least dress as a civilized people.</sentence><sentence id="114">You could use your tie, you could use your hat, you could use your nice shirt, versus looking like a peasant all the time and be completely as a savage looking.</sentence><sentence id="115">So this is, you should remember, this is the reason why so many people couldn't stand Communists because that was hypocrisy to the highest extent.</sentence><sentence id="116">Now what struck me first on my arrival to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.15" long="22.267">Siedlce</span> that Jewish people, they were wearing the armbands with the Star of David and they had to take hats off and step aside before every German soldier.</sentence><sentence id="117">So you could see that that was horrible experience right from the start.</sentence><sentence id="118">And I was wondering right then how long I would be safe in this <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: Did anybody ever check your documents at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: How would you clean the mortar off?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: With chisels, and once you cleaned a thousand bricks a day, you had good pay.</sentence><sentence id="148">And so I worked there, but it was too hard for me.</sentence><sentence id="149">So after two months, that was about March, in March I met one friend who suggested to me we should open photographic business because Germans were taking pictures of all the <span class="DLF">Polish ruins</span> and Polish various monuments and everything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
