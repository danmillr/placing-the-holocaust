<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Was this in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.166389" long="-0.345278">Caen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

said.</sentence><sentence id="558">They came upstairs -- Oh, and what I have to preempt this with was that they had tried to warn us that they had to come and inspect the <span
