"</sentence><sentence id="114">We have in possession all of your sermons which you delivered to the French radio to the Polish people against our German system.</sentence><sentence id="115">You will not be free anymore.</sentence><sentence id="116">This is the day that we make really the end to your freedom.</sentence><sentence id="117">You come with us and we will place you in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>."</sentence><sentence id="118">You see 26...26th of October 1940, I was arrested and placed then in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">And then there I was...from October 26th to November 26th, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="120">That is to say, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, Parisian...<span class="BUILDING">Parisian prison</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Father, don't...don't worry about dates.</sentence><sentence id="155">Truly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Tell...tell me why you had been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="161">The Gestapo referred to radio programs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: You see...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Tell me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Because...because they collected my radio sermons and believed that I am great enemy of Nazis, and they have not tolerated...you see people also in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> who would say something against them, for the Nazis, for the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="169">You see their system was sacred.</sentence><sentence id="170">Nobody had the right to offend them.</sentence><sentence id="171">And then I always remained with the same conviction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: What had you been saying on the radio?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Well, that Nazism, Hitlerism is not only an enemy of Jewish people, but they are also anti- Christian system.</sentence><sentence id="179">That is to say, not only a system to purify <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from Jewish population, but also to not with us.</sentence><sentence id="180">It was impossible for them, but to take really under their influence the whole <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">And then...so in my radio sermons, as I told you enlighten by the French government, I consoled the Polish people already occupied by Nazi Germany that Nazism really must collapse because it is not only anti-Jewish system, but anti-Christian and human system.</sentence><sentence id="182">Everything what was for us dignified, you see, was just condemned by Nazis, rejected by Hitlerism.</sentence><sentence id="183">And do not forget I told them that the whole world is not dependant of Nazis, but God is taking care of us.</sentence><sentence id="184">And so do not cooperate.</sentence><sentence id="185">Do not get discouraged.</sentence><sentence id="186">You will suffer no doubt, but in your suffering you will find always our sympathy and the sympathy of the whole Europe.</sentence><sentence id="187">And because, you see, of this tax of this approach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person.</sentence><sentence id="188">So they considered me as an Enemy No.</sentence><sentence id="189">1.</sentence><sentence id="190">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> after 1 month of being in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, I was just transferred...transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and on my way to in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, I was few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span>, ___, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>, and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> on December the 10, 1940...1940 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, __.</sentence><sentence id="191">And really that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was a place of torture.</sentence><sentence id="192">And...uh...you see no freedom.</sentence><sentence id="193">Just closed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some part in the of all the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="194">Twice a month I was able to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">Otherwise, <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> was my unique, only <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live.</sentence><sentence id="196">But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I was really taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">black cell</span>, that is to say without a light, without a light, without water, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days.</sentence><sentence id="197">That is to say, imagine only you have no possibility to look through the <span class="DLF">window</span> because everything was closed.</sentence><sentence id="198">You didn't have any possibility to take water or some...take some food because they didn't bring it to you.</sentence><sentence id="199">After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="200">But this was not sufficient for them.</sentence><sentence id="201">You see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated me so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living any more, but to be sure they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where conditions were certainly not easy but better than the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">So after some days I have recuperated and then they have taken me back to the .</sentence><sentence id="203">But with more normal conditions of life.</sentence><sentence id="204">That is to say, I have received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the Priminate twice a month.</sentence><sentence id="205">And from ____ I was from December 10, 40.</sentence><sentence id="206">On July 29, 41, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and then transferred to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">And then I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachenhausen</span> on July 29th, 41, and was there to February the 3rd, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="208">And there I was also...uh...well, what I say, exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="209">You see because the conditions in the camp of concentration are not easy or were not easy.</sentence><sentence id="210">Neither here nor there.</sentence><sentence id="211">And so after 3 weeks in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I was for them fit to be transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="248">Let's stop a moment.</sentence><sentence id="249">If you could.</sentence><sentence id="250">I want to put this down.</sentence><sentence id="251">Can we stop and pause the tape a moment please.</sentence><sentence id="252">Uh...Steven, are you there?</sentence><sentence id="253">Can you...we're having sawing or hammering of some kind coming through.</sentence><sentence id="254">Would you please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Okay, Father we are back on camera.</sentence><sentence id="264">You had wanted to tell us the dates of where you were on each <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: But I have already told you.</sentence><sentence id="268">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="269">And we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> I was from July 29, 41 to February, the 3rd, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="270">And then I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> to the prisons of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kothen</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">And on February the 13th, 1942, I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">And...uh...finally, we shall speak about it later, on Sunday, April 29, 1945, we were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="273">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="274">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>, you see, the conditions were not as cruel as in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="283">And I spent there some time just...uh...doing things as other prisoners and particularly taking care of cleaning the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">Deprived of any liberty!And then...then, of course, I was not beaten there as the other prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="285">And so I still was able to continue my life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, it was really not easy to live and to survive because as the renowned French politician wrote in his book, he was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, and in his book, Liberate Root of Liberty, he says in that book that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> for him was an organized <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">And you see if somebody very intelligent person really writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>, without any hope, without peace, without liberty.</sentence><sentence id="288">You have been considered just there as a mechanical instrument, moved here and there.</sentence><sentence id="289">And...uh...in my case as the Polish priest, also, we had to work everyday in this so called plantation.</sentence><sentence id="290">And the...the work was really not easy and then every day, every day the same work.</sentence><sentence id="291">And without enough food.</sentence><sentence id="292">And then with the spirit of persecution you see.</sentence><sentence id="293">All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work, we our not human and..uh.. although...although they were very...uh...I would say...uh...against all of us.</sentence><sentence id="294">Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see.</sentence><sentence id="295">And we did when they have...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best.</sentence><sentence id="296">When they disappeared, we just relaxed.</sentence><sentence id="297">And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen that we really were not working what they have beaten us.</sentence><sentence id="298">And you see, some Gestapo people were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness.</sentence><sentence id="299">And many people beaten, and the <span class="DLF">plantation</span> had to be transferred to the so-called <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">And there the Gestapo men finished them.</sentence><sentence id="301">You see, there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">I was there also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs.</sentence><sentence id="303">And...uh...we didn't have the true conditions which a sick person should have in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">You see, they treated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the proper food.</sentence><sentence id="305">But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and peace of heart.</sentence><sentence id="306">How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions?</sentence><sentence id="307">And I answered just by your faith.</sentence><sentence id="308">You see, if you believed in God, in his not only justice, but also Law, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to us, it is also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the other people.</sentence><sentence id="309">And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some suffering.</sentence><sentence id="310">St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to God that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete also that suffering by giving our part.</sentence><sentence id="311">And so if you have such faith that your suffering really can bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength to survive.</sentence><sentence id="312">And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you.</sentence><sentence id="313">It can break you if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of suffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can make you stronger.</sentence><sentence id="314">The more so stronger if you are a believer.</sentence><sentence id="315">If you think that everything is under the divine control.</sentence><sentence
