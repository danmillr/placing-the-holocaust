<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: No, I don't question any more, I think that I have my answers.</sentence><sentence id="59">I think I have my answers.</sentence><sentence id="60">I feel that the German nation was misled, and that there is not only -- there are</sentence><sentence id="62">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 4 two entities who are guilty of mass murder.</sentence><sentence id="63">We know of the executioners, it was Hitler's political cronies, who went along with him, to eliminate the Jewish people wherever he could get them.</sentence><sentence id="64">But anti-Semitism was -- or racism, whatever you want to call it, goes back centuries, many centuries, and the original sin was committed by Christians, by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, which actually propagated, I would say the -- the persecutions of Jews, by accusing the Jewish people of whatever was convenient for them.</sentence><sentence id="65">For instance, up to today, the idea that the Jews killed Christ, prevails within a large segment of people who do not know history.</sentence><sentence id="66">It is known, for instance, that the crucifixion was an act of erga -- Romans.</sentence><sentence id="67">It was their law by which they -- by which they sentenced people to death.</sentence><sentence id="68">The Jews stoned.</sentence><sentence id="69">And I want to tell you a very interesting story.</sentence><sentence id="70">I met, a year ago, a lady of the name Anna Rubenstein, who wrote a couple books, I believe three books.</sentence><sentence id="71">She a foo -- survivor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and after the war, because of her English lang -- English knowledge, she got a job in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> someplace in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to help displaced persons, from all over Europe, of different nationalities.</sentence><sentence id="72">And she became responsible for - - I believe, if I remember well, for 8,000 people, and got a very responsible, big job there.</sentence><sentence id="73">One day she got -- she was asked by a German doctor, whether she would come with him to inspect a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> of sick people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, which was also in that same s -- in that same <span class="REGION">area</span> where she worked.</sentence><sentence id="74">And when they entered a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span>, a woman attacked her verbally and physically in Polish, and told her, "You are Jewish, you should not be alive.</sentence><sentence id="75">You killed Christ."</sentence><sentence id="76">With this one sentence, this Polish woman told the whole story.</sentence><sentence id="77">The curse on the Jewish people, which is a historical injustice, carrying on through centuries, which culminated this time in the Holocaust, but there were many events prior to that.</sentence><sentence id="80">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 5 You can look at the Inquisition, the Crusades, at individual abuses of fiihrer, masters in Europe, in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, all over.</sentence><sentence id="81">Wherever Christianity was the main religion.</sentence><sentence id="82">And never was anything done on the side of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, to dispel these wrong rumors, even up to today.</sentence><sentence id="83">Whatever that Pope has done up to now, is by far not enough.</sentence><sentence id="84">I think the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> owes us an apology.</sentence><sentence id="85">They should -- stop it, please -- they should admit, confess, and atone for what they have done.</sentence><sentence id="86">I think this is what they owe us, and it would also elevate the moral standing of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, which up to today is only hiding and el -- and not coming out s -- directly of what happened.</sentence><sentence id="87">There's another interesting thing which came into my mind.</sentence><sentence id="88">Protestantism was founded in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at least, by Martin Luther.</sentence><sentence id="89">Martin Luther originally protested against the abuses of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, by being bought off for money, and ultimately was the founder of the Protestant movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">Although he was sensitive to what the abuses of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, he took with him the anti-Semitism of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, by putting his feces on the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, I believe, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brittenburg</span>, where he asked for the banishment of the Jews unless they became Christians, and of their -- of killing them, which is very interesting, and that only sh -- tells me how great and how deep the belief of the Jewish guilt was implanted in not only the population, but also among the intellectuals of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> itself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Let me ask you something.</sentence><sentence id="128">You've been living in a Christian country in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, for the last 50 years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Do you feel that there's a danger of something like what happened during World War Two, in Europe --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="138"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0048 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: -- to the Jews again?</sentence><sentence id="142">Do you feel that anti-Semitism is --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: 1 -- I do not believe that anything like that would be possible again, and I want to emphasize today, in my own mind, a tremendous change in government -- in government forming of -- of laws.</sentence><sentence id="144">Originally, if a government persecuted people, oppressed people, killed people, nobody interfered.</sentence><sentence id="145">At best -- There was an article in the paper, thanks to the courage of our President Clinton, and to NATO, that a change in this attitude finally came about, when we declared war on Milosevitch, who was oppressing his own people, and abusing the other minorities within <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">This is a historical event of tremendous impact for the future.</sentence><sentence id="147">And I think we should call this the Clinton Doctrine.</sentence><sentence id="148">I am -- I am highly impressed and very satisfied and happy that this happened, not because -- not because of myself, but in general terms, for the sake of mankind.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: You think this is the -- the first time that something like this has happened on a governmental level?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: I don't think, I know this is the first time, and never anything -- never anything like that happened.</sentence><sentence id="152">Even, you have a case here with Pinochet.</sentence><sentence id="153">There is still a dispute whether he is guilty or not guilty for killing people during the time when he was in power.</sentence><sentence id="154">Now they figured out that he is guilty now only from a certain date in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, when they reversed their thinking.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Do you think that -- that Clinton's and NATO's actions in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> are -- do you think there's a chance that they had anything to do with -- with Holocaust memory?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="161">Like if you're thinking back on what happened during the Holocaust and what -- what</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="165">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 a <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and the world did not do, there -- there -- perhaps there was pressure on the governments to actually take action now, in a way that they didn't then.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Well, I believe that a few sensitive people might have been influenced by the tremen - - by the terrific injustice which happened during the second World War, toward the Jewish people, and those who resisted the Nazi doctrines.</sentence><sentence id="167">But generally speaking, if -- if NATO, under the leadership of Clintons, wouldn't have done what they have done, the thing could have been again forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="168">As a matter of fact, from what I have been listening, to stories about the -- memorials about the Holocaust and so forth, nobody ever touched the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, which is guilty just as much as the Germans themselves, for what has happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Talking about -- about faith, and -- and religion and -- and -- and the influence of religion on prejudice, can you -- can you tell me the role that that's played in your life, and in -- in your own sense about --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Oh, I -- I can tell you as far as the religion is concerned, I personally believe that religions were necessary to raise the standards, the moral standards of the population.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="175">Whatever abuses happened later on, by trying to exert power over their own people, and oppress others, this is a different story.</sentence><sentence id="176">Personally, I was raised in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span>, by birth, but we were not religious.</sentence><sentence id="177">We kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span>, because of my father's father, who was a widower.</sentence><sentence id="178">When he passed away, in his early 80's, my sister and myself said, "Mom, let's stop that kosher deal, we want to eat everything."</sentence><sentence id="179">And that was the end of the <span class="BUILDING">kosher household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">Personally, I believe that Moses himself was one of the greatest, if not the greatest statesman, by inventing the 10 commandments and giving</sentence><sentence id="182">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0048 8 them to the people as a guide for morality, for life.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I also am convinced that Jesus, another Jew, was another very great man, great statesman, who spread the teachings of Judaism in his own way, as a Reformer of Judaism rather than sticking to the old ways of the Jewish religion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: So do you see them more as politicians in a sense, than spiritual figures?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Oh, they were spiritual figures, but with a political result.</sentence><sentence id="198">And the spirituality is terrific, if you can believe in it, and important is that you should then do what they tell you to do, what they wrote down that God said, but not whatever pleases anybody to his own advantage.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: You were just mentioning a moment ago, off tape, about yo-you -- before the war, as you said, you were an atheist.</sentence><sentence id="202">What did your experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, how did that influence your feelings about religion in any way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Ah the experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> only confirmed my conviction that there is no God, that it is people who make their life, for other people, either nice, or miserable.</sentence><sentence id="206">And anything else is just an individual need.</sentence><sentence id="207">Some people need to believe that they will go to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> after they die.</sentence><sentence id="208">I believe that I will go -- after I die, will be either co -- cremated, and that will be the end of -- because I don't believe in -- either in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>, nor in a purgatory.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Let's go back.</sentence><sentence id="214">I wanted to -- t-to bring us back to the beginning of your life.</sentence><sentence id="215">You -- You mentioned -- Why don't you just tell me what your -- your name was at birth --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Well --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: And tell me something about your original name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
