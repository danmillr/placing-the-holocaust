<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Did...how...how about during this period...can you tell us a little about your family life, your father, your mother...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: Do you remember any of your friends or...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: I remember a few, very very slim few little children of which I was one of them and uh these were friends.</sentence><sentence id="101">In fact in my in my family album there are some photos of myself and a few of my childhood friends.</sentence><sentence id="102">My mother took photos and uh so they survive in pictures to this day.</sentence><sentence id="103">But uh I can't remember a hell of a lot.</sentence><sentence id="104">It uh...what I remember wasn't... my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> life was not unpleasant.</sentence><sentence id="105">I I can't say...I1, in my memoir | pointed out that I had a...my my my mother and my father both tried as much as possible within within their human means to insulate me from the increasingly unpleasant situation for the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the Third Reich which became with, year to year, came in a descending spiral and they insulated me as much as possible and gave me a fairly normal home life and fairly decent life and so I, until 1938, things really were not too bad.</sentence><sentence id="106">I do remember quite vividly though on a number of occasions going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, still to the old <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">There were the Hitler youth, uniformed Hitler youth, and these were of course the advance, the advance guard of youthful Hilterites and they were were just only too anxious, to willing to beat up on a youngster who was not in uniform, because a youngster not in uniform of a Hitler youth or a Young Pioneer meant one of two things.</sentence><sentence id="108">Either he belonged to a family that was anti-Hitlerean (ph) and didn't want their child to be a Hitler youth, or he was a Jew or gypsy, and if they say a child who was not uniformed, he immediately was to be attacked.</sentence><sentence id="109">So I remember as much as possible of keeping clear of the Hitler youth (laughter), even seeing them a block away would usually mean that I would walk in the opposite direction and so I I managed quite well uh to keep out of their, out of their uh clutches as much as possible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: You mentioned this wasn't until 1938...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: Until 1938.</sentence><sentence id="129">By 1938 of course I no longer was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, since all Jews were out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>, and by then also, early 1938, my father died.</sentence><sentence id="130">Heart condition, very ill for his final six months and so on.</sentence><sentence id="131">Luckily he died because he never would have survived the trip to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="132">So he died and uh my mother and I then moved shortly thereafter, not immediately, shortly thereafter we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, which as things proved to be a very sensible move.</sentence><sentence id="133">Had we remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> neither she or I would have survived the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="134">By moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> we moved into a milleure (ph) that enabled her to make contact which enabled enabled her eventually to place me with a children's transport for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and enabled her as a widow eventually to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and so we both survived by probably for two reasons, moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, number one, and her incessant efforts to get us out of that.</sentence><sentence id="135">You see, my father, as I remember him, always was like many other German Jews...he felt that these these uh wild elements, these Nazi elements, would never be able to capture the whole power.</sentence><sentence id="136">They would never be able to descent to what they descended into.</sentence><sentence id="137">And so he always had this optimistic view, and he couldn't get himself to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">To him <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he had no intention of leaving.</sentence><sentence id="139">My mother would have left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1935 if he had been willing.</sentence><sentence id="140">But anyway, we remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and finally she was a widow in "38.</sentence><sentence id="141">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">Her incessant work finally enabled me to get to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with a transport of kids and she, as a widow, eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and thus she saved both our lives.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: So then in 1938 you were separated from your mother, is that when it happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: In 1938 we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">I was not separated.</sentence><sentence id="162">In 1939, in 1939 I was separated from my mother, when I was associated with this transport of children.</sentence><sentence id="163">All the children said goodbye on the <span class="DLF">train platform</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">For many, for all the children in fact, it was the last time they saw their their parents, because all these married uh folks, these married couples, they couldn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="165">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="166">Most of these children saw...for most of these kids on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, around thirty-nine children, thirty-eight of them said goodbye for the final time to their parents on that <span class="DLF">train platform</span>, taking us to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">By mother being a widow managed to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">She survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="179">Now let's go back to 1938.</sentence><sentence id="180">You moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="185">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Now...once you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>...let's, let's go over what happened there.</sentence><sentence id="189">I'm a little little unclear.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> my mother had me placed for those months...I don't know whether it was at the very beginning, but I know I was there for a number of months to the end in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, she placed me with an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span> (ph) <span class="BUILDING">Orphanage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Awerbuch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">OK.</sentence><sentence id="195">And uh</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Was it basically a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Oh it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="209">In in "38, Jews were not permitted to associate with Aryans.</sentence><sentence id="210">Oh no.</sentence><sentence id="211">That would have been abso...oh disaster for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="212">And uh so uh this was a Jewish children's home.</sentence><sentence id="213">I can't say that all the children there were orphans.</sentence><sentence id="214">I wasn't an orphan, yet I was accepted by <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span> and there were other children who had families...uh par...parents, both parents alive and they were accepted by <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">In other words, I think this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> accepted children whether they were orphans or not, because it was felt that in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> they had some kind of a refuge from what was happening on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to Jews who were being beaten and trampled on and kicked upon, and with the police looking the other way if they happened to be there.</sentence><sentence id="216">The situation by 1938 was getting out of hand.</sentence><sentence id="217">And late "38 you had this infamous Night of the Breaking Kristall (ph), Kristallnacht it was called in German, and uh that's when they really went went amuck, ran amuck, the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="218">When they attacked the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and set uh fire to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, smashed the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span>, vandalized everything they could lay their hands on, beat adults and children when whenever they found someone because by that time adults and children above the age of ten I think or twelve, I'm not sure, had to have a Jewish star so you immediately could identify who was Jewish and who wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="219">So you were living in in a terrible uh nightmare by 1938, but us being in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, around the clock, we were spared these outrages on Kristall...Kristallnight, which was right in late November...uh, not not...early November, early November 1938.</sentence><sentence id="220">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Shortly after that you were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, uh then it was 1939.</sentence><sentence id="238">Another month more passed.</sentence><sentence id="239">Months more passed, and again I was in this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span>, with lots of other kids, Jewish kids.</sentence><sentence id="240">And as I say, Nazis did not invade this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">We found ourselves sort of living like in a, like on a <span class="DLF">plantation</span>, sort of immunized from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> being a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span>, a developing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> and we were in this <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> and uh so we were there during the early months of "39.</sentence><sentence id="242">Things uh like I've read about the pa...you know, looking back upon things, things got from bad to worse and from worse to even worse and but in the <span class="BUILDING">Awerbuch home</span> things were relatively quiet and safe because we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't set foot <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for very sensible reasons.</sentence><sentence id="244">And uh finally in the summer of "39, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was formed.</sentence><sentence id="245">My mother had succeeded in getting me admitted to this transport and uh that's how I, along with thirty-eight other children, one fine summer day left on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">I should also point out that in the year 1938 to "39, my mother lived with a Jewish lady as her uh sub-tenant.</sentence><sentence id="247">In other words, she lived with a Jewish lady on Hector Strasa (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span>, un the western part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">At that time, of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was a unified <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and on <span class="BUILDING">Hector Strasa 21</span> my mother lived with a Jewish lady whose sub-tenant she was.</sentence><sentence id="249">I can't really tell you what work she did.</sentence><sentence id="250">I really can't tell you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="266">Then you were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="270">The kids went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, said goodbye to their parents on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and for all of them except one, my mother, was the last time they saw their parents, because they all died in the Holocaust, these these parents.</sentence><sentence id="271">Children left for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and then we arrived in a</sentence><sentence id="273"><span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> (ph) , maybe fifteen to twenty miles southeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, where a French nobleman, Count formed a uh <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> for us thirty-nine children.</sentence><sentence id="274">He had previously formed a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for probably an equivalent number of Spanish girls from <span class="REGION">Republican Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">Spanish Republican refugee girls were also quartered, not in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but in a near-by <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, also one of "s charitable enterprises.</sentence><sentence id="276">And so this is where we lived and it seemed at the time that this was our refuge, our <span class="DLF">port</span> in a developing storm.</sentence><sentence id="277">Of course, like history tells us, things didn't remain so quiet and the <span class="DLF">port</span> in the storm wasn't a <span class="DLF">port</span> for very long.</sentence><sentence id="278">For for less than a year it was a <span class="DLF">port</span> uh a <span class="DLF">port</span> ina storm.</sentence><sentence id="279">While I was at uh this this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Monsieur in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span>, just a few weeks later I got a letter suddenly from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">I didn't know a soul in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">I, but I recognized the handwriting.</sentence><sentence id="282">A letter from my mother.</sentence><sentence id="283">She told me she had arrived in in in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and and was working for a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leatherhead</span> (ph) in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and and so I knew at that point that she was out, I was out and things looked pretty good at the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your life in this <span class="NPIP">French place</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Well, was...we were all Jewish children, but it wasn't a Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="304">Uh our counselors and teachers were not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="305">Our benefactor wasn't Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="306">Uh we were not...we had no kosher cuisine.</sentence><sentence id="307">We had no Jewish rules and regulations.</sentence><sentence id="308">There was no Jewish instruction or anything.</sentence><sentence id="309">We led a uh totally non-Jewish assimilationist (ph) type of life.</sentence><sentence id="310">Uh and I, like I state in my memoir, my guess is that most of the kids in the transport to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> came from assimilationist uh German-Jewish homes.</sentence><sentence id="311">There were no religious people that I can remember there among the kids.</sentence><sentence id="312">We all seemed to take to this secular type of life at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span> rather easily.</sentence><sentence id="313">We seemed to fit in very very nicely.</sentence><sentence id="314">I should also mention in in retrospect that my own parents did not have a very uh...did not run a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">My father came from very deeply religious parents, but he himself did not follow a deeply religi...religious life although he did go to <span class="BUILDING">schule</span> (ph) on the religious holidays and participated in the services.</sentence><sentence id="316">My mother not at all, and so I remember not living in a in a really Jewish type of <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">We were living a assimilationist type of <span class="BUILDING">secular home</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: What activities did you have there?</sentence><sentence id="334">Did you have <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>?</sentence><sentence id="335">Did you...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Now we we are back again now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cassie</span>...our activities were...we had uh French class.</sentence><sentence id="340">We learned French.</sentence><sentence id="341">I remember very well one of our teachers was a White Russian who pounded us (laughter)...verbs and syntax.</sentence><sentence id="342">I remember very well... Madame Richter, R - 1- C -H-T-E-R, a Russian uh emigre from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span> for all I know.</sentence><sentence id="343">Maybe even a member of the uh <span class="BUILDING">royal courts</span> for all I know.</sentence><sentence id="344">Uh anyway uh maybe an instructress to some of the uh Russian uh noblemen, one-time noblemen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span>, and uh anyway Madame Richter, she really pounded French into us.</sentence><sentence id="345">I remember that to this to this day and uh we had other French teachers and uh emigre teachers and uh...how shall I put it...uh teachers and uh counselors...that's the word I'm looking for, counselors...and none of them Jewish and so, as I say, it was a secular atmosphere and we played and we had our instruction.</sentence><sentence id="346">We had our three meals a day.</sentence><sentence id="347">If there was anything lacking it was parental love.</sentence><sentence id="348">That that was missing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
