<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: How?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: How?</sentence><sentence id="256">I knew the captain, and by then we had -- I don't know if you read it or -- we had exemption for my father and his whole family for the Jewish laws.</sentence><sentence id="257">And I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> but not as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="258">Exempt and with different armband, and I was in very good friendship with the captain.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I said to the captain, "Goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="260">I'm not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>."</sentence><sentence id="261">And I was stepping down to the left.</sentence><sentence id="262">And that's when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span>,?</sentence><sentence id="263">who I didn't know it exist, to the Swedish legation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: How did that happen?</sentence><sentence id="274">How did you come into contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
