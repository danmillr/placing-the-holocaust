<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Can you explain that?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: And I was there all during the war.</sentence><sentence id="120">I was with a group of young people, we wer -- we survived the war intact.</sentence><sentence id="121">Not one of us got taken and it was due to the leader of the pack.</sentence><sentence id="122">That was Manfred Greenback, who is still alive and who is still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and -- and who is actually getting a pension from the Dutch government for the work he and his sister, both -- she also s -- also has a kind of a small pension from the Dutch government, for the work that they did during the war.</sentence><sentence id="123">But, as a -- I was in that group with hi -- with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: But this was a -- this was illegal work that he did at the time, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: This was -- during the war, it was underground work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: In the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">But he definitely -- he and his sister both, definitely saved us.</sentence><sentence id="137">With the -- through their organization, their ability to get the various papers that you needed to survive and to get food stamps and -- and their connections with other groups.</sentence><sentence id="138">And it was like a large <span class="DLF">spider web</span> of -- of underground activity.</sentence><sentence id="139">They were all connected, one way or the other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work might have been very different from each other.</sentence><sentence id="140">During the war, they all worked together.</sentence><sentence id="141">And anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia Gasco.</sentence><sentence id="142">It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Stutz-Hober</span>, the big <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> in -- in amst -- the state ballet.</sentence><sentence id="143">It was then called the</sentence><sentence id="145">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 6 Ballet 1945, when -- when I was in it.</sentence><sentence id="146">That was the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="147">And Madame Gasco, who -- who started it, started organizing this last month before the war was ended.</sentence><sentence id="148">We -- we already knew, you know, that the war was going to end and we started practicing and -- and -- and rehearsing and doing all these things.</sentence><sentence id="149">And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time the war was -- was actually ended.</sentence><sentence id="150">And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet and I had various other jobs.</sentence><sentence id="151">I also did photography.</sentence><sentence id="152">I studied photography with a friend of my mother's, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my head, even though I didn't even know it.</sentence><sentence id="153">But she had sort of protected me from various things that went on during the war.</sentence><sentence id="154">So it's all very complicated, but -- but it -- that's how it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Ca-Can you give me an example?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Well, during the war, I was -- I was dancing.</sentence><sentence id="180">| -- I -- I think I tell all that on the -- on the other tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: You tell -- oh, yeah, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: No, I just meant about the way this woman was -- was protecting you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Well, that's right, she was protecting me in the sense that they decided that some of the things I was during -- doing during the war, was endangering myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="198"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0019 7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: And she saw to it that I had to stop doing them.</sentence><sentence id="200">She never talked to me, but she talked to the people who I'm do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="201">And so in that sense, I didn't know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this.</sentence><sentence id="202">It was very interesting.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="203">So, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it and they took care of me.</sentence><sentence id="204">So, even though I didn't know it.</sentence><sentence id="205">But anyway -- so, after the war, I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying, "Well, what happened to your family?</sentence><sentence id="206">What happened?"</sentence><sentence id="207">You know, and these were people all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="208">I mean <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- you know, was <span class="REGION">North America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209"><span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, every -- letters came from all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="210">And I went back to our old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, which was the place they all wrote to.</sentence><sentence id="211">And I told the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail.</sentence><sentence id="212">When I saw them all -- all these letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these peop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine.</sentence><sentence id="213">And some of them I didn't remember and some of them I did.</sentence><sentence id="214">And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky's family, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had two daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky.</sentence><sentence id="215">And we had <span class="BUILDING">gymnastics</span> with them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and they had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">And he had to study again, he got a degree in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">And he was a psychiatrist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren't going so well in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, he decided to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">He went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with his family and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 8 he had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in psychiatry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">And that's where he was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">So when I got their letter, I wrote.</sentence><sentence id="225">And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">I think it's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">It's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallem</span> or wherever it is.</sentence><sentence id="228">It's in -- near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">And so h-he decided he was going to go via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, from -- from the in -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">So he came by and he said, "Come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">Come -- we take care of it, come."</sentence><sentence id="232">You know?</sentence><sentence id="233">Well, I was doing very well at that time and I kept saying, "No, I -- I can't make up my mind."</sentence><sentence id="234">He kept saying, "Look, your parents aren't going to come back and --" as I'm telling on the other tape, I kept thinking, "Yes, maybe they will come back, and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="235">Somebody will show up, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can't come right away."</sentence><sentence id="236">So I postponed and postponed.</sentence><sentence id="237">Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and say, "Come, come, come."</sentence><sentence id="238">And he sent me an affidavit.</sentence><sentence id="239">And I got a call from the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> and they were saying, "Well, do you want to come, or don't you want to come?</sentence><sentence id="240">You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what's going on there?"</sentence><sentence id="241">And so I took a deep breath and I went.</sentence><sentence id="242">It was terribly hard.</sentence><sentence id="243">I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the ballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave.</sentence><sentence id="244">But on the other hand, I really -- I didn't see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my parents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family.</sentence><sentence id="245">I had a lot of family still, my mother's family there.</sentence><sentence id="246">And even a cousin of my father's, Heinz</sentence></p><p><sentence id="249">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 9 Kemfer was still there and -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">And -- but it wasn't really my own, you know?</sentence><sentence id="251">It wasn't close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="252">And it doesn't have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself.</sentence><sentence id="253">You know, I mean, after all, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn't like it, you know, I could come back and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: And what was your immediate plan?</sentence><sentence id="255">What would you be going when you got here?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Well, that -- tha -- I didn't even think about that because he's -- well, I thought I was going to dance, actually.</sentence><sentence id="257">Yes, I thought I was going to dance.</sentence><sentence id="258">Well, it turned out that they lived on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I -- I'm having trouble remembering the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">I know that the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babylon</span>, I think.</sentence><sentence id="261">I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babylon</span>, but I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="262">The second <span class="NPIP">place</span> they lived was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brightwaters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">They moved pretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brightwaters</span> and that's -- you know, it is a ways from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">It -- you have to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Long Island railroad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">And as I found out pretty soon, you know, it was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="266">I had to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for the dance -- for my classes at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing right.</sentence><sentence id="267">I could never date, because I -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came -- you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- I had to take a certain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back.</sentence><sentence id="268">And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> if you wanted to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="269">And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at the balle -- in the ballet class, at the American School of Ballet.</sentence><sentence id="270">And she was born and raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich Village</span> and her mother had a spare <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">And so she and I moved in together to -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich Village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean,</sentence><sentence id="274">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0019 10 she was -- she knew every little corner of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich Village</span>, having been raised there.</sentence><sentence id="275">And she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together.</sentence><sentence id="276">We finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then.</sentence><sentence id="277">And we lived there together and where we lived was on <span class="DLF">Third Street</span>, where now is the library of <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">law library</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">uni</span> -- and at the time, they were already trying to empty the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, people whose lease had run out and they weren't replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, but they had to go to the end of people's contract.</sentence><sentence id="278">And -- and her mother's contract was very long.</sentence><sentence id="279">So we were just -- there were a few people left in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, so it was -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping up on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bums</span> and -- and hobos and whatever you have there.</sentence><sentence id="280">And it was quite an exciting time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich Village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">It was still a little bit of the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenwich Village</span>, you know, that you -- that you hear about.</sentence><sentence id="282">Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a small <span class="BUILDING">Italian restaurant</span>, that was where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="283">He -- he would keep message and get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could make calls there.</sentence><sentence id="284">And many, many a time.</sentence><sentence id="285">So -- but it was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="286">I mean, it was exciting, scary and nice.</sentence><sentence id="287">I had to learn how to ride those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">I mean, I came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, after the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very fancy -- I had taken my mother's -- I had some of my mother's clothes in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I had them remade for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">Well I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I looked like a spook, compared to the other people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">It was -- there was something going on</sentence><sentence id="292"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0019 11 called the new look.</sentence><sentence id="293">Remember, they wore these -- these very -- these skirts with many tuffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on the <span class="DLF">borders</span> and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked weird, highly weird.</sentence><sentence id="294">So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, went to <span class="BUILDING">Macy's</span> and she got me outfitted.</sentence><sentence id="295">I got a
