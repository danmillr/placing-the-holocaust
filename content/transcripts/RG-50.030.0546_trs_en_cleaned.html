<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: And if we go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, we would have a better opportunity to

one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment unit</span> with several families.</sentence><sentence id="118">And I remember that was a little difficult.</sentence><sentence id="119">And my mother's father,

knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they said the Jews are being collected in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">And my aunt, younger aunt, her name is also Ibby(ph), my mother's younger sister was there, and my grandmother, whose name was Sarah Roth, and she says, Eva, you are not -- she didn't call me Eva, she called me Havelah(ph) -- Havelah(ph), you are not listed on the list, you go and hide.</sentence><sentence id="134">And when it gets dark, you will go to the <span class="BUILDING">rabbi's house</span>, and they will send a

kept the keys, I remember her locking up and pointing where she is putting the key.</sentence><sentence id="138">And I was ready to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> when a group of Gypsies appeared.</sentence><sentence id="139">And I pretended that my grandmother was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, because they had s -- they were telling stories

id="142">Grandma, Grandma, the Gypsies, don't leave me alone.</sentence><sentence id="143">Naturally, everything is in Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="144">And the Gypsies kind of stayed there on.</sentence><sentence id="145">And I said, just leave me alone, my grandma will come out and she will be very angry at you.</sentence><sentence id="146">And they left.</sentence><sentence
