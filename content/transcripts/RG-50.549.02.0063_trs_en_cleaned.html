Constitution protects every cit-citizen.</sentence><sentence id="281">S -- but in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, although the Jewish people lived there over a thousand years, as a matter of fact, there's -- in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wodzislaw</span>, there's a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which was over a thousand years old.</sentence><sentence id="282">But during the war years, it was -- made a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> out of it, the Germans, you know, kept horses there, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="283">And everything was destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="284">As a matter of fact, I was told it's being rebuilt now, they want to attract tourism, and so on, different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="285">The -- the Polish people in particular are very, very anti-Semitic, and I -- and how can I -- I can explain it is, my own family and I had an experience, although we were very respected citizens.</sentence><sentence id="286">When the Germans came in, the first day they came in, they knocked at every -- they were shooting in front of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and there were a lot of screaming, and s -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="287">We were -- we were hiding in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that we owned.</sentence><sentence id="288">And finally they came to our <span class="DLF">door</span>, they were <span class="DLF">steel doors</span>, they were banging and shooting, and -- and calling in German, "Get out, you [indecipherable] get out."</sentence><sentence id="289">You know, and eventually we had to get out.</sentence><sentence id="290">They were beating us, and we had to run to a square.</sentence><sentence id="291">And then, they shot several people, put some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on fire.</sentence><sentence id="292">So people didn't come out, they put them on fire.</sentence><sentence id="293">And we are all this -- on that square they [indecipherable] on us, several -- maybe it's couple thousand, or several thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="294">Then they left.</sentence><sentence id="295">So once they left, my parents felt th-these were the first ones coming in, they were -- had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, you know, that we heard.</sentence><sentence id="298">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0063 11 So what -- my parents said, "Let's go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, there's a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> nearby."</sentence><sentence id="299">And we were there only minutes, I don't know, less than a half hour.</sentence><sentence id="300">The priest himself, in charge, he said, "You Belfers, you zhid -- you Jews," you know, "get out."</sentence><sentence id="301">And actually pushed us out, you know.</sentence><sentence id="302">Said, [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="303">So we ran to -- we had an uncle, you know, who lived <span class="NPIP">outside</span> -- a little far out -- outs -- outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">We stayed there for overnight, a couple nights, I don't remember, a few days, you know.</sentence><sentence id="305">I t calmed down, so we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">We got -- we got no help, really, to speak of.</sentence><sentence id="307">Not only that, I know of cases who were -- some people that I knew were hiding in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, but if a neighbor would know, or found out, that they being hidden, they would report them, you know?</sentence><sentence id="308">And the people, not only the Jewish people got either shot, or sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, or whatever, but also the Gentile.</sentence><sentence id="309">But there was no -- there were -- the Germans got only cooperation from everyone.</sentence><sentence id="310">The church leaders in particular, and it was a bad, bad time, and I can't explain it even nowadays, why there should be such hate in a -- in some people's mind towards the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="311">The Jewish people have contributed a lot, not only in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, everywh -- everywhere they lived, in -- in many <span class="DLF">fields</span>, whether it's medicine, or whether it's engineering, or -- or -- or so many other important <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">But obviously it goes back so many years, it goes back to -- it goes back to a thousand years, claiming that things that we did to Christ, which is a lie, and even the ner -- the -- the New Testament is not very accurate.</sentence><sentence id="313">Even the Pope recently stated that.</sentence><sentence id="314">And as far as Jesus, he was a Jew, he died as a Jew, and he was not killed by</sentence><sentence id="316"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0063 12 the Jewish people, he was killed by the Romans.</sentence><sentence id="317">He may have -- may have -- he may have wanted to do some reforming, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="318">But why they -- why -- it's 2,000 years later, why is this being taught, or when -- or when -- that's why there's that hate builds up, from childhood.</sentence><sentence id="319">They go to <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, they're [indecipherable] Jews, or other references to Jew, although it has been removed now from the liturgy, I -- I hope that futu -- future generations will not ever have to experience difficulties and obstructions in -- of justice and everything, because they have one religion, or another religion.</sentence><sentence id="320">I don't -- I don't believe one religion's better than the other, they're all the same, they all teach you to be a better person.</sentence><sentence id="321">They don't teach you to hate.</sentence><sentence id="322">And that's -- that's my message, in a way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
