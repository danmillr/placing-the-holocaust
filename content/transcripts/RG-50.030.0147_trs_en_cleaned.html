<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q:Now, we'd like you to tell us your name and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A:My name is Emanuel Mandel.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> in the country of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> in 1936.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q:1936.</sentence><sentence id="8">And you've said that where you were born is not really important to the story, so would you describe your family and perhaps your earliest memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A:I said that it is not important to my story because uh there was an old adage that said you must be born where your mother is, and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> at the time because my father had a position in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">As a matter of fact, he was about to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and they were just waiting for me to arrive, and when I was, I'm told, perhaps three months old or so, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> and never to return.</sentence><sentence id="13">I've never been there since.</sentence><sentence id="14">I would say that my earliest recollections are probably three or four years later.</sentence><sentence id="15">Uh, and none of them are in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">They are later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> further.</sentence><sentence id="17">As we moved, as the war came, other recollections come up in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q:Well, let's start at your earliest recollections, and describe your family.</sentence><sentence id="26">What, who, who made up your family and where did you live?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A:My family consisted at the time of, a small family, I'm an only child.</sentence><sentence id="30">Uh, my parents had a son before I was born, some three years before, who was born healthy according to the pediatrics of the time and at the age of ten weeks died, probably from some problem that in this day</sentence><sentence id="32">and age could have been handled uh very simply in any <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">But that was 1933 and even though they were in major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> with major medical knowledge available, it could not save the child.</sentence><sentence id="34">I came in 1936 and I was the only child to my mother and father.</sentence><sentence id="35">Uh, to, to flesh out in a sense the information about them, my father is alive and well, lives in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city of Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">He is 85, just turned 85 this year.</sentence><sentence id="37">My mother died uh in 1967 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> of causes unrelated to anything else.</sentence><sentence id="38">It was a disease and uh, she died quickly, at a rather young age, just under 60.</sentence><sentence id="39">I, uh, as I say, since I have no siblings, the family is kind of limited.</sentence><sentence id="40">If I were to give you background about the family itself, uh my father comes from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, which was, at the time that he was born in 1904, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, maybe <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span>, or maybe even <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, because the way the <span class="DLF">borders</span> were moved at the time nobody really knew.</sentence><sentence id="41">His passport was Czech.</sentence><sentence id="42">His citizenship was Czech.</sentence><sentence id="43">The part of the <span class="REGION">land</span> was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austro-Hungary</span>, and his language is Hungarian, so it is difficult to determine.</sentence><sentence id="44">Legally, he was Czech.</sentence><sentence id="45">He served in the Czech Army and when he was 19 or 20 years old.</sentence><sentence id="46">But he never identified as a Czech.</sentence><sentence id="47">There's a document that I gave a copy of a little while ago, which is a Czech passport, which was, uh the pictures in the document are probably from 1939, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="48">I'm a young child but I'm still a Czech citizen on my father's papers.</sentence><sentence id="49">My father was raised in that general <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> which is in...east of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>--in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ruthenia</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="50">Today it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span>, as a matter of fact; so it's moved again.</sentence><sentence id="51">But he was raised there; and his travels took him to many <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but maybe you'll want to come back to that.</sentence><sentence id="52">My mother is from another part of the Austro-Hungary empire, that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which was really Yugoslav.</sentence><sentence id="53">She's from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="REGION">southern Hungary</span> which today is <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">And just to indicate the confusion, it had three names - one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serb</span>, one in Hungarian, and one in German.</sentence><sentence id="55">And people wouldn't know how to refer to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities--</span>whether you called them <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ujvidek</span> in Hungarian, or Neusatz in German, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serb</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">She was raised there, in a family of uh six children, three boys and three</sentence><sentence id="58">girls, and my father met her in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and again we may want to come to his story, at least parts of it, as you want to pursue that.</sentence><sentence id="59">But . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q:Why don't you tell it to us?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="96">Azl'd be glad to.</sentence><sentence id="97">Well, uh, my father was educated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and eventually took a position in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> where my mother lived, met her and they married and from there they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> to another position my father had, and that's why I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">From there he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which was something he wanted to do all his life, but the pattern of migration at that time was by choice, well, semi-choice.</sentence><sentence id="99">He wanted to do this because he was trying to get to a certain particular position in his life, but he also was constrained from getting to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> until 1940, uh, 1936, because as a Czech citizen, we go back to the old Czech citizenship, he could get no, he could not receive working papers or whatever permission to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, as a Czech citizen.</sentence><sentence id="100">In "36 he received it, so he went from part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, after all these various detours, in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">If that's confusing, I can understand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: What was his <span class="NPIP">position</span>?</sentence><sentence id="109">What was his <span class="BUILDING">work</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A:My father was a cantor.</sentence><sentence id="113">My father was a cantor in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and has been that all his life.</sentence><sentence id="114">And he had positions in major <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novi Sad</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">And later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">And in order to be able to move in his own <span class="DLF">field</span>, he had certain <span class="NPIP">positions</span> that he wanted to reach.</sentence><sentence id="117">And a cantor in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that held 3500 seats with a choir of 40 people, was a major position, and he wanted that position.</sentence><sentence id="118">But he didn't have permission to go there until</sentence><sentence id="120">"36.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q:Why not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A:He was a Czech citizen.</sentence><sentence id="135">And the Czech citizens were not given Hungarian working papers.</sentence><sentence id="136">So the pattern of migration was not because he was either a Jew or because he, the war came.</sentence><sentence id="137">This was before that.</sentence><sentence id="138">There may have been some overtones of that, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="139">But very legally he was not permitted to get papers until "36 at which point he did assume the position of being one of the chief cantors of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, which was a major Jewish community center in <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q:Are you aware of any changes in your family's life when Hitler came to power?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Well, "Hitler came to power" needs to be addressed in terms of when - whether when he came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or as his power began to reach out throughout Europe.</sentence><sentence id="149">And what time are you talking about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q:Whenever it affected you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A:Sure.</sentence><sentence id="155">Hitler comes to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the laws, the various laws that are passed, the uh... I think there's a term called "Numerus Clausus."</sentence><sentence id="156">These various enumerated clauses that were passed to restrict certain life began way back probably in 1933.</sentence><sentence id="157">And they came, as history indicates, it's not germane to my particular story - it's available in lots of papers - that most of what happened was very legal, very correct, and did everything according to the rules.</sentence><sentence id="158">Now, if you want recollections from me for example, I know that uh one day, this was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>,</sentence><sentence id="160">in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, the capital of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, in a very lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, on the fifth floor of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I had lived which I recall quite clearly.</sentence><sentence id="161">As a matter of fact, for the first time in forty some years I visited it last year.</sentence><sentence id="162">My wife and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">Didn't go in because I didn't want to bother the people and there was nobody <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">So the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is now probably 80 or 90 years old - it's in reasonable shape.</sentence><sentence id="165">But in 1940 or so, 1938, it was a very lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I remember that one day, I can't tell you which year, but some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in that general period, in "39, "40, "41, a telephone installer came in and said that he must take the telephone away.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I remember asking why, whether I asked him or my parents I don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="168">He said Jews may not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephones</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">Period.</sentence><sentence id="170">Another incident.</sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, we had a maid, a live-in-maid - there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's quarters</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, that was very usual in those days, in those circumstances, and uh, she was told she could no longer be with us.</sentence><sentence id="172">She wanted to take me with her to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">My parents thought about it, chose not to do that.</sentence><sentence id="174">But maids could not be employed by Jews.</sentence><sentence id="175">So the maid left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q:Why would she have taken you to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A:Well, she thought she would in some way help me.</sentence><sentence id="203">Or maybe save me, or maybe protect me, or maybe help me, or raise me in a sense, because there were overtones of problems.</sentence><sentence id="204">Uh, I recall rather clearly that as a child of 5 or 6 or so I wanted a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">Not an unusual request, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for a child of 5 or 6.</sentence><sentence id="206">My parents were certainly in a position to afford a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> or five.</sentence><sentence id="207">But there was major concern.</sentence><sentence id="208">I didn't understand the concern at the time.</sentence><sentence id="209">I just understood I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And I probably threw the normal 5-year-old-tantrums about it.</sentence><sentence id="211">Later on I kind of understood that one of the reasons was that in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, you ride <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> in a <span class="DLF">park</span>, and in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, large, urbane, sophisticated as it was, if a child with a</sentence><sentence id="213">yellow star on his chest rode a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, somebody might have knocked him off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, taken the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and left him on the <span class="DLF">curb</span>, and nobody really would have said too much.</sentence><sentence id="214">And my parents thought it was just unsafe.</sentence><sentence id="215">Not unsafe in terms of the kinds of problems you might have because of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span>, but just unsafe.</sentence><sentence id="216">I know that when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we had was on a corer of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - you could see down the <span class="DLF">street</span> if you stood in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, there was a circular kind of a set of <span class="DLF">windows</span> - and the <span class="DLF">street</span> I lived on, my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was number at 13, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was at number 44.</sentence><sentence id="217">You could see from the fifth floor <span class="DLF">apartment window</span> at number 13 to number 44.</sentence><sentence id="218">You could almost see the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was down the <span class="DLF">street</span> several blocks.</sentence><sentence id="219">And I didn't know this but I was told that my father, for example, often would both watch me walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and sometimes follow me walking to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because of some safety concerns that the kid might be knocked into traffic.</sentence><sentence id="220">Nobody would have necessarily said too much if a child age six or seven with a yellow star would be pushed into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">Accidentally or deliberately by somebody who was trying to make an incident.</sentence><sentence id="222">These are certainly things that in some way affected my life as a child, and uh, hindsight is always perfect.</sentence><sentence id="223">Part of what I find fascinating in my own case is that I have very good recollections.</sentence><sentence id="224">But the time that this took place I didn't have the emotional impact of what this meant.</sentence><sentence id="225">I learned that later.</sentence><sentence id="226">A six year old doesn't understand political realities, doesn't understand various kinds of anti- this or anti- that.</sentence><sentence id="227">Uh, to a 6 year old, in a rather peculiar way, wearing a yellow star makes him an adult."</sentence><sentence id="228">All the adults do. "</sentence><sentence id="229">Well, if they do and I don't, I'm a child.</sentence><sentence id="230">If they do and I do, I'm an adult."</sentence><sentence id="231">There's a certain badge of honor.</sentence><sentence id="232">They didn't understand the negative implications of that.</sentence><sentence id="233">To me, to be like an adult, I too have my own yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="234">It was an important achievement, of sorts.</sentence><sentence id="235">That sounds silly.</sentence><sentence id="236">But we are talking about a 6-year old child."</sentence><sentence id="237">The yellow star was introduced in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> on March 29, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="238">Mr. Mandel was wearing the star when he was 8 years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q:Do you remember when you got your yellow star?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A:The specific day, no.</sentence><sentence id="289">But it must have been some time in uh ... Well, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was in a peculiar position.</sentence><sentence id="290"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, being an ally of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was not overrun.</sentence><sentence id="291">I am reasonably certain that the reason I'm alive today is because I was not under German rule in 1939.</sentence><sentence id="292">Now, the Hungarian Nazi Party, known as the Arrow Cross, was not what I would call benevolent.</sentence><sentence id="293">On the other hand... Shall we stop?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q:We're going to have to stop.</sentence><sentence id="301">I'm sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A:I didn't want to pay attention to the flicker; but I figured when it went out, might as well stop.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q:Let's do this as quickly as we can.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A:Anything you want to say while we're off for a minute in terms of where we are?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q:This is very interesting and important and exactly what we want to have on the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A:Well, is this the way you want to have it?</sentence><sentence id="313">I have another variation, another canned speech, although some of it is.</sentence><sentence id="314">I mean, I've done this before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q:...breathing in my ear to tell you that she's terrific.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A:Well, I know that.</sentence><sentence id="321">Come on!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q:Go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A:I was commenting on the fact that one of the--if you want to call it an advantage, or one of the blessings in disguise--was that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was not occupied by the Germans until fairly late in the war.</sentence><sentence id="333"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was an ally.</sentence><sentence id="334">Again, historians know that the region of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was uh, struck some kind of ally pact with Hitler and they were allies, so Hungarian troops on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="335">As a consequence, the German presence, the physical presence of the Germans, specifically the SS and the Gestapo, did not enter <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> until very late in the war.</sentence><sentence id="336">Literally until 1944.</sentence><sentence id="337">Earlier, the regime was run by the Hungarian Nazi Party--the so- called "Arrow Cross," the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Nylas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="338">And their symbol was crossed arrows, as opposed to the swastika that the Germans had.</sentence><sentence id="339">And as a consequence, the kind of life that one had was probably different.</sentence><sentence id="340">I'm not sure it was any better; but life was certainly different than it would have been under German occupation.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1552">A: Interaction with other inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did not exist.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I mean, in a sense--I don't know if I could ever prove this--but if you approached the <span class="DLF">fence</span> too close, I'm not certain that... 1 would expect the orders were to shoot, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">turrets</span> that were guarding.</sentence><sentence id="1554">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1555">Nobody ever was shot, because people knew.</sentence><sentence id="1556">But there was no contact.</sentence><sentence id="1557">The other reason there was no contact is my recollection is that the group right next to us, with whom you could have shouted across the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, was a group from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>; and there was no common language of communication.</sentence><sentence id="1558">Hungarians may have spoken French and German, but probably not Polish-- at least not most of them.</sentence><sentence id="1559">I certainly didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1560">So typically what kids would have done is talk to</sentence><sentence id="1562">0 each other.</sentence><sentence id="1563">If there had been kids there, I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1564">But I don't have any recollection of any kids around.</sentence><sentence id="1565">Our particular quadrant in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, our <span class="REGION">section</span>, in the back there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, if you faced the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1566">On the left were this Polish group.</sentence><sentence id="1567">On the right, I think was vacant.</sentence><sentence id="1568">And the front was right off the main <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1569">So really, we were not surrounded by people.</sentence><sentence id="1570">Our contact with the outside world--and I don't know what contact there may have been by adults, who had the communication ability by some communication with the German command.</sentence><sentence id="1571">Although I think it was quite limited; because nobody knew where, you know, what was going on, precisely where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1572">Except, they had a sense.</sentence><sentence id="1573">I mean, people had traveled around Europe knew that you go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in a certain direction for three and a half days, you're going to wind up in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> north of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1574">I mean, that's easy enough.</sentence><sentence id="1575">Remember, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> did not exist.</sentence><sentence id="1576">It's near a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arendenheim</span> (ph), or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1577">I mean, there's no such <span class="NPIP">place</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="1578"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> that nobody ever paid attention to, until it became <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1579">Nobody would know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_wi_cim</span>--or something of that nature in Polish--where that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="1580">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1581">So contact with others in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was really nil.</sentence><sentence id="1582">With the wardens, with the <span class="BUILDING">jailers</span>, there was a different contact.</sentence><sentence id="1583">I remember leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> several times while we were there to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1584">Now, we talk about showers; we have to remember what showers represented.</sentence><sentence id="1585">I certainly didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1586">But I wonder how many adults knew that when you enter <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, one of two things can happen.</sentence><sentence id="1587">Water or gas.</sentence><sentence id="1588">Because the major way of extermination was the Zyklon [B] gas that came out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower pods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1589">Shower heads.</sentence><sentence id="1590">Again, in our case, that was not the situation.</sentence><sentence id="1591">We were given certain sanitary privileges, because the only place you had hot water was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1592">I mean, not inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1593">It's cold, and they didn't want to bury the <span class="DLF">pipes</span> deep enough so they wouldn't freeze.</sentence><sentence id="1594">Cold water we had, I think, with some arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="1595">No hot water.</sentence><sentence id="1596">So uh we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> at various intervals.</sentence><sentence id="1597">I don't recall exactly when, but any number of times.</sentence><sentence id="1598">That's</sentence><sentence id="1600">1 the only time that we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1601">The only time others left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1602">And I'm sure some people did who were taken into the <span class="BUILDING">base hospital</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">camp hospital</span>, and they came back.</sentence><sentence id="1603">And the other contact was when people went out to bring in the food.</sentence><sentence id="1604">Our people, as it happens, were kind of katty-corner, maybe a hundred yards from one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">camp kitchens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And the food was brought in in these large like 50-gallon <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1606">Because everything that we got was some kind of liquid.</sentence><sentence id="1607">Some bread and some kind of soup- like thing and some kind of coffee-like thing.</sentence><sentence id="1608">My only recollections of food that were brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were a type of soup, with whatever floated in it, a type of coffee, a type of, and bread.</sentence><sentence id="1609">Water was, you know, water was available.</sentence><sentence id="1610">And people were let out under guard to go across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, uh, people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and to...I don't know, a dozen people, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1611">Whatever it took to carry these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vats</span>, and to bring to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and put in certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>; and people would line up, and this would be served by our people.</sentence><sentence id="1612">Under the supervision of the German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1613">Beyond that, the only contact was with the German troopers who would come to inspect, as I said, every day.</sentence><sentence id="1614">Initially, we were told to line up at four o'clock in the morning, regardless of weather and regardless of what time they came.</sentence><sentence id="1615">I remember there were, I remember, two...whatever their rank was, I don't what.</sentence><sentence id="1616">Two folks who were in charge of the detail that would come.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And I remember both of these in the winter; because I guess earlier I just, it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="1618">We would be out there, and by this time the shoes that I described before that had been repaired, had not yet been repaired, maybe hadn't fallen apart yet.</sentence><sentence id="1619">And here comes, through the <span class="DLF">camp gate</span>, this small <span class="DLF">line</span> of several soldiers and several officer types with their black shiny boots up to their knees without a fleck on them.</sentence><sentence id="1620">I think somebody was running behind them and cleaning the boots as they walked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1621">And one was a great big, tall, unpleasant-looking fellow, and he was the one who said four o'clock every morning, and when they asked him, well, couldn't you give us an idea as when you might be by, based on your sequence, we would be out a</sentence><sentence id="1623">2 half-hour before.</sentence><sentence id="1624">He says, four o'clock every morning.</sentence><sentence id="1625">I'm boss and you're nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1626">He didn't realize he was boss over nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1627">He was then replaced.</sentence><sentence id="1628">Not because of our concern.</sentence><sentence id="1629">He was rotated on a different <span class="NPIP">job</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1630">And next comes a short guy.</sentence><sentence id="1631">I just remember he was a short guy.</sentence><sentence id="1632">Also shiny boots, and he met with whatever the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> our group leadership was, and they made an agreement that said, look, I will be out every morning, let's say at eight o'clock, or whatever the time was.</sentence><sentence id="1633">I don't care when you gather, but when I come to that <span class="DLF">gate</span>, you folks be out there.</sentence><sentence id="1634">You can be there a minute before, two days before, but when I get there, you be there.</sentence><sentence id="1635">We thought that was a major human, or humane kind of an act.</sentence><sentence id="1636">He did say that if every he comes and we're not ready - four o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1637">It worked.</sentence><sentence id="1638">I don't know how long.</sentence><sentence id="1639">I mean those kinds of, the sense of what a week was or a month was is difficult for me to reflect on.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And one day as he was walking by, he saw a young woman standing and her feet were literally out of her shoes because they'd disintegrated.</sentence><sentence id="1641">I mean the kind of decent city shoes were not made for the mud of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1642">And after several weeks, they just wouldn't last very long.</sentence><sentence id="1643">And he took a notice of it.</sentence><sentence id="1644">Uh, the next day or the day after or whatever, as he came by, his assistant had a pair of shoes for the woman.</sentence><sentence id="1645">Unfortunately, they were about eight sizes too small.</sentence><sentence id="1646">I mean, I don't know eight sizes, but you know feet tend to swell when they're in, or maybe they had a little frostbite or whatnot, and they were too small.</sentence><sentence id="1647">I think they made some arrangement and the shoes were enlarged, because we had a cobbler, but there's a certain sense of humanity even under those circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="1648">And a sense of comedy as well.</sentence><sentence id="1649">But order.</sentence><sentence id="1650">As he came by to check, as he came by to check the people, standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, those who were unable to come <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, that were sick and what not, were permitted to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1651">And some other officer, sergeant-type, would walk down the <span class="DLF">barrack doors</span> and check those.</sentence><sentence id="1652">Well, some of these camp guards really didn't come from the elite of the German Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="1653">They were locals in sense.</sentence><sentence id="1654">In uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1655">And we dubbed one of them "Popeye," because he smoked a pipe and he had kind of a jut jaw, and was</sentence><sentence id="1657">3 Popeye.</sentence><sentence id="1658">Popeye sometimes would skip walking through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1659">When he discovered there was somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> who spoke German, all he would do is shout <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, "Alles in ordnung?"</sentence><sentence id="1660">And if the response was, "Alles in ordnung," he'd go on.</sentence><sentence id="1661">As long as order was maintained, he was happy.</sentence><sentence id="1662">And, they, a piece of comic relief if you will.</sentence><sentence id="1663">I know this on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> because when I had pneumonia, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, and I heard this.</sentence><sentence id="1664">And one of the people whose name I don't remember, she was a grandmother- type but of course to an eight-year old, anybody over 20 is a grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="1665">She was the one who was in charge of the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1666">Uh, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were elongated, long things sectioned.</sentence><sentence id="1667">So our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">section</span> may have had, I don't know - 40, 50, 60 people, a hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="1668">And she was in charge of getting the census for the inside people in that particular <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1669">Uh, I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with my mother and other mothers and their children.</sentence><sentence id="1670">There were no men in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, but we were, we had free access to the men in the group.</sentence><sentence id="1671">My recollection, interestingly, is that the group was overwhelmingly female and children.</sentence><sentence id="1672">Out of 1600, but I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="1673">I know there were husbands and wives and other kinds of things there, but they were separate latrines.</sentence><sentence id="1674">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">men's latrine</span> - I was a big boy.</sentence><sentence id="1675">So some recollections about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and life and some elements of very peculiar humor and some elements of humanity.</sentence><sentence id="1676">But this was all within the confines of lights, barbed wire, <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, food that is uh indescribable, and live machine guns and

id="2679">Although I have a fairly good recollection, some details escape.</sentence><sentence id="2680">I have no recollection of whether or not she knew any of the members of the kibbutz from her
