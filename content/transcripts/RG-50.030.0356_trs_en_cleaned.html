<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: My name is Flora Singer, my maiden name is Mendelowitz(ph), and in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, Mendelowitz(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchem(ph</span>), which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3">On August 16, 1930.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="10">My dad had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture workshop</span> and mom was a housekeeper, <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, homemaker.</sentence><sentence id="11">We were three small children.</sentence><sentence id="12">And we lived in what was known as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span>, which encompassed sort of six, seven <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner, Saturday we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, but Saturday afternoon sometimes we snuck off to the movies.</sentence><sentence id="14">And life was pleasant, you know, with three sisters, sometimes we played together, other times we fought, we did homework, there was a beautiful clock at the end of our <span class="DLF">street</span>, and after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we'd go and play there, we'd ride our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span>, we'd play ball on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> next to our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and life kind of was pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="15">It was pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="16">On the week-end, on Sundays, neighbors, friends, everybody'd get on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span>, we'd go the <span class="DLF">park</span>, have a picnic.</sentence><sentence id="17">And the <span class="DLF">park</span> was a beautiful <span class="DLF">park</span>, it was called the <span class="DLF">Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park</span> and had a beautiful <span class="DLF">pond</span> with swans and we enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="18">I re-visited it recently and, seems smaller than it did when I was small.</sentence><sentence id="19">And, everything seemed alright for awhile and what I didn't realize, however, was that the, there was a depression.</sentence><sentence id="20">And that my dad was having financial problems.</sentence><sentence id="21">He eventually lost his <span class="BUILDING">business</span> which was, he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">furniture workshop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">He made custom <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">He lost it.</sentence><sentence id="24">And then went off to the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> to get work.</sentence><sentence id="25">People tried to get work just about wherever they could.</sentence><sentence id="26">And, he even worked for the Fourth Company for a short while.</sentence><sentence id="27">And then eventually got a position with a <span class="BUILDING">steamship company</span> and started sailing the seven seas.</sentence><sentence id="28">And this was about early "36, "37.</sentence><sentence id="29">And at</sentence><sentence id="31">that time we had gone back, we had gone, I wouldn't say back exactly, my mom did go back, but we went with my mom to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> because my family originated from there, and that was the last time I saw my grandfather, my grandmother and many of my aunts and uncles.</sentence><sentence id="32">Most of them did perish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">By 1937, we rarely saw my father.</sentence><sentence id="34">We always saw him like every three months, every four months, when he'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for about two or three days and then would take off again.</sentence><sentence id="35">At about the same time, he made the acquaintance of an officer on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamship</span>, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamship</span> he worked on, the man was a German and a Christian.</sentence><sentence id="36">And I'm mentioning that because he'll be coming into our lives later on again.</sentence><sentence id="37">Otherwise, I wouldn't have identified him like that.</sentence><sentence id="38">Carl would not always be able to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> to see his family because time was short, so he would stay with us and we became very fond of him.</sentence><sentence id="39">In 1938, there was an influx of refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">They came from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the whole Jewish community opened up their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for them.</sentence><sentence id="41">We, ourselves, in our small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, had four people staying with us.</sentence><sentence id="42">I think it was four, I'm not sure if it was three or four, but from what I remember, there were two couples.</sentence><sentence id="43">And around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> a lot of talk was going on about what went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, about what I know now to be Chrystalnacht(ph), and I remember becoming fearful, I remember going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and thinking about it and I say, well, maybe we're going to have to run away.</sentence><sentence id="44">And I would ask my mother about it, and she said, don't worry, old people tell stories, they're exaggerating.</sentence><sentence id="45">She says, nothing's happening, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they're civilized countries.</sentence><sentence id="46">The people there are like here, she says, maybe some things are happening, after all, you know, I always tell you that there are people who are antisemetic, and who don't like Jews, but nothing like what they're telling you.</sentence><sentence id="47">So, time went on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Let me just, before you go further, just ask, you said that you lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">Did you have contact with Christian people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Oh, sure.</sentence><sentence id="97">Of course.</sentence><sentence id="98">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and then after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the boys went to what they called <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and the little girls went to what they called <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">We learned how to read and write in Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="101">Of course we had contact because in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> it was mixed.</sentence><sentence id="102">I didn't go to a secular, I mean I went to a <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span>, I didn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">So, yes, we did have contact, but the reason I mentioned the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span>, is, there were Jewish people living all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that I'm speaking of was, I would almost say 90% Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="104">There were Christians living there also, but it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where you had all the kosher butchers, you had <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> almost on every second <span class="DLF">street</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurants</span>, and if you really walk those <span class="DLF">streets</span> you really didn't think there was another world.</sentence><sentence id="105">As a matter of fact, until I went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, I spoke just Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="106">I didn't know there were other languages, except the Hungarian and Rumanian that I heard my parents speak, which I never learned.</sentence><sentence id="107">So, for me, until I went into regular <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, I thought that the only people who existed were Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="108">But then, of course, I came in contact with everyone.</sentence><sentence id="109">And speaking of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, in many of the <span class="REGION">European countries</span>, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> isn't five days a week like here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">You go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, full days.</sentence><sentence id="111">Thursday is a half day and then a half day on Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="112">So, we were not excused from that, although many times, we were absent on Saturdays.</sentence><sentence id="113">However, when we did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, our teacher would excuse us from reading, I mean from writing on the board or writing in our notebooks and then I had one teacher who sat us in the back of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so she would remember who not to call on to write.</sentence><sentence id="114">And that wasn't overly comfortable, but it was something that we adjusted to.</sentence><sentence id="115">And, okay, going back to "38, "39, there was, I remember hearing talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> being invaded and I heard talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> being neutral, but it was very vague at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="116">It wasn't until later that I learned the full history of that.</sentence><sentence id="117">In 1940, the spring of 1940, I was at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">In</sentence><sentence id="120"><span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, you had socialized medicine, you also had a system whereby poor children were offered what they called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresh Air Camp</span> experience.</sentence><sentence id="121">And you would be able to go away for about two weeks to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresh Air Camp</span> to kind of be physically rehabilitated, get good food, get fresh air so that we'd stay healthy.</sentence><sentence id="122">So, I was sent to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for two weeks and one of my sisters was sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">And I remember the morning, this is very clear in my mind, the morning of May 10, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="124">We were sitting and, to the best of my recollection, having breakfast in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, and the radio was playing some music, the music was stopped and an announcement was made that the German armies are walking into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">Which shocked the counselors, everyone, they practically jumped out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">And rushed us to finish our breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="127">Took us back to the <span class="BUILDING">dorms</span>, we had to pack our little bags, they got us onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and took us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">I got there, I remember getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and I remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> being full of people, rushing back and forth and talking.</sentence><sentence id="129">It was very chaotic.</sentence><sentence id="130">Very chaotic.</sentence><sentence id="131">Almost, you know looking back on it now, is I can understand it, what happened is everybody was caught by surprise.</sentence><sentence id="132">Nobody expected it.</sentence><sentence id="133">And people were packing up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, and this holds true for both the Christian and the Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="134">Everyone was running.</sentence><sentence id="135">Because from what I learned later on, is the Belgians were as afraid of the Germans as anybody else would be, at the time.</sentence><sentence id="136">Because during World War IL, there was a lot of resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and...World War I, I'm sorry, I apologize.</sentence><sentence id="137">World War I. There was a lot of resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="138">And, from what I heard at the time, was that the, a lot of torturing took place.</sentence><sentence id="139">So Belgians were tortured and they were frightened.</sentence><sentence id="140">I don't have, myself, any specific cases that I could document, but it's sort of one of these known facts within the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">So, everybody was running.</sentence><sentence id="142">Now, we had a slight problem.</sentence><sentence id="143">My mother and the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="144">By then, of course, remember I said my father was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">Meanwhile, unbeknownst to us, my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in "38, had docked in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and he had a sister who lived in</sentence><sentence id="147"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, who had been sent there after World War I because her father had been killed on the front and there was an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who was willing to take in the little girl and raise her.</sentence><sentence id="148">So, my father called her from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and she says, have you heard?</sentence><sentence id="149">This was after November of 1938, have you heard what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="150">And my father says, no, what are you talking about?She says, don't go back.</sentence><sentence id="151">He says, what do you mean, don't go back?</sentence><sentence id="152">I've got my wife, I've got the two children, I've got to go back.</sentence><sentence id="153">And she urged him to stay and she sent someone for him and they illegally brought him into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">I shouldn't even say this, but he became legalized.</sentence><sentence id="155">He eventually entered the American Army, served honorably and was honorably discharged.</sentence><sentence id="156">As soon as he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and settled down, they started making arrangements to bring us to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">That, they encountered great difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="158">First of all, my father wasn't here legally, as yet.</sentence><sentence id="159">Secondly, we, even if my uncle and aunt made the arrangements to bring us, we fell under the Rumanian quota.</sentence><sentence id="160">The Rumanian quota, as for most Eastern European Jews, was very long.</sentence><sentence id="161">It could sometimes take up to 10 years, waiting to come.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I came across something that was very interesting here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, in the immigration department of the years "37 through "40, immigrants were listed by <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, except for one group.</sentence><sentence id="163">One group was listed as Hebrews.</sentence><sentence id="164">I'll show it to you later.</sentence><sentence id="165">But, anyway, getting back to 1940.</sentence><sentence id="166">I had been sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> as did, my second sister was sent.</sentence><sentence id="167">So, two of us had been away.</sentence><sentence id="168">I was back now, the little one, the youngest was back.</sentence><sentence id="169">The middle one wasn't back yet.</sentence><sentence id="170">Now, mother tried desperately to reach the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">We didn't have a phone in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">She had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to get, actually, most of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">phones</span> were at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span>, to try to call.</sentence><sentence id="173">Somehow, she couldn't get through.</sentence><sentence id="174">And had absolutely no knowledge where my middle sister was.</sentence><sentence id="175">Someone with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trundle seat</span> in the back, getting ready to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, because that's where everybody was heading, everybody was heading towards <span class="REGION">Northern France</span>, offered us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> if we would just go right away.</sentence><sentence id="176">And my</sentence><sentence id="178">mother had a terrible dilemma.</sentence><sentence id="179">Does she take two of us and go, does she wait for the third one and get stuck and lose all the children, as well?</sentence><sentence id="180">And I learned later, of course, at that time I didn't know, although she talked about it, I had a vague recollection of what she was telling me.</sentence><sentence id="181">Because I remember her saying, Florika(ph), that's a diminutive in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> for Flora, we have to try to find Charlotte so we can leave.</sentence><sentence id="182">But, I remember her also saying, if I can't find her, maybe we should go anyway and see if we can find her later on.</sentence><sentence id="183">And, while she was pondering this question, which I now as a mother and a grandmother, I realize it's one of the most difficult ones you ever have to do, and I hope that no mother ever has to ponder this kind of dilemma.</sentence><sentence id="184">She kept talking, but at the same time she started packing some little bags.</sentence><sentence id="185">My youngest sister at the time had the measles and she had a high fever, which was another problem.</sentence><sentence id="186">The people who had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> kept saying, we're leaving, we're not waiting any more.</sentence><sentence id="187">And she kept begging them, wait a little while longer, maybe they'll bring my Charlotte.</sentence><sentence id="188">Finally, they said, no, we're going.</sentence><sentence id="189">And she made a decision.</sentence><sentence id="190">She told one of the neighbors who had decided not to go, to wait out the war or whatever was coming, she says, if my Charlotte comes, please keep her for us.</sentence><sentence id="191">And we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trundle seat</span> in the back, it was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span>, and we, we went.</sentence><sentence id="192">So, it was the two of us and my mom.</sentence><sentence id="193">And her idea was that if we can get to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, maybe to Calais(ph), and maybe get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, <span class="REGION">Great Britain</span>, maybe from there, and she was, pure fantasy.</sentence><sentence id="194">We had no Visas, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="195">But, somehow, this is the plan that she had made.</sentence><sentence id="196">From <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">So, we went.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: Was this kind of exciting for you?</sentence><sentence id="305">Or scary?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: [remember, what I remember is not understanding why we're not waiting for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlotte</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">That I remember.</sentence><sentence id="310">And, it was, I don't know, I can't explain it, it was frightening, I don't remember being excited.</sentence><sentence id="311">I don't remember being excited.</sentence><sentence id="312">It was a lot of chaos, and it was, it was strange.</sentence><sentence id="313">But, I can't say excited in the sense of feeling like I'm living a drama or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="314">No, I don't</sentence><sentence id="316">recall anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="317">I just remember it being very chaotic, very strange, and I remember having to, to just sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and clutching my doll, I had a fairly new doll that I had gotten just before I had gone away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">And I remember clutching my doll and holding on to her, to the doll.</sentence><sentence id="319">My mother placed the little one on my lap, and I remember her being very hot.</sentence><sentence id="320">So, there were very, there were many physical things going on, so mentally, I don't remember too many sensations.</sentence><sentence id="321">I remember being uncomfortable, I remember trying to hold my doll, I remember my sister who was very hot, being placed on my lap, and not understanding why Charlotte wasn't coming with us.</sentence><sentence id="322">That was the middle sister that we couldn't find.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: What else did you take with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: We had two suitcases.</sentence><sentence id="343">They were large in my eyes, but I learned later on that they weren't quite that big.</sentence><sentence id="344">They also started feeling very heavy later on.</sentence><sentence id="345">Anyway, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> went, you couldn't go, you could walk faster than you could ride because, as I said, everybody was running.</sentence><sentence id="346">And, what I didn't learn until later on, is that we were part of the refugees that blocked the <span class="DLF">roads</span> which prevented the Allies, the Allies were the French and some of the British, from pulling back, or trying to get through on the <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">We, because I remember, this was after the war, I remember reading and learning about the <span class="DLF">roads</span> being blocked by refugees, and I learned then that we were part of that group of refugees.</sentence><sentence id="348">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ran out of gas, there wasn't any to be gotten, so they just, the people left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, so we left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and then we were on our own.</sentence><sentence id="349">We slept in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, wherever you could just find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">With our suitcases.</sentence><sentence id="351">Or a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> somewhere, if a farmer allowed you to stay in there.</sentence><sentence id="352">And we did, we did make it to Calais(ph).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Well, we did get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for a short while, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, people had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">It took several days.</sentence><sentence id="368">Neither myself or my mom remembered precisely how</sentence><sentence id="370">many days, but it was several days.</sentence><sentence id="371">I remember being, we were in a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, and this was in Calais(ph), but not near the <span class="DLF">port</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">And we were, our plan was at that point, mom decided, well, maybe we shouldn't just go to the <span class="DLF">port</span> to try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span>, maybe we should just try to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, maybe that would be safer.</sentence><sentence id="373">So, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, and I remember being very tired and we had slept on our suitcases in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then we decided to just abandon one suitcase because mom had to carry my little sister who was four, and who, not quite, this was in May and she wasn't four until the following, the next month, June.</sentence><sentence id="374">What's happening to my English?</sentence><sentence id="375">It's funny, when I get emotional, I lose my ability to speak.</sentence><sentence id="376">We left one suitcase in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">I remember we hid it behind a corner because we were afraid someone would see us and run after us and tell us we left a suitcase.</sentence><sentence id="378">We thought that was illegal.</sentence><sentence id="379">We then went to the <span class="DLF">port</span> and we, I sat on a suitcase, the one suitcase that we had left, with my little sister and my mother saw a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and they were loading soldiers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="380">And she went over there and she spoke to someone.</sentence><sentence id="381">I didn't know who she spoke to, but she spoke to someone and when she came back she said, we're going to wait here, maybe they'll take us, they're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">So, we sat.</sentence><sentence id="384">And we sat through the night and they kept loading wounded soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="385">By dawn, the man mom had spoken to walked over to us and he said, sorry, there's no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, it's full.</sentence><sentence id="386">And he couldn't take us.</sentence><sentence id="387">So, we tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="388">As we were walking away, we saw people screaming, anybody want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> here, you can come, every, people just loaded onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">I learned later that this was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was abandoned and someone who knew how to steer just took the, just went in took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and invited people to come onto it.</sentence><sentence id="390">Because, I mean, it's incredible and it's difficult to describe, what things looked like.</sentence><sentence id="391">It was just, people were running and coming and going and nothing was the way nor...quote, normal.</sentence><sentence id="392">And we decided, great, we're going to go onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">So, we came and we went on.</sentence><sentence id="394">Now, there were, it</sentence><sentence id="396">wasn't a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, but it was still good size.</sentence><sentence id="397">And there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span>, and we sat against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, against a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span>, but facing the <span class="DLF">dock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="398">Other people sat on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> facing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="399">And, I'm saying this for a reason, what happened, once the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was full, suddenly the tide went down as it typically does towards evening, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> tilted.</sentence><sentence id="400">The people on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> started sliding down because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> kept tilting.</sentence><sentence id="401">We ended up sitting on the <span class="DLF">cabin wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">But, we were safe.</sentence><sentence id="403">And, of course, they did manage to save most of the people.</sentence><sentence id="404">They threw them <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ladders</span> and we were all pulled up.</sentence><sentence id="405">From there we found a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, we gave up on going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="406">We found a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> was giving out milk for children and things like that, so we got a little milk and then we went out to try to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="407">As we were walking the <span class="DLF">street</span>, the sirens came on and we ended up in a <span class="DLF">shelter</span>, a <span class="DLF">bomb shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">We stayed there for awhile, when the clear siren rang, mom said, you know what, you stay here with Betty, I'll go find us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="409">So, she left me in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and I sat there by myself with my little sister.</sentence><sentence id="410">And I sat and I waited and I waited and I waited.</sentence><sentence id="411">And then after awhile I panicked.</sentence><sentence id="412">And I went out of the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> with my little sister, meanwhile she kept crying, she was thirsty, and I had nothing to give her.</sentence><sentence id="413">So, the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were deserted and they were fairly dark, and I walked screaming, mamma, mamma, mamma, all of a sudden I hear someone calling, Flora, Flora, Flora.</sentence><sentence id="414">Mom had forgotten where she had left us, because we didn't know Calais(ph).</sentence><sentence id="415">So, she was walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> hoping that I would have left the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> maybe, and she kept calling and hoping that I would hear and I was calling, so we did find each other.</sentence><sentence id="416">At that point, we went, found another <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, well, to make a long story short, because this was lengthy, we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulangsumere(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="417">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulangsumere(ph</span>) we stayed put.</sentence><sentence id="418">By then the German Army had walked into <span class="REGION">Northern France</span>, and we got stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulangsumere(ph</span>), so we stayed there, we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay with a woman who had a <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and mom helped her so that we could eat.</sentence><sentence id="419">And we were there for, I would say, about five or six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="422">0 By then an order came out that anyone who was not a legal resident of <span

everything.</sentence><sentence id="425">And we hitchhiked.</sentence><sentence id="426">As a matter of fact, with German soldiers, we did hitchhike.</sentence><sentence id="427">Anyway, we made it

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="513">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="514">Okay, here's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="515">While mom was helping the woman working in the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and everything else, my little sister and I, we wandered the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">And every time you had sirens and you had the bombing, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were bombed, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were broken, and people, people broke <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">And we passed, it was a <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> that we had, we kept pass, it was more than a <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span>, because they also had clothing.</sentence><sentence id="518">And there was a pair of white boots in the <span class="DLF">window</span> [laughter], it was kind of a silly thing in the middle of a war, but anyway, it was a pair of white boots that I kept looking at.</sentence><sentence id="519">I just, oh, would I love to have those white boots!</sentence><sentence id="520">Anyway, this particular day, my sister and I were walking and we see a lot of people in front of this <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="521">And we get there and we see people walking out with packages, the <span class="DLF">window</span> was broken, it was an absolute mess.</sentence><sentence id="522">And I saw, so I went over, and I somehow, we made our way into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I see the white boots.</sentence><sentence id="523">And I</sentence><sentence id="525">1 grabbed the white boots and there was two rain coats, another kind of a coat, and I grabbed that and a pair of boots for my sister, and we ran out.</sentence><sentence id="526">I didn't even try them on.</sentence><sentence id="527">I just thought, approximately, I just grabbed them.</sentence><sentence id="528">Anyway, they did fit.</sentence><sentence id="529">And I loved them.</sentence><sentence id="530">And she loved hers.</sentence><sentence id="531">And we, and the rain coat.</sentence><sentence id="532">And we come back, I come to the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span>, and the first thing my mother says is, what in the world is that?</sentence><sentence id="533">So, I told her, I says, everybody was taking, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was open, everybody was taking.</sentence><sentence id="534">So, she was, I learned later, at the time she just said, you're not supposed to take things you don't pay for them.</sentence><sentence id="535">But, she did not take them away from us.</sentence><sentence id="536">We kept them.</sentence><sentence id="537">Anyway, one day [laughter] I was, you know, in the middle of chaos, in the middle of such dramatic times, there were these moments that there is some humor to it in a way, but I didn't laugh at the time.</sentence><sentence id="538">One day, I'm walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and all of a sudden I feel somebody grabbing me by the back.</sentence><sentence id="539">It was the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">And he made me take off the boots and the rain coat, which I wore sunshine or rain or whatever, so that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="541">Is that what you were referring to?Well, I didn't steal for a long time, I was told later on that this was stealing.</sentence><sentence id="542">So my mother was in a dilemma at that time, too.</sentence><sentence id="543">You know?</sentence><sentence id="544">It wasn't a time where you taught children honesty or not, you know?</sentence><sentence id="545">You survived.</sentence><sentence id="546">Anyhow, we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> eventually.</sentence><sentence id="547">There were a few incidents, like I would brag, you know, really, you want to get food, you know, if you were little, even adults would push you aside, okay, get away, get away.</sentence><sentence id="548">And they were stronger, so they would push you out of <span class="DLF">line</span>, because they wanted the bread.</sentence><sentence id="549">But, anyway, we made it, we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and one of the neighbors did have Charlotte.</sentence><sentence id="550">Charlotte, I don't know whether she ever speaks about it, as a matter of fact, she was just interviewed by the Spielberg(ph) project and I don't know if she ever, can you edit this out?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: Oh, you're not going to edit.</sentence><sentence id="598">Well then, well anyway, I don't know if she ever forgave mom.</sentence><sentence id="599">I don't know if she's mentioned it even, but I must ask her, but I don't know if she ever forgave mom.</sentence><sentence id="600">I don't think she ever understood why mamma took off without her.</sentence><sentence id="601">And she asked a few times, and mom could not explain it.</sentence><sentence id="602">She kept saying, I thought I could save two children instead of losing three.</sentence><sentence id="603">That was her answer.</sentence><sentence id="604">And there were difficult decisions to be made.</sentence><sentence id="605">I felt sorry for mom, because that's, I know this was something that was always on her mind, it was always there.</sentence><sentence id="606">Anyway, we settled back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, and, except for bombs, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that we heard, seeing German soldiers in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, life took up a normal routine again.</sentence><sentence id="607">September, we went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="608">By October, however, Jews were supposed to register.</sentence><sentence id="609">Registering was that you had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">municipal building</span>, , administration and register.</sentence><sentence id="610">Now, the question comes up sometimes, well, what if you didn't register?</sentence><sentence id="611">You were known because in Europe, people carry identity cards.</sentence><sentence id="612">After the war when I turned 15, I received an identity card.</sentence><sentence id="613">As a matter of fact, I carry one, I still have it, it says, stranger.</sentence><sentence id="614">Born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, nationality, <span class="COUNTRY">Rumanian</span>.</sentence><sentence id="615">The Rumanians never recognized me as a Rumanian national, and the Belgians didn't recognize me as a Belgian national.</sentence><sentence id="616">It's something I always resented.</sentence><sentence id="617">And, so whether you wanted to or not, you were registered, but you had to officially register.</sentence><sentence id="618">So, mom registered, everybody did.</sentence><sentence id="619">The attitude was that, if you obey the law, you'll be fine.</sentence><sentence id="620">And, a little later on, men were called up for forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="621">My mother's youngest sister also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="622">And she had a little boy who was born early in 1940, and her husband had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">He came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> around, oh somewheres around "38, just about that time when they got married.</sentence><sentence id="624">And my uncle was called up.</sentence><sentence id="625">He went.</sentence><sentence id="626">And he came back three months later.</sentence><sentence id="627">Many of the men went and they came back three months later.</sentence><sentence id="628">And, see?</sentence><sentence id="629">If we obey, if we do what we're supposed to do, it's no problem.</sentence><sentence id="630">Then, my uncle was called up again.</sentence><sentence id="631">My mother had almost like a sixth sense about things.</sentence><sentence id="632">She lived a lot by</sentence><sentence id="634">3 intuition, but it served her well.</sentence><sentence id="635">She said at one point, she said, Alex, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="636">I don't think you should go.</sentence><sentence id="637">And he did listen, and he took his wife and child and they escaped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="638">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> it was easier to get lost.</sentence><sentence id="639">It had a small, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sashiel(ph</span>), one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span>, it had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, but it wasn't quite as big or as defined as the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="640"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> was almost, a good part of it was what you call almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="641">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> you could get lost a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="642">Then, you know, as time went on, we wore the star, it wasn't any fun to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the star, but we didn't have to worry about it too long because we were told you couldn't go to, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, you couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="643">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, the Jewish children were still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="692">Q: What, what were you doing for money?</sentence><sentence id="693">For food, or...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="696">A: Mom worked.</sentence><sentence id="697">Mom worked.</sentence><sentence id="698">She did some dressmaking and we each had a job.</sentence><sentence id="699">I did handwork, I hemmed.</sentence><sentence id="700">Because lace was hard to obtain, so you made little scallops on the bottom of slips, on top, we made women's slips, so I was in charge of the scallops.</sentence><sentence id="701">One of my sisters was in charge of turning, we made, mom made, of straps.</sentence><sentence id="702">You see, things are different today.</sentence><sentence id="703">To make straps, you made kind of a little tube and then you turned it inside out with a safety pin, and then you attached it to the slip, and one of my sisters was in charge of turning the straps inside out.</sentence><sentence id="704">And then one of us would deliver it, because they were piecemeal, they were made for someone and then we would deliver it, and, she also worked in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, because by her working in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> we were able to go have dinner there, so it helped with the food.</sentence><sentence id="705">She was always a very hard worker, even when she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">She's a Rock of Gibraltar, four eleven but an incredible little lady.</sentence><sentence id="707">As a matter of fact, she was one of six sisters and the only one who lived after the war.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="708">The difference between her and her sisters, let me just make a comment.</sentence><sentence id="709">I was at a conference about two weeks ago where Lyle(ph) Hilberg(ph) and Yahuda(ph) Ballo(ph) were debating whether</sentence></p><p><sentence id="712">4 survival depended on pure luck or whether it was the personality of individuals that helped them to survive.</sentence><sentence id="713">And when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I, that whole night I thought about that, and, of course, I related it to our own personal lives, and I realized that short of physically being taken and killed, a lot of it had to do with personality.</sentence><sentence id="714">Knowing when to take advantage of an opportunity and acting upon it without too much debate, without too much reflection.</sentence><sentence id="715">To move, to constantly move.</sentence><sentence id="716">Mom was like that, but she had been a rebel way back.</sentence><sentence id="717">She came from a very religious orthodox family in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="718">She was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget(ph</span>) which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="719">And she was the only one of six sisters who decided to leave and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="720">So there was part of a rebel, not someone who is going to just sit still and let life lead her.</sentence><sentence id="721">She eventually brought her younger sister to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">And the same thing happened during the war.</sentence><sentence id="723">I know you want me to talk chronologically, but let me jump ahead a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="724">At one point when we were going into hiding, the problem you ran into with that was that the people who would hide you, particularly there was an official, not an official, an organized network in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that hid children, but they couldn't tell you where they would take the children to.</sentence><sentence id="725">Because if you were caught, what you didn't know you couldn't tell, should you be tortured.</sentence><sentence id="726">So, they didn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="727">My aunt wouldn't let her child go, she could not bring herself to let him go.</sentence><sentence id="728">My mom took the risk, we're alive, my little cousin is not.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="729">When my aunt and uncle were already in our clandestine <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, which they never left in more than eight months, and my mother begged them to accompany her to another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, my aunt's attitude was, there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to run, they'll find us, where are we gonna run?</sentence><sentence id="730">My aunt is not alive, she died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and mom lived.</sentence><sentence id="731">Because mom, that does not mean that mom could not have gotten caught, but she still, she kept acting, she kept moving and trying.</sentence><sentence id="732">Anyway, going back...</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="737">Q: I wanted you to talk to me a little bit more about the various restrictions placed upon Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and how you felt about that, how it impacted you, your <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, your play, everything.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="739">We couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">At one point we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="741">Actually, yeah, we were supposed to go to a, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> were still operating a little bit, but technically, we couldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="742">Then Jews had to give up their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">Jews had to give up their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">And there was this constant attitude, well, if we do what we're told to do, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> is very important in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="745">I mean, people practically lived on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="746">But that, okay, so you give up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, so you give up this.</sentence><sentence id="747">Then, but there was, you became upset, you became angry because you couldn't have your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> any more, because you couldn't have radios any more.</sentence><sentence id="748">Also, once we started wearing the star, we didn't risk as much going out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">We didn't live in an official <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, as they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span> and places like that, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but for all practical purposes, once we wore the star we might as well have lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">Because, you didn't dare venture out too far from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="751">You didn't feel comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="752">If you, for example, when I was, just before I was told we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, I would wear the star and I would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I'd hold a book up sort of covering my star.</sentence><sentence id="753">And youngsters would walk over and pull away the book and say, don't you know it's a crime to cover up your star?</sentence><sentence id="754">Which was true.</sentence><sentence id="755">It was a crime, you weren't supposed to cover it up.</sentence><sentence id="756">But, even children were drawn into that situation, and children can be cruel.</sentence><sentence id="757">So, it did create a lot of discomfort.</sentence><sentence id="758">You couldn't go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> anymore, it was forbidden to go there.</sentence><sentence id="759">You couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">movies</span>, Jews weren't allowed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">You couldn't go to an <span class="BUILDING">ice cream parlor</span> or <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span>, there were signs, signs went up different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="761">So, you found yourself sort of retreating.</sentence><sentence id="762">The only saving grace, so to speak, that there was, was that you weren't alone.</sentence><sentence id="763">Other kids were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">Your neighbors were in the same situation.</sentence><sentence id="765">So, that kind, and you did, it was, the feelings were very strange.</sentence><sentence id="766">It was, you found yourself being very, at that</sentence><sentence id="768">6 point, I remember becoming very unhappy.</sentence><sentence id="769">And, not understanding why.</sentence><sentence id="770">I knew what was going on, but what I couldn't understand is the why.</sentence><sentence id="771">What did we do?</sentence><sentence id="772">Why us?</sentence><sentence id="773">I remembered before the war, we were happy, we went, we came, and then all of a sudden, everything changed, and that is where I had great difficulty, with that why.</sentence><sentence id="774">Then there was another element for us, personally, at that point, mom got upset with dad.</sentence><sentence id="775">He's in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, he's, why did he leave us, you know, somehow thinking that if he had been there, he would have been okay.</sentence><sentence id="776">We would have all been okay, which we wouldn't have been.</sentence><sentence id="777">It would have probably even been worse.</sentence><sentence id="778">For the simple reason, being alone, she made all the decisions, she didn't have to consult and there didn't have to be a discussion as to should we, shouldn't we.</sentence><sentence id="779">She decided, and we did.</sentence><sentence id="780">But, it was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="781">My little sisters had even greater difficulty with it.</sentence><sentence id="782">And I found myself constantly saying, don't worry, it'll be okay.</sentence><sentence id="783">It'll be okay.</sentence><sentence id="784">Because there was crying, why can't we go here, why can't we go there, and why can't we do this.</sentence><sentence id="785">And then food started being a problem because Jews, the rationing stamps were stopped for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="786">We couldn't have rationing stamps.</sentence><sentence id="787">Now, if you didn't have rationing stamps, you couldn't buy food.</sentence><sentence id="788">We still had a small advantage.</sentence><sentence id="789">Mom worked in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> as a cook.</sentence><sentence id="790">So, we were able to go and have a meal there, but even that slowed down because the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> had to start using ration stamps, so then we couldn't have, and

was called to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it was because a child did not behave.</sentence><sentence id="1242">So, my reaction was, well, we're good, my sisters are good, we didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1243">And she says, no, I know you didn't do anything, I want to talk to mom.</sentence><sentence id="1244">So, when, meanwhile, just prior to that, also, all that

receive a glass of milk every day.</sentence><sentence id="1246">That was like for poor children, but what we didn't know is that those winter coats and the milk came from an industrialist,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1307">Q: Now, before we go into that chapter, I just have a couple additional questions.</sentence><sentence id="1308">When, after moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, did you ever have occasion to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, what was that...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1314">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1315">I should have mentioned that earlier.</sentence><sentence id="1316">Once we

didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="1325">She says, my attitude was, why don't you go?</sentence><sentence id="1326">She says, you're a child, you can go.</sentence><sentence id="1327">You don't have an identity card.</sentence><sentence id="1328">You see, children didn't walk around with identity cards unless they were Jewish and wore the star.</sentence><sentence id="1329">She says, you'll go, you'll tell everybody that's something's going to happen and then you'll come back.</sentence><sentence id="1330">So, the one thing, we always obeyed.</sentence><sentence id="1331">My mother, we did not disobey my mother, ever.</sentence><sentence id="1332">Of course, if we could help it, but, we did obey.</sentence><sentence id="1333">And I went.</sentence><sentence id="1334">I went.</sentence><sentence id="1335">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, and I was looking for someone to tell

it getting between day and night and I said, I really want to go back, but I didn't do what I was supposed to do.</sentence><sentence id="1346">And while I was walking and debating what to do, I hear a knock near the bottom of my feet.</sentence><sentence id="1347">And I look down and I see a hand saying...it was someone who was related to us, like a distant cousins and relatives who were in, down near that, it</sentence><sentence id="1349">7 was like a <span class="DLF">cellar window</span>, like one of those little <span class="DLF">cellar windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1350">I knew how to get into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1351">I went down two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and went in and I made my way down to that <span

I said to them, well, you better come with me.</sentence><sentence id="1361">And they said, no, we have food for several weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And there's no <span

the only way I can describe it.</sentence><sentence id="1367">If they became paralyzed like, we can't, where are we going to go?There was, there was a panic that set in, that kind of paralyzed them.</sentence><sentence id="1368">There was like a disbelief also.</sentence><sentence id="1369">Because here you, don't forget, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was a very free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1370">You were able to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and say, I'm a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1371">I mean, very tolerant, the Belgian government paid for <span class="BUILDING">parochial schools</span> be they Jewish, be they Christian, Catholic, Protestant, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1372">See, but in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, even though you did have the fascists, you did have those components, but on the whole, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was a comfortable <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2332">Q: At this point, did you know much about what was going on with the war and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2334">A: At this point I knew, because at this point already, people jumped <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and people who escaped, somehow managed to come back and tell and, it was like, there was like, an unofficial, there was a <span class="DLF">grapevine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2335">There was a <span class="DLF">grapevine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2336">People picked up and, the Resistance was a big conduit of that</sentence><sentence id="2338">3 information, too.</sentence><sentence id="2339">Because there were Jews involved, too.</sentence><sentence id="2340">There were a lot of Jews who were with the Resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2341">There was, in fact, there was a group called the Commite(ph) Defance(ph) De(ph) Schwif(ph), the Committee for the Defense of the Jews, which was a Jewish group.</sentence><sentence id="2342">As a matter of fact, I met one, the head of that group, Mrs. Strassberg(ph), just this spring in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2343">And they worked with the Resistance and with the group with Father Bruno and an attorney Vandenberg(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2344">As a matter of fact, Vandenberg(ph) was a Christian who died in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2345">He was arrested, not for hiding Jews, but for hiding people who hid because they didn't want to go for forced labor, because, you know, Christians also were taken for forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="2346">It wasn't just Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2347">So, he did die in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2348">You know, there were like a lot of, as I said, I just translated a book, I'm just about putting the polishing touches on it, on this network and these people who were helped.</sentence><sentence id="2349">It was an incredible operation.</sentence><sentence id="2350">So, but at that time, I wasn't aware of who was totally involved, except that the name, Father Bruno came up.</sentence><sentence id="2351">And not only that, until 1993, I didn't even know the name of the person who took us to the last <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2352">Because here's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2353">We were supposed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and meet a woman dressed in a certain manner, no name given, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2354">We were just supposed to kind of make eye contact with the woman and so, actually, mom did and her.</sentence><sentence id="2355">Although, and we had to stand apart from, our mom stood in one <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, we stood in another <span class="NPIP">spot</span>, the woman stood in another <span class="NPIP">spot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">Although, we saw each other, and our instructions were that, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled in and this particular woman went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, that we were to follow her, sit down where she sat down, but not to address her.</sentence><sentence id="2357">But, you know, when I think about it, as I'm saying, it's amazing that we were able to carry all this out.</sentence><sentence id="2358">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="2359">We did.</sentence><sentence id="2360">We did exactly as we were told.</sentence><sentence id="2361">At that time, and when I think back, one of the hardest things that I personally ever did, and I talked to my sisters, and for them, too, was not to say goodbye to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="2362">Not to hug her.</sentence><sentence id="2363">You know, you go off on a</sentence><sentence id="2365">4 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, still, we were still kids, by then, when we left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> it was early September, "43, by then, I was 13, Charlotte was 10 and Betty was seven.</sentence><sentence id="2366">So, we, and also, I said, rumors had started coming back because one of the people that had jumped a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, as a matter of fact, was a friend of mom's, who was one of the refugees in 1938 who had stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2367">Because there was a Mr. and Mrs. Gross(ph) who had stayed with us.</sentence><sentence id="2368">And Mr. Gross(ph) had jumped a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2369">And found mom, because he knew her, because, you know, through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span>, you kind of let each other know where you are.</sentence><sentence id="2370">And, he had given information.</sentence><sentence id="2371">Then, there was another person who had jumped a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and had come, that we knew.</sentence><sentence id="2372">And, there was no, not only was there no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, but also being the Gestapo was, I guess, must have been searching for him, mom hid him.</sentence><sentence id="2373">See, she had these false papers, so she was able to move around.</sentence><sentence id="2374">She hid him in a <span class="BUILDING">bombed out building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2375">Gave him blankets, whatever we had and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2376">And she took food to him.</sentence><sentence id="2377">And then one day, he wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="2378">Because he, he was pretty badly wounded, he could barely, he had great difficulty walking at that point, because from the jumping, that, I don't know what happened to him to this day.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="2436">We weren't allowed to do any of those things.</sentence><sentence id="2437">We just literally had to ignore her and pretend that she was a stranger.</sentence><sentence id="2438">And I remember it being very, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2439">It went totally against my being because we were a touching family.</sentence><sentence id="2440">We always hugged, we touched and here we couldn't even, not only not touch her, we couldn't even look at her and say goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="2441">Or even from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, wave goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="2442">Or anything.</sentence><sentence id="2443">And we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2444">We didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2445">We went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, we followed the lady who, as I said, in 1993 I learned her name, it was Mrs. Vandervagen(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2446">And she was a Christian woman, poor woman, who did this.</sentence><sentence id="2447">And the only thing she asked for in return was reimbursement for a little lunch that she bought.</sentence><sentence id="2448">Unfortunately, I didn't find her alive, so I could thank her personally.</sentence><sentence id="2449">She, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, which I know now to be Werselater(ph), we followed her out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and, not until we were quite a bit of a distance from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, did she stop, turn around, sort of spread her arms out around us, say, I'm taking you to a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2450">And she took us to the convent of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werselater(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="2451">Werselater(ph) was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, it also had an <span class="DLF">orchard</span>, it had a <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2452">During the war, however, in addition to the regular <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, they added one of the wings of the, they took one of the wings of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> rather, and turned it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresh Air camp</span> for poor children, children whose fathers were prisoners of war, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2453">And every three months a new group of children came.</sentence><sentence id="2454">They left, they never came back.</sentence><sentence id="2455">They had no visitors during the three months that they were there.</sentence><sentence id="2456">In the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, the children had visitors every weekend.</sentence><sentence id="2457">They went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for holidays, they came back.</sentence><sentence id="2458">Even the physical facilities were very different.</sentence><sentence id="2459">In the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">children's dormitory</span> was divided up into little cubbyholes, each child had sort of an <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nightstand</span>, small <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> for their clothing, and a curtain so they could have a</sentence><sentence id="2461">6 little privacy.</sentence><sentence id="2462">Their <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> had small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, tablecloth, flowers, and it was a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with large <span class="DLF">windows</span> and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="2463">Being the other set-up was a temporary set-up, the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and metal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, one next to the other.</sentence><sentence id="2464">Just divided by a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nightstand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2465">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> were long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, set up where children sat one next to the other.</sentence><sentence id="2466">There was, to me, that was a very important distinction.</sentence><sentence id="2467">In addition to that, in the <span class="BUILDING">colony</span>, as it was called, there was one teacher for all the grades, and she did, basically what she did was babysit and not really teach much.</sentence><sentence id="2468">She disciplined.</sentence><sentence id="2469">She was not a nun, she was a secular teacher who had been brought in.</sentence><sentence id="2470">And the older children helped with darning socks.</sentence><sentence id="2471">I learned how to do beautiful darning work.</sentence><sentence id="2472">I can still darn nicely to this day.</sentence><sentence id="2473">And, we helped kind of watch the little ones and all that and being I was one of the older ones, by then I was in charge, in addition to being in charge.</sentence><sentence id="2474">I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2475">I wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> and I remember asking the Mother Superior, why can't I go to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2476">And she said, for security reasons.</sentence><sentence id="2477">She said, here there are no visitors, no one is asking questions as to why I don't go to communion.</sentence><sentence id="2478">The children leave, they never come back.</sentence><sentence id="2479">In the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> she felt that, at some point, somebody would ask questions.</sentence><sentence id="2480">So, she says, unless, if you had been baptized, she says, I could let you go to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2481">That was the only, if you could call it mention, of my, perhaps, becoming baptized.</sentence><sentence id="2482">Otherwise, outside of that, never was there any pressure or anything.</sentence><sentence id="2483">The other girl that was there, there were two girls, actually, we were five, to the best of my knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="2484">One of them did not stay too long.</sentence><sentence id="2485">She did an awful lot of crying.</sentence><sentence id="2486">She, one day, just vanished.</sentence><sentence id="2487">And my assumption was, that, because she couldn't control her emotions, they couldn't afford to keep her.</sentence><sentence id="2488">Because the one thing, and not only from my own experiences, but from speaking to other children who have been hidden, you had to be, quote, a good child.</sentence><sentence id="2489">And when I say good, as I said, you had to be able to obey, you had to be able to be quiet when you were told to be quiet.</sentence><sentence id="2490">You had to not</sentence><sentence id="2492">7 cry.</sentence><sentence id="2493">In other words, you had to almost be invisible.</sentence><sentence id="2494">To be kept.</sentence><sentence id="2495">So, and the other girl that was there, eventually, was baptized and went to, the one was sent away, the other one was baptized and went to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2496">As a matter of fact, I did meet her again here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2497">She's Jewish today.</sentence><sentence id="2498">She felt that there was pressure put on her to be baptized.</sentence><sentence id="2499">My experience, having been in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, was that there was no pressure put on us.</sentence><sentence id="2500">Never did anyone, any of the nuns, say to me, you have to be baptized, I heard them say, or you'll go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2501">Never.</sentence><sentence id="2502">We did learn catechism, we had to everything the other children did, short of going to communion.</sentence><sentence id="2503">We went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, prayed and studied <span class="BUILDING">catechism</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2504">That, she did teach us, that teacher.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2579">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="2580">Nobody knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2581">The, as a matter of fact, when, at the end, they were packing to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they said, so I guess, we're all going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="2582">I said, yes, we're all going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="2583">Except, that they went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="2584">Eventually, we were there for 13 months.</sentence><sentence id="2585">When <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was liberated, we stayed awhile, back, later.</sentence><sentence id="2586">In April of 1944, my, one day, mom, I'm going to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> on this.</sentence><sentence id="2587">But, of course, this I don't know from personal experience.</sentence><sentence id="2588">I only know this through mom.</sentence><sentence id="2589">Mom, as I said, was sleeping the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and taking food to my aunt and uncle that he had brought into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2590">She came one evening with the food and there was a Gestapo seal on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2591">Now, what is a Gestapo seal?</sentence><sentence id="2592">Whenever the Gestapo would empty a <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> of the inhabitants and take them away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, they would seal the <span class="DLF">door</span> with a seal, a Gestapo seal, which was easily removable, we're not talking about anything that, it was a sort of a cardboard, paper kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="2593">Like a sticker.</sentence><sentence id="2594">Which meant no trespassing.</sentence><sentence id="2595">A few days later they would come back with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and empty the contents of the <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2596">From us, they didn't get that much.</sentence><sentence id="2597">Because, don't forget, this was already late, you know, when we ran and everything, so, basically, the few things that we assembled weren't of any</sentence><sentence id="2599">8 great value.</sentence><sentence id="2600">But in many <span class="BUILDING">residences</span>, they did get great value.</sentence><sentence id="2601">They'd come back and they'd empty the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2602">And it was called mublakseum(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2603">And what they did is they took the possessions back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or whatever, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2604">And, as I said, I know people are still claiming artwork that they took.</sentence><sentence id="2605">She came, there was a Gestapo seal, she knew immediately what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="2606">But, she was, she had enough sofwau(ph), as they say, I don't know, how do you say, I mean, she was cool enough, calm enough, because she was, she had an incredible strength.</sentence><sentence id="2607">Opened the seal, went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, took the albums out, she had this obsession, the albums.</sentence><sentence id="2608">And it was after that that the albums went to a Christian family.</sentence><sentence id="2609">And she took a cover for herself, so she could be a little warmer.</sentence><sentence id="2610">And that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2611">And took off.</sentence><sentence id="2612">I mean, if they had caught her, I don't even think they would have taken her to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, they would have probably killed her immediately.</sentence><sentence id="2613">I get a letter, now here's the thing, when we were hidden, and this held true for other children, also.</sentence><sentence id="2614">We were receiving mail.</sentence><sentence id="2615">Not by official post, but by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couriers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2616">And I would, I got mail, it wasn't a weekly thing or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2617">But, I did get mail from mom and I was able to respond.</sentence><sentence id="2618">Mother Superior calls me into her <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, I didn't know that my aunt and uncle were taken, and the baby, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2619">Mother Superior calls me into her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day, and says to me, Flora, read this letter from mamma.</sentence><sentence id="2620">And I read the letter and she says, what's your mother saying?</sentence><sentence id="2621">I said, I think my mother is saying that my aunt and uncle and Nunu(ph), we used to call my cousin that, were taken by the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="2622">She says, exactly what I think.</sentence><sentence id="2623">Cause see, my aunt, my mother wrote in code.</sentence><sentence id="2624">She said, dearest Flora, your aunt and uncle and your little cousin went away on vacation to visit the rest of the family.</sentence><sentence id="2625">I don't know when they'll be back and I don't, something to the effect, I don't know what to do in the meantime.</sentence><sentence id="2626">So, she, the Mother Superior picked up on that and I immediately knew what it meant, because nobody went on vacation, you know, if you were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2627">You know, but then, see, by that point in the war, I already knew, there were enough rumors coming back, that</sentence><sentence id="2629">9 we kind of knew what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="2630">We didn't know about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, we just knew people were being deported and somewhere they were being killed, they vanished, that's what we knew.</sentence><sentence id="2631">She told me to send my mom a letter.</sentence><sentence id="2632">Dear mamma, why don't you come visit us while Aunt Leah(ph) and Uncle Alex(ph) are on vacation?</sentence><sentence id="2633">And my mother came.</sentence><sentence id="2634">She, by then, even with false papers, it was getting dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="2635">So, what she did is, she walked the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> at night, slept under bushes during the day, and when she ran out of food that she had, she took from the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2636">It's a very fertile <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, there are always things growing.</sentence><sentence id="2637">And, she came, by this, by that time already, of course, it was May of "44.</sentence><sentence id="2638">And she stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2639">We couldn't, Mother Superior gave her a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, under the <span class="DLF">staircase</span>, I'll never forget it.</sentence><sentence id="2640">She helped out in the <span class="DLF">orchard</span>, by her own free will because she didn't want to eat for nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2641">And, once a week, we were allowed to see her.</sentence><sentence id="2642">Outside of that once a week when the Mother Superior would come and take us for a half hour visit, we were not allowed to see her.</sentence><sentence id="2643">If we did see her somewheres in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> or in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span>, we had to pretend we didn't know her.</sentence><sentence id="2644">It was not that easy, the other girl knew it was my mother, but, the day of her birthday, her birthday was, this was at the end of June, her birthday was in June, June 29th to be precise.</sentence><sentence id="2645">We were allowed to see her on her birthday.</sentence><sentence id="2646">And the Mother Superior, the first cherries had just been coming out, they were very early, but these were very early cherries, unless she got them somewhere else that I don't know about.</sentence><sentence id="2647">There was a box of cherries, a metal box of cherries that she gave mom for her birthday.</sentence><sentence id="2648">And then there was an envelope with some money.</sentence><sentence id="2649">And I remember mom protesting about the money.</sentence><sentence id="2650">And she said, this might have been past her birthday, this was on one of the visits to her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, with the Mother Superior.</sentence><sentence id="2651">It could have even been later, because I distinctly remember it being cherries.</sentence><sentence id="2652">Because mom loved cherries.</sentence><sentence id="2653">And she, mom said, you're hiding me, you're hiding my children, you're feeding me, why are you giving me money?</sentence><sentence id="2654">She says, hopefully, the war will</sentence><sentence id="2656">0 be over soon, you'll need it.</sentence><sentence id="2657">And she insisted.</sentence><sentence id="2658">I think it was something like two hundred fifty or three hundred franks in there, which wasn't much, but, it was just, even symbolically, it was just a beautiful gesture.</sentence><sentence id="2659">And, mom had to endure quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="2660">There were a couple of people, adults, who were also residing in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2661">And there was one couple who was living there, an elderly couple, and, this woman, the woman kept saying to mom, gee, it's so good, it's great to get rid of all these Jews, and mom had to endure this.</sentence><sentence id="2662">And couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2663">And one of the first, and all kinds of remarks and everything, and one of the first things my mom did after the liberation, was go over to her, she says, what do you think of me?</sentence><sentence id="2664">She says, oh, but, you're such a wonderful lady, Mrs. Fiers, I always enjoyed talking to you and everything, you know, you're great.</sentence><sentence id="2665">Mom says, you know something?</sentence><sentence id="2666">I'm a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2667">Well, the woman's face dropped, needless to say, because all these things that she said about the Jews and how wonderful it is to finally get rid of them, blah, blah, blah, blah.</sentence><sentence id="2668">Anyway, after liberation, the Mother Superior suggested that the two little ones stay in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and that just mom and I went back, go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> to see what we can do to get settled again.</sentence><sentence id="2669">So, she and I went back.</sentence><sentence id="2670">It was, you know, even that time was chaotic because we were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="2671">And, I'll never forget the day of liberation.</sentence><sentence id="2672">And the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> rolled past, and everybody ran out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and everything, they were standing and they were waving and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2673">I remember soldiers sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2674">By the way, we were liberated, interestingly enough, by a Polish unit.</sentence><sentence id="2675">And everybody said, no, there were no Polish units in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2676">I was there this past spring, for the umpteenth time, I wanted to verify that, and I asked.</sentence><sentence id="2677">I said, everybody says that we couldn't have been liberated by a Polish unit, yet I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="2678">The nun said, yes, you are right.</sentence><sentence id="2679">We were liberated by Polish units.</sentence><sentence id="2680">These were Poles in exile who were supposed to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, but there was a problem for some reason, that they, and this was disputes between the liberating forces that, instead of going into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, there was a change made and they came into</sentence><sentence id="2682">1 <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to liberate.</sentence><sentence id="2683">See, politics play, always play into it.</sentence><sentence id="2684">So, it was a Polish unit.</sentence><sentence id="2685">Anyway, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> goes by, we're waving to the soldier, when he gets up to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, which was at the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, which had a white flag hanging out, from the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span>, because some Germans were holding up in there.</sentence><sentence id="2686">Something got thrown out of the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span>, there was an explosion, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> swiveled around, the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> slowed down, came back, the same soldier that we were just waving to, was laying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, all bloody.</sentence><sentence id="2687">I'll never, never forget that sight.</sentence><sentence id="2688">It would put such a damper, people say, oh, liberation, it was great, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2689">It was, and, and then fighting still broke out, even when we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2690">That when first, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V2</span>'s started coming.</sentence><sentence id="2691">They were the unmanned rockets that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was sending out.</sentence><sentence id="2692">That was when the Battle of the Bulge was started taking place.</sentence><sentence id="2693">I mean, it just as everybody thought things, this is it, finished.</sentence><sentence id="2694">It wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="2695">So, the little ones were in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3028">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3029">Things were still chaotic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3030">You had British troops, you had American troops.</sentence><sentence id="3031">People, at that point, there were no refugees coming back, yet, but you still had to keep running down into <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> because, as I said, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V2's</span> were flying over.</sentence><sentence id="3032">See, the war didn't end til "45.</sentence><sentence id="3033">So, there was a lot of, there was bombings, there was shootings, there were all kinds of things still happening.</sentence><sentence id="3034">Food was hard to come by, but the Jewish organization was already setting into place, and was the joint, as you say, Jewish immigrant, Hebrew immigrant society.</sentence><sentence id="3035">And they started to help Jews who were returning either from <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and then later on, of course, those who were coming back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3036">And, we also, one day mom was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and a British soldier walked over to her, I guess there must have been something about her, and he said to</sentence><sentence id="3038">5 her, Yiddish?</sentence><sentence id="3039">And she says, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3040">And, so he was like so excited that he saw a live Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3041">Came and brought her some food and all.</sentence><sentence id="3042">Eventually, and then, of course, Father Bruno, mom, now, I don't know how Father Bruno knew where we were living.</sentence><sentence id="3043">I think, probably, through the Mother Superior, somehow the contact was made, mamma, Father Bruno came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3044">You know, there are questions that, even though mom and I talked a lot, there are some questions that somehow never came up.</sentence><sentence id="3045">Because I, myself, didn't talk about this until about 1980.</sentence><sentence id="3046">I did go back to visit and everything, but I didn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="3047">I did not consider myself a survivor.</sentence><sentence id="3048">Because I had not been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3049">So, I deferred to, to me, survivors were those who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3050">And, not until 1980, when in, it was either "80 or "81, I was teaching at <span class="BUILDING">Einstein High School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kensington</span>, and a Social Studies teacher and I were in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and he pulled out a pamphlet, something from his mailbox, and, as we were walking down the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>, my eye fell on that pamphlet, and I say, let me take a look at that.</sentence><sentence id="3051">It was one of the first pamphlets that I had seen by, we call them the " revisionists, Alfred Butz(ph), out of Northwestern, when he had written a book, the hundred and twenty questions about the Holocaust that have never been answered, the Hoax of the Twentieth Century.</sentence><sentence id="3052">Well, there was this anger that came up.</sentence><sentence id="3053">And, I say, sure, it never happened.</sentence><sentence id="3054">So, where is everybody?</sentence><sentence id="3055">And that same day, I put a note in every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">teacher's mailbox</span> in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, identifying myself as a survivor for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="3056">And saying I'd be glad to come talk to their students.</sentence><sentence id="3057">And then later on, one of the teachers to whose <span class="BUILDING">class</span> I had spoken to, and who had done, then, a little unit on the Holocaust, had a swastika painted on her <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3058">So, she and I and a Social Studies teacher from Richard Montgomery, got together and decided, because they were both Social Studies.</sentence><sentence id="3059">I taught foreign language, I taught French and some German at the time.</sentence><sentence id="3060">So, their frustration was that, at that time, there was nothing on the Holocaust that you could use to teach in the textbooks.</sentence><sentence id="3061">There were maybe two <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3062">So, they were frustrated and I was.</sentence><sentence id="3063">So, the three of us got together</sentence><sentence id="3065">6 and we created a course.</sentence><sentence id="3066">We've been teaching for 11 years, the teachers.</sentence><sentence id="3067">We do teacher training.</sentence><sentence id="3068">So, that came out of this anger.</sentence><sentence id="3069">So, that's when, for the first time, I identified myself as a survivor.</sentence></p></dialogue>

also honored, I went to a Hannuka(ph) party where he was honored.</sentence><sentence id="3130">Just before he left, because he eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and to

Bruno, you've saved their lives, that's enough, I'm taking over now.</sentence><sentence id="3142">I'll handle it.</sentence><sentence id="3143">We'll be fine.</sentence><sentence id="3144">But, he did convince her, and he enrolled me in a <span class="BUILDING">catholic</span></sentence><sentence id="3146">7 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3147">I went back there this spring, as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="3148">But, I didn't know at the time, but I just learned now, is that his sister, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> belongs to the same order where his sister is a nun.</sentence><sentence id="3149">And she's still alive.</sentence><sentence id="3150">I saw her this spring.</sentence><sentence id="3151">I visited her.</sentence><sentence id="3152">I visited Father Bruno's brother, he has two siblings that are still alive.</sentence><sentence id="3153">And, he sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3154">I learned how to type.</sentence><sentence id="3155">Then I finally took, after I finished the pattern course, I went at night and learned how to do bookkeeping.</sentence><sentence id="3156">I was always trying to juggle and learn and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="3157">But, anyway, not only did I learn how to type, that was extracurricular, he had one of the nuns give me piano lessons.</sentence><sentence id="3158">I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, because he knew I loved music, but I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, so the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, it's still there, but it's a different, they do something different, it's not exactly the same type of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3159">Then, it was a regular, you know, you know, <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3160">The <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3161">And, in the morning before classes, they would leave the <span class="DLF">convent door</span> open and the <span class="DLF">parlor door</span> open, and I would go in and practice on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3162">Then I would go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and go to <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3163">And then, of course, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, immediately after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, there was typing and drawing lessons, which were extracurricular.</sentence><sentence id="3164">And I loved it, just absolutely loved it.</sentence><sentence id="3165">There was a slight problem, though.</sentence><sentence id="3166">Because, you see, we came from the Flemish part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I had been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Etervig(ph</span>), but I didn't exactly learn how to read and write in French.</sentence><sentence id="3167">I learned how to speak French.</sentence><sentence id="3168">And I didn't speak French until, learn French until we came, after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3169">So, that was another thing we dealt with.</sentence><sentence id="3170">Then we went back, Werselater(ph) was in the Flemish part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3171">So, then, by the time I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, most of the French was gone again, except for speaking a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="3172">So, I really had to learn how to read and write French.</sentence><sentence id="3173">So, at first, I just sat in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and then, slowly, anyway, to make a long story short, he did visit a couple of times.</sentence><sentence id="3174">And then, of course, he left.</sentence><sentence id="3175">And then I didn't see him again.</sentence><sentence id="3176">But I corresponded with him.</sentence><sentence id="3177">And, I did visit him</sentence><sentence id="3179">8 a few times before he left <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3180">I visited him a few times where he lived.</sentence><sentence id="3181">He was sort of like a surrogate father.</sentence><sentence id="3182">There was something, how can I explain, very, very special about the man.</sentence><sentence id="3183">He had these twinkling eyes and, you know something, everybody who knew or met Father Bruno, people who had been hidden by him and everything, tell me, when I say he had these twinkly eyes, they say, that was exactly it, that was Father Bruno.</sentence><sentence id="3184">I mean, it just, there was something about his face.</sentence><sentence id="3185">It was like goodness itself.</sentence><sentence id="3186">And I always asked him, you know, Father Bruno, you took such, you see, Father Bruno was betrayed.</sentence><sentence id="3187">Father Bruno had to get out of his habit and wear civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="3188">And yet, he continued doing what he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="3189">He his over 300 children.</sentence><sentence id="3190">And, he and Father Andre(ph), another priest, they stole virgin identity cards, and they stole municipal stamps and filled them in with the children's false names.</sentence><sentence id="3191">And then he had to go and get ration stamps with that.</sentence><sentence id="3192">And he had a collaborator there.</sentence><sentence id="3193">I mean, it was amazing the things he did.</sentence><sentence id="3194">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and, eventually, I dropped out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because mamma felt that the schooling wouldn't really do much for me.</sentence><sentence id="3195">That I really needed to learn a trade.</sentence><sentence id="3196">So, I became, I really learned how to be a dressmaker.</sentence><sentence id="3197">And, then through a soldier, we, who helped us, he, a British soldier, he helped find my father.</sentence><sentence id="3198">And one day, it was Christmas morning, I didn't know it at the time, of course, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3199">The doorbell rang and I, mamma said, run open the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I went to open the <span

oui.</sentence><sentence id="3202">And he says, Merry Christmas!</sentence><sentence id="3203">I didn't know what that meant.</sentence><sentence id="3204">I knew Noel at that point.</sentence><sentence id="3205">So, and he hands me a box.</sentence><sentence id="3206">And he leaves.</sentence><sentence id="3207">There was a letter taped to the top.</sentence><sentence id="3208">And, I'm standing there and all of a sudden I'm starting to yell out, mamma, mamma!</sentence><sentence id="3209">There was soldier here and he gave me a box.</sentence><sentence id="3210">And I run up with the box, because we lived on the second floor, and, nobody even looked at the letter, we opened the box.</sentence><sentence id="3211">A box.</sentence><sentence id="3212">It was filled with food.</sentence><sentence id="3213">Spam and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="3214">At that point, we ate everything.</sentence><sentence id="3215">Today I don't eat pork, but then, as long as we had food, who</sentence><sentence id="3217">9 cared what we ate?</sentence><sentence id="3218">And, then when we were full, we ended up being sick for several days, we overate.</sentence><sentence id="3219">But that was another story.</sentence><sentence id="3220">And, we read the letter and it was a letter from the <span class="BUILDING">American

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3683">Q: So, why don't you tell me about your trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, your arrival here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3685">A: Okay, when we arrived, we were met by two men.</sentence><sentence id="3686">At the Port of New York.</sentence><sentence id="3687">One was very tall, and one was, looked extremely small to me, much smaller than I had vaguely remembered, from what I had remembered, the little one was my father.</sentence><sentence id="3688">And I kept looking at him and saying, that's my father, that's my father, but I didn't feel that that was my father.</sentence><sentence id="3689">There wasn't any elation, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="3690">We were all so, don't forget, we were all so very tired from the journey.</sentence><sentence id="3691">And we, there wasn't a lull where there was sort of a period of time where we relaxed, were happy, all that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3692">Because there was a struggle and all that because we also had to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> all the way to Ovra(ph), and things weren't that comfortable either.</sentence><sentence id="3693">We got stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and there was a problem with me, I couldn't go onto my mother's passport.</sentence><sentence id="3694">And the Army was also, there was a question as to where could I be brought as a dependant, because I was past 14, somehow, at that time, for some reason, 14 was the cut-off date.</sentence><sentence id="3695">So, it was always, well, we'll let her go this far, and if they'll let her, pass her, fine, and it was all the way into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, that it was, okay, she can go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, I don't know if they'll let her off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3696">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="3697">But, anyway, I looked at him and it was very strange.</sentence><sentence id="3698">We then came out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was very dirty at that time, around the <span class="DLF">port</span> was a lot of garbage and everything, I remember, we didn't think we liked it.</sentence><sentence id="3699">He hugged each one of us, but I don't remember feeling the sense of family.</sentence><sentence id="3700">And then, I remember being angry.</sentence><sentence id="3701">I was angry.</sentence><sentence id="3702">Because I felt that, well, I had sort of absorbed my mother's anger, I think, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3703">Then we came, we were a large, see, dad had nothing when we got here.</sentence><sentence id="3704">Because he was so sure that his wife and children were killed.</sentence><sentence id="3705">That he didn't really prepare.</sentence><sentence id="3706">I guess he had formed sort of, I guess you can call that a depression or something, but, like, well, who should I really work for, kind of thing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3707">So, we moved into a <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor apartment</span>, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span>, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> on the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3710">6 whole way for four <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3711">And, we had hot water, but our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> was our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen counter</span> with a cover.</sentence><sentence id="3712">Take the cover off.</sentence><sentence id="3713">But, anyway, we settled in and, the children, the two children took to my dad pretty quickly.</sentence><sentence id="3714">Because they were still young and they were sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3715">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3716">I went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">sweatshop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3717">They called it a <span class="BUILDING">sweatshop</span>, it was actually, you know, they make the blazers.</sentence><sentence id="3718">And at night, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the <span class="BUILDING">Eron(ph) School</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3719">For business.</sentence><sentence id="3720">I think it still exists, on <span class="DLF">14th Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3721">And, I took English stenography.</sentence><sentence id="3722">I didn't really know English, but I took English stenography.</sentence><sentence id="3723">Because I figured, I knew by then French stenography, because that's another thing I had studied, I knew how to type.</sentence><sentence id="3724">I knew some bookkeeping.</sentence><sentence id="3725">So I took English stenography.</sentence><sentence id="3726">And I tried to kind of adjust into life.</sentence><sentence id="3727">Mom went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3728">She went and presented herself as a furrier, they fired her two days later, she was no furrier.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3729">Because she heard you could earn good money.</sentence><sentence id="3730">She learned something, she then got a job somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="3731">She got fired a week later, she learned something.</sentence><sentence id="3732">Within six months, mom was a furrier.</sentence><sentence id="3733">She then learned she can join the union, and you can earn more money that way, so she went, they said, yes, but you gotta picket a certain amount of time.</sentence><sentence id="3734">Guess who got elected to picket?</sentence><sentence id="3735">Me.</sentence><sentence id="3736">I picketed.</sentence><sentence id="3737">She joined the union.</sentence><sentence id="3738">She started earning good money.</sentence><sentence id="3739">And, we children were very unhappy living where we were living.</sentence><sentence id="3740">Even with the war and everything else, there was just, also, we had to learn English.</sentence><sentence id="3741">It was, they were difficult times.</sentence><sentence id="3742">And, she says, kids, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="3743">Because I wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3744">I wanted, at that point, I wanted to go back.</sentence><sentence id="3745">And, she says, don't worry, I'll have you out of here.</sentence><sentence id="3746">You'll be out of here within two years.</sentence><sentence id="3747">Within two years, mom had learned enough English to learn that, and dad, of course, they both worked and they were trying to save a little.</sentence><sentence id="3748">And learned that if you're a veteran, you can buy a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without a down payment, within two years we were established in a <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3749">That was mamma.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3795">A: Well, there were, there's no question.</sentence><sentence id="3796">We came, we didn't really know the language.</sentence><sentence id="3797">I had the privilege of having had five English lessons before we left.</sentence><sentence id="3798">Because we needed one person who could ask a few questions.</sentence><sentence id="3799">So, we, I had five English lessons, so I was elected to ask the questions, where is this and where is that.</sentence><sentence id="3800">So, that was the extent of my knowledge of English.</sentence><sentence id="3801">When we, we settled in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, as I said, within a week, mom was out looking for work.</sentence><sentence id="3802">And, so was I.We both got jobs.</sentence><sentence id="3803">Mom and I then talked and she says, you know what, it would be a good idea if you could learn again, maybe finish up learning how to make patterns and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="3804">So, I found out, with my five words of English, that there is a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the High School for Fashion Industries, or something to that effect.</sentence><sentence id="3805">I believe around <span class="DLF">23rd Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3806">I make my way there and I enroll myself in this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3807">And, as far, when it came to the dressmaking and those parts, I knew everything.</sentence><sentence id="3808">However, in the other classes, it was another story.</sentence><sentence id="3809">I didn't know the language, and I remember sitting in a class, and one day I was asked a question, and I couldn't, I tried to answer it and, of course, I had this deep accent, and my English, of course, was very poor, and I remember everybody laughing and I got very upset that one day.</sentence><sentence id="3810">And I just bust out crying and ran out.</sentence><sentence id="3811">The teacher came after me and, you know, brought me back into <span class="BUILDING">class</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3812">And then, time went on, I did very, I got several <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> credits from the things that I did know.</sentence><sentence id="3813">And then the principal called me in to her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she said that I could get a scholarship to the <span class="BUILDING">Fashion Institute</span></sentence><sentence id="3815">9 of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3816">I didn't know what a scholarship was.</sentence><sentence id="3817">I thought it had something to do with being a scholar, but I didn't feel like a scholar.</sentence><sentence id="3818">But, I didn't know what a scholar, I didn't know that a scholarship was, as I said in French, , which was money to attend a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3819">And, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told my mother and father that the principal said I could get a scholarship.</sentence><sentence id="3820">My father knew what a scholarship was.</sentence><sentence id="3821">But, he says, I'm a girl and a girl doesn't need that much education.</sentence><sentence id="3822">Then they discussed it, of course, with uncle and the uncle who sent his two daughters to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, didn't think that I needed it.</sentence><sentence id="3823">And, I was then pulled out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I went to work.</sentence><sentence id="3824">Period.</sentence><sentence id="3825">But I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Eron(ph) School</span> and took some more bookkeeping.</sentence><sentence id="3826">That I could do at night.</sentence><sentence id="3827">Then, I decided once I knew stenography, I would get a job and I applied for a job with an attorney.</sentence><sentence id="3828">Because I then learned that in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, it isn't very elegant to work in a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, that you have to work in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, to be, quote, something.</sentence><sentence id="3829">So, I applied to this attorney, I know stenography in French, I know stenography in English and I know how to type and I know bookkeeping.</sentence><sentence id="3830">And he dictates his first letter and I type up the letter, I was there for three days by then, and I wrote the word subpoena, S-A-B-E-N-A. That's the only subpoena I knew.</sentence><sentence id="3831">Whatever, that's the end of that job.</sentence><sentence id="3832">I then got another job.</sentence><sentence id="3833">And another job.</sentence><sentence id="3834">After awhile, my English improved because what happened is, I, as I said, I found teenagers very frivolous here.</sentence><sentence id="3835">So, I wasn't comfortable with them.</sentence><sentence id="3836">Adults really didn't want any part of me.</sentence><sentence id="3837">I wasn't considered an adult.</sentence><sentence id="3838">So, L isolated myself.</sentence><sentence id="3839">I worked and then in my free time, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and with a dictionary and books that I had asked the librarian to tell me what I should read, I taught myself English.</sentence><sentence id="3840">I didn't know a verb from and adjective for, or a topic sentence or anything like that, but I taught myself how to read English.</sentence><sentence id="3841">And I literally photographed linguistic structure.</sentence><sentence id="3842">Not realizing that it would come in handy later on.</sentence><sentence id="3843">And, eventually, I presented myself to M. Lowenstein(ph) &amp; Sons.</sentence><sentence id="3844">I believe the <span class="BUILDING">company</span> still exists.</sentence><sentence id="3845">As a bilingual secretary.</sentence><sentence id="3846">And, when I was asked if I had a high</sentence><sentence id="3848">0 school diploma, I said, of course.</sentence><sentence id="3849">And, I got the job, and I realized that I really didn't know a lot, so what I did is, nobody else in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> knew French, so I told my boss, I need a dictionary.</sentence><sentence id="3850">He brought me a dictionary and I took the work <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3851">I pretended to do it in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, I took the work <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I worked at night, brought the work back, and learned.</sentence><sentence id="3852">I ended up staying there until after I was married and I didn't leave until I was expecting my son.</sentence><sentence id="3853">I became a good bilingual secretary.</sentence><sentence id="3854">Of course, I felt bad I had lied by then, you know, but you had, the thing is, I did my work, I worked very hard.</sentence><sentence id="3855">Then after that, I just kept, basically, I worked.</sentence><sentence id="3856">I mean, literally, that was my life.</sentence><sentence id="3857">My <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my family and work.</sentence><sentence id="3858">Then for awhile there, my second child, my husband was promoted and I could be a homemaker for awhile, so I was a homemaker, but I wanted certain things, like music lessons with the best of teachers and everything that was good for my children, so I started using my dressmaking skills because I didn't want to leave the children because I didn't have parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I felt that my children should have a mother at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3859">But I wanted money.</sentence><sentence id="3860">So, I became a dressmaker again at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3861">And when the children were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I worked as a dressmaker.</sentence><sentence id="3862">Meanwhile, I became active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3863">We lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and there was no <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in my children's elementary school, so I volunteered to set one up.</sentence><sentence id="3864">I set up a <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3865">My husband had a decent job, but, I wanted more.</sentence><sentence id="3866">And I told him to leave his job and go and try out for another one.</sentence><sentence id="3867">And his father said, no, you have a job, you stay put, you don't go chasing after birds in the <span class="DLF">sky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3868">And I said there's only one way, I said, we're young, we can do it, well anyway, time went on and we made it.</sentence><sentence id="3869">And then, but meanwhile, I never had a high school diploma.</sentence><sentence id="3870">When my son was, there were two incidents that drove me to improve myself in other <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3871">One of them was, I still had a fairly deep accent and I didn't realize to what degree because my husband never said anything.</sentence><sentence id="3872">Once in awhile people would kind of make fun, but by that time, it didn't bother me that much.</sentence><sentence id="3873">One day my little one came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from first grade crying.</sentence><sentence id="3874">And I</sentence><sentence id="3876">1 thought somebody had beaten him up, and he said, please, mommy, when you come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, don't talk.</sentence><sentence id="3877">Everybody says you talk funny.</sentence><sentence id="3878">So, my child wasn't going to be an outsider, so I started working with my husband and improving my accent, that's why I have a New York accent.</sentence><sentence id="3879">And fighting my accent, that was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="3880">Then one day, I realized that someday the children are going to ask me if I have, if mamma has a high school diploma.</sentence><sentence id="3881">And I didn't want to have to lie to my children.</sentence><sentence id="3882">So, I went to see my, but, you know, there was one element in all this, is that I, basically, I was very much of a loner.</sentence><sentence id="3883">I did things.</sentence><sentence id="3884">Like, I, as I said, I became part of the community, I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, I, at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I volunteered, I became a den mother and all that, but, yet, I was a loner.</sentence><sentence id="3885">I had no time for friendships.</sentence><sentence id="3886">But, I think it wasn't so much that I had no time, I think I had become so comfortable going my own way, going all the way back when the children laughed at me after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I isolated myself.</sentence><sentence id="3887">I worked and started teaching myself English.</sentence><sentence id="3888">That it became a pattern.</sentence><sentence id="3889">In fact, I'm still accused of being a workaholic.</sentence><sentence id="3890">I'm supposed to be retired, but I work all the time.</sentence><sentence id="3891">And I think you develop a pattern.</sentence><sentence id="3892">But, anyway, I went to see my little girl's kindergarten teacher and I said, look, this is between us, I want to tell you something, maybe you can help me.</sentence><sentence id="3893">See, because I had talked to my husband, my husband kept saying, Flora, you're a smart girl, you don't have to prove anything to anybody, you don't need it.</sentence><sentence id="3894">But, I wanted it.</sentence><sentence id="3895">So, she says, you can get a high school diploma two ways.</sentence><sentence id="3896">She says, I know they are giving some exams at <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> to veterans.</sentence><sentence id="3897">You can get what they call a General Education Diploma.</sentence><sentence id="3898">Or, she says, you can take <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3899">She says, but, you know what, why don't you take the test, if you fail it, you'll take classes.</sentence><sentence id="3900">So, I went and I took the exam and, it was, after that, it was a series of exams.</sentence><sentence id="3901">And I took them and then I was supposed to come back to find out the results and, I get a diploma.</sentence><sentence id="3902">And I'll never forget, the man who handed it to me says, well, Mrs. Singer, what are you going to do with this?</sentence><sentence id="3903">What am I going to do with this?</sentence><sentence id="3904">Who's</sentence><sentence id="3906">2 going to be my equal?</sentence><sentence id="3907">I've got a high school diploma!</sentence><sentence id="3908">You know?</sentence><sentence id="3909">So, by then my husband was more successful, we were able to live in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already, you know, things like that.</sentence><sentence id="3910">So, that, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="3911">We went out to dinner, he was so proud of me and all

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4133">Q: So, do you think your husband was right, that you had this compelling need to prove yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4135">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4136">It's a good question.</sentence><sentence id="4137">Because what happened, what's interesting, my husband is the one who changed, not me.</sentence><sentence id="4138">What happened was, after the surprise party, I didn't know, but he had gotten some tickets to take me on a vacation.</sentence><sentence id="4139">And, being I had been so busy between helping him and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and studying, and all, and taking care of the children still, even though they were adolescents now, he kept complaining.</sentence><sentence id="4140">See, the thing is, he kept complaining throughout the years that I was going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, we couldn't go out because I had to study for tests or write a paper or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4141">But, anyway, this was it.</sentence><sentence id="4142">I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I had gone out shopping to get a few clothes for my vacation.</sentence><sentence id="4143">And I get a phone call and it was Jack, and he says, my husband, he says, Flora, are you standing or sitting down?</sentence><sentence id="4144">I says, why, who died, who got hurt?</sentence><sentence id="4145">Anyone got hurt?Anyone sick?</sentence><sentence id="4146">He says, why does it always have to be bad news?</sentence><sentence id="4147">He says, no, sit down if you're standing.</sentence><sentence id="4148">And, so I sat down, he says, how would you like to go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> and teach at the</sentence><sentence id="4150">4 <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4151">I said, what?</sentence><sentence id="4152">He says, yes, they waived the GRE's and you can go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, not only aren't you going to have to pay, they're going to pay you, and you'll teach.</sentence><sentence id="4153">I said, well, I can't do that to you, I said, you know, it's not fair.</sentence><sentence id="4154">He says, how can you refuse it?Meanwhile, that same week what had happened is, a friend of mine had bought out a, actually, no, she hadn't bought it out yet, she had gotten a job as a guide, a tour guide.</sentence><sentence id="4155">And they offered me a job also, because of my linguistic skills.</sentence><sentence id="4156">And I had accepted it, but I hadn't gone down yet to get fingerprinted for the license and all that, and I said, and not only that, I said, I already promised to take this job.</sentence><sentence id="4157">He says, Flora, how can you compare the two?</sentence><sentence id="4158">How can you, you can't turn it down.</sentence><sentence id="4159">I says, but, Jack, do you know what that means?</sentence><sentence id="4160">That means again, homework, and papers and all that, I says, I won't be able to go out.</sentence><sentence id="4161">He said, so what?</sentence><sentence id="4162">So, anyway, I went back to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, I taught at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span> three years.</sentence><sentence id="4163">And then they offered me a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4164">And, I took it and then my husband talked me out of it because he felt it was just such a big trip to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="4165">And, I sent a vitae to the <span class="BUILDING">local colleges</span>, but then, a friend of my husband who works in the <span class="REGION">county</span>, they needed a French teacher at <span class="BUILDING">Einstein High School</span>, called, said they had an opening, would I take it?</sentence><sentence id="4166">I said, me teach <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4167">My husband says, look I know you, come September you're going to be unhappy if you don't do anything, he says.</sentence><sentence id="4168">So, I took the job and a few days after I had, after I had signed the contract, I got an offer, there was a position at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span>, part-time.</sentence><sentence id="4169">But, of course, I had signed the contract.</sentence><sentence id="4170">And I loved working with the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids.</sentence><sentence id="4171">It was like, literally, a fish going into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4172">I just loved working with the kids, and I stayed.</sentence><sentence id="4173">Stayed with <span class="COUNTRY">Britannia</span> and ended up retiring from Walt Whitman High School.</sentence><sentence id="4174">And some nice things happened to me, too.</sentence><sentence id="4175">I ended up going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span> as what they call a master learner, there was a special program.</sentence><sentence id="4176">And I just went to a wedding of one of my former students.</sentence><sentence id="4177">From <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4178">I ended up going to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> on their program that I was selected for on a</sentence><sentence id="4180">5 grant because of something I had written, comparative study of Shakespeare and French literature.</sentence><sentence id="4181">So, some real nice things happened.</sentence><sentence id="4182">Did they just happen?</sentence><sentence id="4183">Did I need to prove?</sentence><sentence id="4184">I don't know if I needed to prove myself.</sentence><sentence id="4185">I don't remember thinking, ever, that I needed to prove myself.</sentence><sentence id="4186">There isn't, I don't remember there being an ego.</sentence><sentence id="4187">There is ego now, because I say, yeah, I really did all these things.</sentence><sentence id="4188">But, I don't remember thinking about needing to prove.</sentence><sentence id="4189">It was always for the children, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4432">A: It does.</sentence><sentence id="4433">Well, I do fear whenever you have, like when Farakan(ph) spoke .</sentence><sentence id="4434">I knew I was safe and all that, but such fear that someone who could mobilize people can take another people, perhaps, and mobilize this mass against others.</sentence><sentence id="4435">And that's a fear that's never gone away.</sentence><sentence id="4436">Because even with Hitler, there are many things, even I sometimes tend to want to say, yeah, I'd like a little more order.</sentence><sentence id="4437">I'd like less violence.</sentence><sentence id="4438">Let's, you know, , and then I say, no, we can't, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4439">Because there's always seemingly something good in an authoritarian kind of a setting.</sentence><sentence id="4440">But...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4460">A: But, I respect those who believe in Catholicism or any other religion.</sentence><sentence id="4461">And, as I say to youngsters, when I speak to them, I say, had I been born a Catholic, I would've been proud to be a Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="4462">Had I been born a Hindu, I would have been proud to be a Hindu.</sentence><sentence id="4463">Because each <span class="BUILDING">religion</span> does teach some good things.</sentence><sentence id="4464">It's the way we twist those things.</sentence><sentence id="4465">And...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4472">Q: But you must have some feeling about Catholicism.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4474">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="4475">Let me, I used to question, there are some things I can't accept because I have been so strongly Jewish before I ever went into the <span class="BUILDING">convents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4476">So, even though there was this attraction, the Mother Superior has said I have promised to come back and become a nun, and I'm still sometimes</sentence><sentence id="4478">9 accused of, for a nice Jewish girl, being a, I could easily be a nun.</sentence><sentence id="4479">Not, why I don't know, that's another, you know, thing.</sentence><sentence id="4480">But, I did question the Mother Superior a lot and one day, I'll never forget this, she said to me, she says, Flora, faith is beyond us.</sentence><sentence id="4481">It's above our heads, let's just pray to God to be able to believe, she says, but don't worry about it, she says, there's one God in <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> and different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ladders</span> to reach him.</sentence><sentence id="4482">And each religion is one of those <span class="DLF">ladders</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4483">Now, this coming from a nun.</sentence><sentence id="4484">Father Bruno, when he gave a child into hiding, said, this child is not to be converted.</sentence><sentence id="4485">That doesn't mean that some overzealous people didn't try, but he said, this child is not to be converted.</sentence><sentence id="4486">Our job is to save their lives, we don't, you know, their soul doesn't belong to us.</sentence><sentence id="4487">A true Christian, to me, is the one who practices religion, who does what you're supposed to do, but...</sentence></p></dialogue>
