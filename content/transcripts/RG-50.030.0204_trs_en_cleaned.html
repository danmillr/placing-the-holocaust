Well around the corner.</sentence><sentence id="99">It was in a part of the <span class="DLF">street</span> called, oddly enough, means beautiful <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">It wasn't nothing very beautiful about that <span class="DLF">street</span>, but the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> was called at the time.</sentence><sentence id="101">And I remember the first...I was a person...uh...not very independent, probably as a result of the kind of education of the upbringing.</sentence><sentence id="102">As I said, I was over-protected, and...uh...it was difficult for me to separate myself from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">But...uh...I remember vividly on one of the first days, the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I remember the name of Pakoni lifted me on to his knee and I can see his friendly face.</sentence><sentence id="104">He was a person of Czech extraction, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="105">Uh...so he spoke a perfect German.</sentence><sentence id="106">I suspect that he might even have been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">But, of course, you know, the Austrian empire at the time incorporated...uh... No, it had incorporated.</sentence><sentence id="108">At that time when I was born and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslavakia</span> was already an independent <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">But before that it was part of the <span class="COUNTRY">empire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">Uh...So he took me on his knee and he asked me whom I loved more, my mother or him.</sentence><sentence id="111">I was intensely embarrassed.</sentence><sentence id="112">I'm telling this story to show that...uh...uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was a place of mixed emotions for me.</sentence><sentence id="113">Anti-Semitism was endemic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> but there were loving persons, of course.</sentence><sentence id="114">There were individuals who and I did experience affection and love from some of them.</sentence><sentence id="115">As a matter of fact, when he asked me this question, the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and Mother came in. (</sentence><sentence id="116">Laughter) So that just adds to my embarrassment. (</sentence><sentence id="117">Laughter) I don't know how I wiggled out of that one.</sentence><sentence id="118">Subsequently, we had a...a teacher by the name of Kanote.</sentence><sentence id="119">Uh...and...uh...she also singled me out as...uh...I guess I am...I am really sorry to say as one of her preferred students</sentence><sentence id="121">because I don't like this whole business of really singling out anybody.</sentence><sentence id="122">I am today for instance Professor at <span class="BUILDING">Rutgers University</span> and...uh...1 am very much guided by...uh...maybe this experience and others that...uh...that I just like all my students.</sentence><sentence id="123">I like all the kids there.</sentence><sentence id="124">Uh...But in any case, she had...she had the Jewish pets and the Gentile pets.</sentence><sentence id="125">I was the Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="126">The Gentile was a fellow by the name of who is the son of policeman.</sentence><sentence id="127">I remember all these <span class="NPIP">things</span> so..so..so vividly.</sentence><sentence id="128">Uh...The reason I mention this again was to show you a little bit of the atmosphere there.</sentence><sentence id="129">Uh...And I remember one occasion when...uh...she would sometimes go out because I think that...uh...she had a bit of a flirt going with a...with another teacher by the name of Flashman in the class.</sentence><sentence id="130">And she asked me to monitor the class.</sentence><sentence id="131">And as soon as she left, the class broke out into some kind of rowdy behavior and I immediately was able somehow to control that and what I learned about myself instinctively, you know, and I only recall this on reflection now...was that in....in times of tension and so, I seemed to have...to...to psychologically understand ways of controlling myself, of being in...in complete possession of myself and consequently of the situation and it was something that stood me in good stead when the Nazis came in.</sentence><sentence id="132">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Where were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: I was...I was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>...in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in 186 204.</sentence><sentence id="248">That was the first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the left side...uh...as you came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and stepped up quite a number of steps.</sentence><sentence id="249">Uh...And I listed to...uh...his speech and do...do recall..-uh...some of the words he said.</sentence><sentence id="250">I believe he said To the death with red, white red, which is the color of the Austrian flag.</sentence><sentence id="251">Red, white, red.</sentence><sentence id="252">Uh...At least my memory tells me that he said the things that he said.</sentence><sentence id="253">And...uh...Fritzi Shumberger, that maid, and my brother next to me (clearing throat) Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="254">Guess I'll have to drink something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: That's fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: (Drinking water) Uh...My brother Leo.</sentence><sentence id="269">He was the next oldest.</sentence><sentence id="270">I was the youngest in a family of four which was also was a kind of situation that...uh...had me on my guard most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="271">And...and what separated me from the next one was a period of 6 years, very substantial.</sentence><sentence id="272">But the other three...uh...were only separated in terms of 2 years and there was... So really there were two families.</sentence><sentence id="273">It was they and I. I always regarded myself as an outsider and I expect it was because of that large separation of time.</sentence><sentence id="274">Anyway, Leo was there and Fritzi and she said something, "Oh wonderful and so on and so forth."</sentence><sentence id="275">Uh...Because obviously, I think she was going out with somebody who was a Nazi and they...they were very joyful about Hitler coming in.</sentence><sentence id="276">As a matter of fact, many Austrians were....uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="287">I'm confused.</sentence><sentence id="288">Who was joyful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Fritzi Shumberger, our... our maid was very joyful about it and many Austrians were.</sentence><sentence id="293">In any case...uh...and my brother remarked...he made some kind of...uh...negative remark about it, saying that...uh...,you know, there may not be that much reason to be happy.</sentence><sentence id="294">I...In any case...I do...I do remember that.</sentence><sentence id="295">I also remember the next day looking out.</sentence><sentence id="296">First of all, there were...there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> going...coming overhead.</sentence><sentence id="297">Hugh, hugh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>, droning and very low, almost...uh...scraping the...the...the tops...the tops of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">Black, black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">They looked black to me or maybe that's just a psychological memory.</sentence><sentence id="300">Uh...And every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was draped with a spastic of flags.</sentence><sentence id="301">Every <span class="BUILDING">house</span>!</sentence><sentence id="302">And these were hugh flags.</sentence><sentence id="303">I am talking about <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span>, five floors.</sentence><sentence id="304">And these were flags that...that went from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> right almost down to the...to the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and I should imagine that...uh...there was a very active, highly organized Nazi underground movement.</sentence><sentence id="305">And they distributed all these these flags over night.</sentence><sentence id="306">Also, there were many Nazis in all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">There was a substantial proportion of Austrians and Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="308"><span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> has always...uh... managed to portray itself only as the victim and I have to say most emphatically...and I don't want to be unjust to the many people in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> who were good people and kind people...but there was a large population of haters in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">And I don't think there was a single <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world that embraced Hitler so fervently as the Austrian nation.</sentence><sentence id="310">And those of us who were there know it, experienced it.</sentence><sentence id="311">Uh... do remember that...uh...somehow or other I managed to either to allow my mother to go out or slip...I probably slipped out.</sentence><sentence id="312">And I went pretty far afield because I found myself...uh...and this was probably not on the first week.</sentence><sentence id="313">It was probably some weeks after the entry.</sentence><sentence id="314">But it was a time when...when Hitler...uh...was...uh...uh...going around in a procession.</sentence><sentence id="315">I remember him...1 remember him standing in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor car</span>, standing upright.</sentence><sentence id="316">It was an open...uh... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">And the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> were thronged with people.</sentence><sentence id="318">I mean there was just one mass of people all waving and shouting and...and...and jubilant.</sentence><sentence id="319">Uh...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A: I...L...I'll tell you that.</sentence><sentence id="834">Probably...Actually...we actually went to our sister.</sentence><sentence id="835">If my

id="837">But we...we lived with our sister for the...for the last 2 or 3 months...uh...Uh...What happened there was that I had...whatever money we had left...1 don't know whether at that time we had already lost the business or not, but in any case, there was</sentence><sentence id="839">0 little business and people wouldn't pay us anyway even if we supplied.</sentence><sentence id="840">Uh...So we had no money coming in and so we had a substantial business but you know as a businessman, we weren't that rich.</sentence><sentence id="841">We had some money left to pay for expenses to move out or what, but whatever money we had left was our lifeline for escape.</sentence><sentence id="842">And I had become extremely adept at hiding things and at finding things.</sentence><sentence id="843">And the reason why I had become adept was that, as I told you, I was a book worm and I would read through <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="844">I mean literally shelf after shelf cause I remember my mother would take me to a <span class="BUILDING">worker's library</span> in this, I believe they called them, you know.</sentence><sentence id="845">The

and <span class="DLF">gardens</span> inside.</sentence><sentence id="848">It was really a splendid world.</sentence><sentence id="849">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="850">And they had these <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, and my mother would take me there and for me this was a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">And actually as I remember, they were really little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, but the glorious thing was there was these bookcases and they were stacked with books from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and I knew that each book was a world.</sentence><sentence id="852">And it just entranced me.</sentence><sentence id="853">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="854">And I would read indiscriminately, but they were mostly good books.</sentence><sentence id="855">They were...at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> also we had, our <span class="BUILDING">saloon</span> was stacked.</sentence><sentence id="856">We had all the classics.</sentence><sentence id="857">At that time we had paperbacks also the crown books they were called.</sentence><sentence id="858">That was before the Penguins.</sentence><sentence id="859">And I knew all the classics and I knew the Russians and the French, the dossiers and all these people.</sentence><sentence id="860">But my mother used to hide books from me that were classics even because they were too serious.</sentence><sentence id="861">For instance,...uh...and what an innocent world it was at the time, for instance...uh...and , Crime and Punishment.</sentence><sentence id="862">I am mentioning this because it later on plays actually a role.</sentence><sentence id="863">However, there was no place they could hide a book that I didn't find.</sentence><sentence id="864">And...uh...the most peculiar <span class="NPIP">place</span> that my mother found was the stove pipe, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">saloon</span> and I found that too because I always...I put myself in her <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="865">Now where...where would I hide something.</sentence><sentence id="866">A book...a book isn't such a small object you see.</sentence><sentence id="867">So I became extremely skilled in nosing out things, where they might be hidden, and hiding things.</sentence><sentence id="868">And I was the person consequently selected...you see how negative qualities become virtues in a world that's gone crazy...to hide whatever money we had left.</sentence><sentence id="869">And what I did, and that was just before our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was ransacked and sealed, was...uh...we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brass beds</span> which had hollow legs and you could unscrew the...uh...the wheels.</sentence><sentence id="870">So I stuffed some money up there in the legs and then we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">curtain rods</span> that were also brass.</sentence><sentence id="871">Hugh things!</sentence><sentence id="872">And I stuffed some money there.</sentence><sentence id="873">Actually, you could only get them out with very, very long thin stick.</sentence><sentence id="874">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="875">The Nazis, however, who were never book worms, never learned...uh...to learn to look..to look for things (laughter), you know, in those little <span class="NPIP">hollow hiding places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="876">And they never found the money.</sentence><sentence id="877">Now, then the <span

in mind that these were heavy reinforced <span class="DLF">doors</span> with not only massive...uh...wood, but also not the kind of plywood that is used now, but genuine oak or something like, but also...uh...uh...steel bars inside.</sentence><sentence id="1171">There's a whole...there's a whole <span class="DLF">steel door</span> inside.</sentence><sentence id="1172">So these were <span

there.</sentence><sentence id="1185">I believe he must have been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And...uh...my brother-in- law had been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1187">My...my sister

through terrible time there.</sentence><sentence id="1189">In any case, when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, something strange happened.</sentence><sentence id="1190">I mean I was always the youngster, the kid and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1191">And now L...I was the only man.</sentence><sentence id="1192">And I don't know whether this is some genetics or the biology of relatives, I just...I...the diffident, the shy, the book worm and so on, assumed control quite naturally and I said, "If somebody comes, we won't open the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1193">We just don't open."</sentence><sentence id="1194">And this...well, my sister was always a person...my sister was not a person who was very assertive.</sentence><sentence id="1195">In any case, she would have taken a rather quiet role in the background.</sentence><sentence id="1196">But my mother was a very courageous person.</sentence><sentence id="1197">But I think as a result of all that had happened...of</sentence><sentence id="1199">4 what happened to Father...of the fact that both of them were arrested, she became...she was very quiet and she just accepted...uh...my suggestion without any demurring.</sentence><sentence id="1200">Well, we didn't have to wait long.</sentence><sentence id="1201">Shortly after, it was before lunch time, we heard these...uh...very well known...uh... boots beating on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they weren't just beating on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, generally accompanied by shouts...open up this that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1202">We didn't open.</sentence><sentence id="1203">And I think probably...I have gone through some different phases in my life, but this must have been one of them because...uh... we tiptoed into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and so as not to be seen from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> or so we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span>, but the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was built around the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and you could have looked in from the opposite <span class="NPIP">wing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1204">So we had to stand pressed against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And my sister had to put her hand on the mouth of the baby.</sentence><sentence id="1206">It was a 2 month old baby.</sentence><sentence id="1207">And always be afraid that either she might stifle her inadvertently or that the baby would cry.</sentence><sentence id="1208">And here these men were battering on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you know, with the jack boots you can subject a <span class="DLF">door</span> to some treatment and it went on, it seemed to me, for an eternity.</sentence><sentence id="1209">And what went through my mind was the scene of in Crime and Punishment.</sentence><sentence id="1210">was a criminal.</sentence><sentence id="1211">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="1212">But nonetheless, it was a scene of the most...and they were standing there in, I believe in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, after having committed the deed, and they hear some...some steps going up and then the <span class="DLF">door</span> rattling and he is afraid that the lock might...might open up because...uh...this...uh...was just some...some kind of...uh... what do you call it in English?</sentence><sentence id="1213">It's...uh...we call it a..[t wasn't...it wasn't

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1293">A: Uh...And that scene flashed through my mind because I was always living half in the book and half <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1294">And then we...and we could hear everything that was going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then...uh...one man said to the other...apparently, he was the leader of the group.</sentence><sentence id="1295">He said to the other, "or whatever the name was, Go down and fetch a <span class="DLF">crow bar</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1296">And this fellow went down.</sentence><sentence id="1297">And, of course, our...way back...uh...was closed.</sentence><sentence id="1298">We couldn't open.</sentence><sentence id="1299">They would have thrown us out the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1300">At that moment, the <span class="DLF">door</span> from a neighboring <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> opened and there was a woman... I had never spoken to her.</sentence><sentence id="1301">Mother had never spoken to her.</sentence><sentence id="1302">I don't know whether my daughter knew her.</sentence><sentence id="1303">She was a Gentile obviously.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And she said, "You know, I saw them go out about a hour ago.</sentence><sentence id="1305">You're wasting your time"...or words to that effect.</sentence><sentence id="1306">You could hear everything in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1307">You could hear things through the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1308">And they went away.</sentence><sentence id="1309">And in the afternoon, they came back.</sentence><sentence id="1310">And, of course, I had said, "Look.</sentence><sentence id="1311">They come back in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="1312">We open immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1313">I don't want to go through this again."</sentence><sentence id="1314">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="1315">So when they came, we opened straight away.</sentence><sentence id="1316">But I, you know, my temper was...was sort of moving up, you know, again and I decided that I was going to sit at...uh... the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffee table</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">saloon</span>...uh...drinking a cup of coffee or tea or whatever was there as if...uh... 1 couldn't care a damn about what was going on, just to show my disdain, you understand.</sentence><sentence id="1317">I thought that this would make a significant impression.</sentence><sentence id="1318">I was really, you know, half serious, half child...uh.</sentence><sentence id="1319">And that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="1320">And they came in and my sister had...uh...a side <span class="DLF">porch</span>, you know with <span class="DLF">sliding glass doors</span> and she displayed all kinds of...uh...lots of precious things...porcelain, crystal...uh...the things that you got for our wedding...uh...heirlooms, stuff of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="1321">And, of course, they were after it.</sentence><sentence id="1322">And one of the Nazis, a kind of clumsy fellow, who had never handled <span class="DLF">doors</span> like this tried to open and he sort of fumbled around and he</sentence><sentence id="1324">5 couldn't figure out how this...this <span class="DLF">door</span> opened.</sentence><sentence id="1325">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="1326">Because the only <span class="DLF">door</span> probably that he...he got to know was the <span class="DLF">door</span> on hinges.</sentence><sentence id="1327">And I could see him sort of...1 could almost read his mind...and holding his foot, his leg up in order to kick the <span class="DLF">door</span> in, and I jumped up.</sentence><sentence id="1328">Yal.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And confronted him as much as I could confront him.</sentence><sentence id="1330">I mean my head was probably the height of his breast bone.</sentence><sentence id="1331">And I said you know...and I again remember the words verbatim...there are two ways of opening this <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1332">I said, "One is you lift your leg and kick it in like that, and I just imitated what he was doing, and the other one is like this and I put out one little finger and I just made the <span class="DLF">door</span> open.</sentence><sentence id="1333">And don't you think that's a better way.</sentence><sentence id="1334">And I looked him in the face and he looked back and no words were exchanged...no further word was exchanged between us.</sentence><sentence id="1335">And, of course, they packed all the stuff up and took it away and walked out.</sentence><sentence id="1336">And that was another visit.</sentence><sentence id="1337">It was the most terrible because of what happened in the morning and that could have easily ended up, as I say, with our flying out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1338">Uh...If you don't mind, a few things occur to me.</sentence><sentence id="1339">I want to go back to them.</sentence><sentence id="1340">First of all (clearing throat), there was first of all two...two personal encounters and...uh...that I think of.</sentence><sentence id="1341">Uh...I had...I told you before that I had...I had learned in some way that in certain critical situations I could face up to things and somehow assert control.</sentence><sentence id="1342">It was almost a kind of...uh...psychological insight...some...some measure of certainty that I had at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1343">Some...some voice that came to me from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> myself.</sentence><sentence id="1344">And I remember that one of the times it happened was even before the Nazis came in.</sentence><sentence id="1345">Uh...It was winter time and I was dressed...uh...in a very nice winter coat.</sentence><sentence id="1346">It was a new coat.</sentence><sentence id="1347">with a herringbone and a velvet collar.</sentence><sentence id="1348">And here was a much bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> but ragged, obviously from very poor circumstances who came up and our steps met at the corner and I knew that he wasn't going to shake my hands.</sentence><sentence id="1349">I realized that he was gonna beat me up.</sentence><sentence id="1350">And I always had empathy for the underdog.</sentence><sentence id="1351">I had a very, very strong empathy.</sentence><sentence id="1352">I had really always a strong heart for poor people, for animals, for all things of that sort, and I felt ashamed actually of my...of our circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="1353">Even so, God knows,,...uh...I was luxuriating my...the presence of the coat with normally books, you know, or games of skills.</sentence><sentence id="1354">They never bought me a model set because I might break my leg or something, which I probably would have (chuckle) if they bought me one.</sentence><sentence id="1355">But I always had that...that feeling that...uh...I felt uncomfortable of having more than somebody else and so | didn't have to fake anything.</sentence><sentence id="1356">I...I really had an understanding for him and a feeling for him.</sentence><sentence id="1357">And it may have been this fact that sort of edged away fear because it took the place of
