id="191">So they came and they said that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morava</span>, they needed to send 500 young boys.</sentence><sentence id="192">As it were, we had to provide those 500 young boys.</sentence><sentence id="193">So it was a very hard thing for the Jewish community to go around and say, "Look, you have a boy.</sentence><sentence id="194">I want him to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>."</sentence><sentence id="195">Which we did not know if they are going to come back.</sentence><sentence id="196">Because they took us all the way down to the <span

there, so they had to cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, around the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">So they cut up the -- they cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> out for about 100 or 200 feet away from the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>, so they should be able to see.</sentence><sentence id="206">This is the type of work that we had.</sentence><sentence id="207">And cleaning the <span class="DLF">roads</span>, which I was there.</sentence><sentence id="208">I worked from early in the morning till late at night with one piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="209">And I have seen with my own eyes like people were just standing there, and within a minute you saw them falling down and being stiff, because it was -- the temperature was 20, 25 below zero.</sentence><sentence id="210">So I was just lucky, I had some good clothing.</sentence><sentence id="211">And then I was young.</sentence><sentence id="212">Just young, that is good to do -- do whatever.</sentence><sentence id="213">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the depression had set in.</sentence><sentence id="214">I had seen so many people that did not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and they would always ask me, "Did you see this boy?</sentence><sentence id="215">Did you see that boy?"</sentence><sentence id="216">And I knew that he is dead, but how can you say that to somebody?</sentence><sentence id="217">That maybe they took him away and he's going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">But it was a frightening situation.</sentence><sentence id="219">The life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> proper was a -- you were living with hope.</sentence><sentence id="220">I personally am an optimist.</sentence><sentence id="221">With every day that passed, I said maybe God will help.</sentence><sentence id="222">Maybe something will come of it, and maybe somehow we will escape.</sentence><sentence id="223">But during the wintertime, we suffered tremendously because during the wintertime, you had the sickness.</sentence><sentence id="224">Typhoid fever with spots, that was tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="225">It took about two weeks if a person got sick with that sickness.</sentence><sentence id="226">Which I was sick with it, I was sick for two weeks with about 104 temperature, 105.</sentence><sentence id="227">And then there was like a crisis, and if you remained alive, a lot of people developed all kinds of sicknesses with their eyes.</sentence><sentence id="228">Even I have a complication of the inflammation of the veins on both legs.</sentence><sentence id="229">And I was sick for about six weeks during the wintertime after that.</sentence><sentence id="230">And thank God I escaped and I came through.</sentence><sentence id="231">Doctors didn't have any medications. "</sentence><sentence id="232">The only medication," he says, "I could give you is pray.</sentence><sentence id="233">Pray to God.</sentence><sentence id="234">I have nothing to give you.</sentence><sentence id="235">If you are strong, if you have a strong heart, you'll be able to live."</sentence><sentence id="236">And that advice, what can I tell you?</sentence><sentence id="237">Thank God I came through it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
