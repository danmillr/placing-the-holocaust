He, as I said before, he was a barber.</sentence><sentence id="147">He worked in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in his own <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">So food, we had enough.</sentence><sentence id="149">He used to bring in from the peasants who -- those years, they didn't have those shaving things that you shave yourself and you threw it away.</sentence><sentence id="150">I mean, they had to come to a <span class="BUILDING">barber</span> to take a shave, and to take a haircut.</sentence><sentence id="151">As a matter of fact, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, the war in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, my father worked in his own <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> for the Germans, because they needed him for this particular reasons.</sentence><sentence id="152">They couldn't shave themselves, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="153">They needed a barber.</sentence><sentence id="154">And after six months being in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they told us that we're going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and this is where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>'s going to be.</sentence><sentence id="155">Where there were two <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, so they took up the area of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and they, they, segregated with barbed wire -- it was extremely tall barbed wires -- and a peasant next-door neighbor came.</sentence><sentence id="156">My father told him to and asked him &gt;The Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lachva</span> on July 8, 1941."The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lachva</span> was established on April 1, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="158">to, and they came and they put us, whatever little belongings -- we took very little, and they put us in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, we were six people, and I was walking.</sentence><sentence id="159">I didn't want to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">I remember when I left my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I looked back and I cried my -- as little as I was, as young as I was, I knew I'll never come back.</sentence><sentence id="161">I cried my eyes out.</sentence><sentence id="162">And we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">I mean, one of my -- my father requested it, that they gave it to us just because he worked in this <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span>, and he knew a lot of German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="165">So they gave us -- there were two families in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, very small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And we slept like two, three in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">We were six people, and there was another other two people, also a barber, but only two people.</sentence><sentence id="168">There was no family, they elderly people.</sentence><sentence id="169">And my mother never took me down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">I never saw how the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> looked.</sentence><sentence id="171">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for about ... at least 20 families, 15 families.</sentence><sentence id="172">So I guess they didn't want children there just to take up the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">And there was really nothing much to cook there, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="174">Whatever, as far as I could remember, whatever my father used to smuggle in through the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, because in the morning he used to go to work, come back at night, as a barber.</sentence><sentence id="175">So he used to hide on him something, because you, you were not allowed to smuggle in any food.</sentence><sentence id="176">So he used to hide, let's say a piece of fish or a piece of bread, or a piece of potato to smuggle in, they shouldn't see it on him.</sentence><sentence id="177">And this we lived on.</sentence><sentence id="178">And then I saw my mother was swollen.</sentence><sentence id="179">I said to my mother, I said, "Why are you so swollen?"</sentence><sentence id="180">She was only 36 years old.</sentence><sentence id="181">She said, "Nothing, nothing, nothing."</sentence><sentence id="182">But

with her older sister.</sentence><sentence id="184">And they had nothing because they couldn't go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to bring in any food.</sentence><sentence id="185">So they had to live on whatever they gave them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">And the little kids died of hunger.</sentence><sentence id="187">There were little ones.</sentence><sentence id="188">And my grandma was dying, so she used to send me whatever she had to give it to grandma.</sentence><sentence id="189">Finally, she died a hunger.</sentence><sentence id="190">I came one day with the food, and I saw her laying against the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they lived in, dead.</sentence><sentence id="191">I don't know how long she was laying there.</sentence><sentence id="192">There was -- they didn't give any <span class="BUILDING">funerals</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="193">They just took her away, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="194">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="195">I really don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="196">This is how we lived for six months.</sentence><sentence id="197">At least six -- between six and eight months, I think it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
