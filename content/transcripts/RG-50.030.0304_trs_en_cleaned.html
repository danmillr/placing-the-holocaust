Well, I remember when Hitler came to power.</sentence><sentence id="65">They were, we were scared.</sentence><sentence id="66">This was the first time we realized that maybe a war.</sentence><sentence id="67">We knew all he wrote, I mean, and this was considered to be a threat.</sentence><sentence id="68">I do remember maybe in "38 or "37 some Jews who escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">I remember I, when I was on, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posznan</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> that I talked to a, to an elderly Jew who just escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and he was telling me all about it.</sentence><sentence id="70">Q. What was the general attitude in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posznan</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> towards the Nazis?</sentence><sentence id="71">A. Well, you know, to us Nazis were Germans and Germans were Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="72">And Germans were enemies.</sentence><sentence id="73">Germans were considered to be enemies.</sentence><sentence id="74">So at that time really we considered every German is a Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="75">You see it was over simplification, but this is how we... And after all, the support for Hitler was overwhelming in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, that we couldn't see any difference.</sentence><sentence id="76">We considered Germans as a big threat to us and that's from my young age, because Germans did want to take back the <span class="REGION">territories</span> which they lost to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after the war and they were always considered the greatest threat to us.</sentence><sentence id="77">But until the end of the war really we didn't differentiate much between the Germans and the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="78">Q. In this distrust of the Germans was really a very separate than the, their ideas about genocide.</sentence><sentence id="79">A. Well, you know genocide came late.</sentence><sentence id="80">Remember they were of course victims of Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I mean, the number of people that were executed was considerable.</sentence><sentence id="81">I lost my uncle who was executed in October "39, but this was not genocide.</sentence><sentence id="82">In the sense that came later.</sentence><sentence id="83">The genocide of Jews did come, happen in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="84">This is when it started.</sentence><sentence id="85">There was extermination of Poles and of Jews, but this was not a sort of a total extermination of race or religion of people who belonged to the race or to the religion.</sentence><sentence id="86">Many victims, there was a German terror.</sentence><sentence id="87">Q. Early on it was very clear that the Germans weren't, were going to try to eliminate Jewish people in one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="88">Your distrust of Germans and Nazis was more territorial?</sentence><sentence id="89">A. Well, as far as Jews are concerned during the war, no.</sentence><sentence id="90">Nobody really anticipated that there will be a sort of a total extermination of every Jew.</sentence><sentence id="91">That came later.</sentence><sentence id="92">We knew that Jews are persecuted, that they are discriminated, that they are being killed, but the final solution in the sense that every Jew had to be killed because the crime he committed was that he was alive, that came later.</sentence><sentence id="93">Q. l understand that.</sentence><sentence id="94">I was trying to distinguish between you as a catholic Pole disliking or distrusting or hating the Germans as something separate than because they were persecuting the Jews and other minorities.</sentence><sentence id="95">A. Well, they were persecuting Poles, they were, they were, of course, but it was all, we abhored it.</sentence><sentence id="96">This was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="97">But we in the first stages we considered the persecution of Jews as the part of Nazism, of atrocities that they were committing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="98">Of course I felt great sympathy for my Jewish friends.</sentence><sentence id="99">I remember, you know, when I came back from, when I escaped from captivity and we were living in the <span class="DLF">apartment block</span>, during the war people became very close to each other.</sentence><sentence id="100">We were no longer neighbors who didn't know what the other neighbor was doing.</sentence><sentence id="101">They were very close.</sentence><sentence id="102">And there was Antoni living in our block of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">A very nice man who was Jewish, and then they were all requested to leave the so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aryan district</span> and to move to,to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">And he was struggling with himself.</sentence><sentence id="105">Should he go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span> to move there or buy the, or get the legal papers and stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, which he felt was much more risky because this was a violation of law and every Jew that was caught <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="106">So, I, I remember how this man was fighting with each other, with, with himself.</sentence><sentence id="107">Should he and his family move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> or pretend he was, he was a Christian, and he finally decided to go there and probably that was his, his end eventually.</sentence><sentence id="108">Q.

Now, your family was able to stay together?</sentence><sentence id="231">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="232">Q. Was there semblance of normal life for you?</sentence><sentence id="233">A. The life was always normal even life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was normal.</sentence><sentence id="234">There were <span class="BUILDING">coffee houses</span>, there were <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span>, concerts everything in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> condemned to death.</sentence><sentence id="235">Life is always normal you know.</sentence><sentence id="236">People, children were playing.</sentence><sentence id="237">Also even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> so there was some normal life, family life.</sentence><sentence id="238">Everybody was trying to get his, eh, and for his life and all that.</sentence><sentence id="239">It was a normal life.</sentence><sentence id="240">Life in danger, life in terror, life in poverty, in shortages, but it was a normal life.</sentence><sentence id="241">More or less.</sentence><sentence id="242">Q. Generally, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> not so much when you chose to go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, was there any support for the German occupation?</sentence><sentence id="243">A. Very few.</sentence><sentence id="244">There were always, you know, in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> you have people who will cooperate and collaborate and denounce people, but frankly you know it was the Germans who united people.</sentence><sentence id="245">Since the, every <span class="NPIP">Pole</span> was, you know, also condemned.</sentence><sentence id="246">People because of this terror, they really became very, they got used to it, but they were united.</sentence><sentence id="247">There was a common anti-German front, no question.</sentence><sentence id="248">And we had no questling (?)</sentence><sentence id="249">government, for instance.</sentence><sentence id="250">And collaborators were shot.</sentence><sentence id="251">I mean, the people who collaborated with Germans were killed.</sentence><sentence id="252">By, they got sentences of death and they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="253">The underground was very ruthless with collaborators.</sentence><sentence id="254">It was a risky thing to collaborate with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="255">Q. Your government was --?</sentence><sentence id="256">A. There was, of course, administration was German.</sentence><sentence id="257">They were some <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for instance, <span class="BUILDING">city offices</span> Poles were employed.</sentence><sentence id="258">Germans had no manpower.</sentence><sentence id="259">They had used their manpower for war industry and, and in the front.</sentence><sentence id="260">So, they did use Poles but it was different thing to work in the, in the administration.</sentence><sentence id="261">It was not collaboration.</sentence><sentence id="262">It was not considered--as long as you were not used as an instrument to persecute others.</sentence><sentence id="263">So, of course they were, they were <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, <span class="BUILDING">labor offices</span> or municipal authorities.</sentence><sentence id="264">The same was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">The Jews were employed by the, by the German authorities in all kinds of organizations.</sentence><sentence id="266">Q. In your prewar government?</sentence><sentence id="267">A. Was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, but we did have an underground authority.</sentence><sentence id="268">It was a kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">underground state</span> which was kind of moral authority, you know.</sentence><sentence id="269">People did obey the orders that came from our underground government.</sentence><sentence id="270">Commander and chief of the Polish Home army of the military underground and there was so called delegation of the government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">And they did have considerable authority.</sentence><sentence id="272">Q. Which was respected by the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian community</span>?</sentence><sentence id="273">A. They were respected, yes.</sentence><sentence id="274">Q. And the underground worked in conjunction with the government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>?</sentence><sentence id="275">A. Well, there was daily communication by secret radios with the government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">There were couriers, emissaries.</sentence><sentence id="277">So, there was a contact and above all Polish radio from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and BBC.</sentence><sentence id="278">After all, everybody, it was daily bread, news from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, information from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, programs broadcast from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">It was a source of hope.</sentence><sentence id="280">Q. Can you tell me a little bit about the circumstances how you got involved with the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>?</sentence><sentence id="281">A. Well first I established some contact with some underground paper, but it was sort of a conservative paper which I didn't like very much, but there was no choice.</sentence><sentence id="282">I mean, I had no other contacts.</sentence><sentence id="283">But in "41 I did, I met somebody who really introduced me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and I joined so called Action Ann which was psychological warfare against the Nazis, against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="284">We produced German underground press, by, which was prepared by excellent experts.</sentence><sentence id="285">Mostly by Poles, who were bilingual, spoke as good German as Polish.</sentence><sentence id="286">And this was, we were pretending to be German newspapers which did create a sensation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">And it was never distributed from hands to hands because it would betray Polish souls.</sentence><sentence id="288">It was distributed by dropping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> or inside the book, inside the parcels that were sent to the soldiers in the front, in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span>, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">And my, my function was to organize distribution of this black propaganda press.</sentence><sentence id="290">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I didn't know German very well, very, just a few words, but there were so many Poles who became German, so-called volksdeutsch who didn't speak good German that it was not so bad as you may think.</sentence><sentence id="291">SO, I had to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> of so called Generalgouvernement, which was <span class="REGION">central Poland</span>, isolated from the rest of, of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, of <span class="REGION">occupied Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">And I had to find agents inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who were distributing this, this subversive literature.</sentence><sentence id="293">Which was a fascinating job.</sentence><sentence id="294">I traveled under disguise of Polish railway man and then German railway man which was the safest way to travel with forged documents of course.</sentence><sentence id="295">And that lasted until the spring of "43.</sentence><sentence id="296">In "43 I discovered the possibility to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> hidden in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">Swedes were importing iron ore to Germans and were taking coal from, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from <span class="REGION">Polish territories</span> and I was put in touch with some people from the underground who could place a blind passenger in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> of coal.</sentence><sentence id="298">So, I reported to my authorities and volunteered to go in this manner.</sentence><sentence id="299">And I became a courier.</sentence><sentence id="300">I was traveling with intelligence reports hidden in the microfilms and all kinds of objects.</sentence><sentence id="301">And after some adventures I did reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and that was just at the time of the uprising in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">And I learned about it by listening to the Polish radio in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> which was in touch with the secret radio in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">So, they were getting daily reports and I was very impressed by this and I remember I wrote a report about genocide of Jews to a Polish commander and chief and Prime Minister General Chicovsky (?),</sentence><sentence id="304">and were urging him that the allies must make some kind of threats of reprisals to Germans to stop it.</sentence><sentence id="305">And if they will not do anything, well Poles will be next.</sentence><sentence id="306">I used this, this argument, that if Germans will be completely, could, without any penalty, murder three million Jews then next after them will be Poles.</sentence><sentence id="307">And I know that report did reach the addressee and was passed over, passed on to Churchill.</sentence><sentence id="308">And I was told after the war that it did have some influence.</sentence><sentence id="309">I think the, this decision to bring war criminals before the <span class="BUILDING">international tribunal</span> was done more or less at that time.</sentence><sentence id="310">What I was really asking for was to have a kind of bombing which would be declared as a reprisal for mass murders of Jews, and I remember I used the argument you, you, the Americans and British are going to bomb the Germans anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="311">Why not to say this is an act of reprisal.</sentence><sentence id="312">No, nothing like that ever happened.</sentence><sentence id="313">So, I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and I was immediately commissioned to go this same route but to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">And at that time they put me in touch with a man in the underground who was in a contact man with the Jewish military organization in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, by the name of Henry Valinsky (2).</sentence><sentence id="315">And I was under instructions to get as much briefing about the Holocaust as it is called now.</sentence><sentence id="316">We didn't use this word at that time, about the Jewish uprising and to consider it a sort of a priority in my mission to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">And I did spend much time with Volinsky who told me all about the problems with even names of some militants, and I got microfilms and I was the man who brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> a report , a Jewish Militant Organization, written after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">I remember when I was boarding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">port Gdansk</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, the messenger came and gave me, I believe it was a battery or something, you know, battery for a torch and said, "You have to take it, this is a report, the story of the extermination of Jews and of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising."</sentence><sentence id="319">And it was -- I didn't know really exactly what it was until I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and the film was developed and it was a very impressive story written by the woman writer called Kahn, K-A-H-N. "P , Before the Eyes of the World," which was translated but I don't believe it was published, you know, because it was very little interesting the kind of atrocity stories at that time.</sentence><sentence id="320">So, this was my mission.</sentence><sentence id="321">I already knew that people in the west do not believe in the genocide on the scale that it took place.</sentence><sentence id="322">So, I approached a British NCO by the name of Ronnie Jeffrey who is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="323">He's in <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">He escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodje</span> (?).</sentence><sentence id="325">Q. You were talking about Mr. Jeffrey?</sentence><sentence id="326">A. Yes, so I didn't know that the credibility of a Pole with the British may be questionable so I approached a friend of mine, a British NCO by the name of Ronald Jeffrey, an extremely brave young man who escaped from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodje</span> (?).</sentence><sentence id="327">He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> in hiding and was very active in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">He was a man of considerable courage, spoke fluent German and learned Polish and I told him, "Ronnie, write the letter to London Times about the 0 Jews, about the atrocities and all that's going on and identify yourself.</sentence><sentence id="329">Give your number, your regiment and all that and I will ask that it's microfilmed and we'll send it to London Times."</sentence><sentence id="330">And it was developed, the microfilm was developed, and the Polish government sent it to London Times.</sentence><sentence id="331">They never published it.</sentence><sentence id="332">So when I met archbishop Temple who was the archbishop of Canterbury, head of the underground <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, he was really a good man and he was just not asking what can I do for you in the sense which implied, I can do nothing.</sentence><sentence id="333">He just asked the question.</sentence><sentence id="334">In the good sense, "Can I do something?,"</sentence><sentence id="335">and I said, "Well, you know, use your influence you are the second person after the king."</sentence><sentence id="336">Send my letter to the Times and ask why they didn't publish it.</sentence><sentence id="337">Use your influence to, with the Times to have this letter published.</sentence><sentence id="338">And I have his answer.</sentence><sentence id="339">I have his answer here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, the original letter.</sentence><sentence id="340">He says, "Mr.Nowak, I am sorry.</sentence><sentence id="341">Nothing to be done.</sentence><sentence id="342">London Times say they can not publish the letter because it could endanger the man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and the British POWs," which was nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="343">I mean he was one of I don't know how many thousand people living with the forged documents.</sentence><sentence id="344">Nobody could, how could the Germans find him?</sentence><sentence id="345">And I told about it Walter Laquer (?)</sentence><sentence id="346">when he was writing his books, and he approached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, London Times and said, "Do you have this letter in your archives?"</sentence><sentence id="347">They said, "No, the letter was destroyed," which is not true.</sentence><sentence id="348">I mean a letter smuggled from the <span class="REGION">occupied Poland</span> from a British prisoner of war was a curiosity.</sentence><sentence id="349">I'm sure they would keep it.</sentence><sentence id="350">They didn't want to admit they had this kind of letter and then publish it.</sentence><sentence id="351">Q. Now, I want to back track a little bit and learn more about the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, the Polish underground.</sentence><sentence id="352">What motivated you to get involved?</sentence><sentence id="353">A. Patriotic duty.</sentence><sentence id="354">I mean, I was a young man.</sentence><sentence id="355">I was the officer.</sentence><sentence id="356">I mean, it was my duty to fight on.</sentence><sentence id="357">That was the motivation of people who joined the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">Q. From where did all these people come?</sentence><sentence id="359">A. All walks of life, absolutely all walks of life.</sentence><sentence id="360">The <span class="REGION">countryside</span>--the peasants were extremely well-organized.</sentence><sentence id="361">For instance you know parachuting, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parachutes</span>, they got special committees by the peasants.</sentence><sentence id="362">They were peasant battalions, partisan units, guerrilla, intelligencia, they, they, everybody.</sentence><sentence id="363">If somebody was not in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> he was at least trying to help in some way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="364">But it was a conspiracy of the entire nation I would say.</sentence><sentence id="365">There were very few people who were not involved in this or other way.</sentence><sentence id="366">Which does not mean that organization itself probably would be no more than 100,000 but it had tremendous hinterland (?)</sentence><sentence id="367">of people supporting it, whether by offering <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> or helping in any way they could.</sentence><sentence id="368">So, that even if I didn't know a passerby I could approach him and say, "Look, help me."</sentence><sentence id="369">And it was a fantastic experience.</sentence><sentence id="370">I remember when German closed the <span class="DLF">street</span> because there was some attempt on the, attack on the SA unit, marching, this, hand grenade was thrown.</sentence><sentence id="371">I was inside the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> with some other people on the conspiracy.</sentence><sentence id="372">We were 1 told that everything is quiet.</sentence><sentence id="373">We can leave.</sentence><sentence id="374">I was the first one who left and when I was leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the gestapo man stopped me and he said, "Where did you come from?"</sentence><sentence id="375">I knew if I say which <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> the rest of my colleagues including my finance were there.</sentence><sentence id="376">So over his shoulder I saw the name of a dentist and I said I left the <span class="INT_SPACE">dentist's room</span> and I gave her name.</sentence><sentence id="377">He took me to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, picked up the phone and called the dentist with my identity card and said, "Was a man by this name in your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="378">I thought that's the end.</sentence><sentence id="379">He put down the received you can go.</sentence><sentence id="380">She said yes of course he was.</sentence><sentence id="381">He, I never saw the lady.</sentence><sentence id="382">She never saw me, but she was in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">She knew what this was all about.</sentence><sentence id="384">So, yes, of course he was in, he was my patient.</sentence><sentence id="385">He was in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">This was the kind of conspiracy where everybody was trying to help and assist.</sentence><sentence id="387">I lost ticket, a ticket when I was with my compromising material.</sentence><sentence id="388">I approached a worker who had a season railway ticket and I asked him could you please buy me a ticket because I cannot go through the schpera (?)</sentence><sentence id="389">without the ticket.</sentence><sentence id="390">Of course he didn't know who I was.</sentence><sentence id="391">He went, bought the ticket and brought me the ticket.</sentence><sentence id="392">I left the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> safely.</sentence><sentence id="393">So everywhere there was some kind assistance.</sentence><sentence id="394">That's why we would act.</sentence><sentence id="395">Q. Did the organization of the underground evolve out of prewar political organizations?</sentence><sentence id="396">A. It evolved spontaneously.</sentence><sentence id="397">They were really secret organizations which were mushrooming after the defeat of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="398">At the same time the commanding officers were appointed by our authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and they were trying to unite this whole kind of spontaneous organization into one underground force and they managed to do so.</sentence><sentence id="399">But the initiative would come from grass roots.</sentence><sentence id="400">Q. Were there any Jews in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>?</sentence><sentence id="401">A. Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="402">I mean, for instance my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> mate, a little older Lucian 2 was in, in the, in my, very close to me in the organization.</sentence><sentence id="403">Jusak (?)</sentence><sentence id="404">Handelsman, he's, he's, professor Handelsman, who was killed by the Germans later.</sentence><sentence id="405">I could name several other people.</sentence><sentence id="406">Yes, there were some Jews in the underground movement.</sentence><sentence id="407">Q. Not a lot?</sentence><sentence id="408">A. Not many because, because you know there was, this was a terrific danger.</sentence><sentence id="409">You know, the man Lucian ?</sentence><sentence id="410">for instance, was, had very Jewish features.</sentence><sentence id="411">Now if he would be caught with some compromising material and tortured, he would betray others, so it was dangerous to have a Jew who could be recognized as a Jew in the organization.</sentence><sentence id="412">But, there were some.</sentence><sentence id="413">Q. Was there any coordination between the Polish underground and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> underground?</sentence><sentence id="414">A. Yes, but not from the very beginning because at the beginning Jews like Dr. Jenokov (?),</sentence><sentence id="415">for instance, they took the position that if we resist, I mean if Jews we resist, all will be killed.</sentence><sentence id="416">If 2 we don't resist, if we simply carry out orders, some will be killed and some will survive.</sentence><sentence id="417">This was a wrong philosophy.</sentence><sentence id="418">And the first really Jewish militant units were formed only after this big wave of extermination at the end of "42.</sentence><sentence id="419">And then they were trying to establish contact with us and to get weapons.</sentence><sentence id="420">Now, initially the Polish military were reluctant because they were not sure if they will fight but later they have shown tremendous determination and they did get weapons.</sentence><sentence id="421">Not enough, not sufficient.</sentence><sentence id="422">They were always complaining they don't get enough.</sentence><sentence id="423">But also not only weapons because we were very short of weapons until British started really to throw a lot of weapons since April "44.</sentence><sentence id="424">But we were for instance, I know that the Poles were giving them contacts to the, where they could buy weapons from Germans.</sentence><sentence id="425">It was a possibility.</sentence><sentence id="426">There were many German soldiers who were selling their weapons.</sentence><sentence id="427">So whatever they had they got from us, but this was very poor equipment.</sentence><sentence id="428">They were poorly equipped.</sentence><sentence id="429">Some pistols, some few guns.</sentence><sentence id="430">It was very small, very poorly equipped insurgence army.</sentence><sentence id="431">Q. Was there any coordination in terms of information?</sentence><sentence id="432">A. There were, there were liaison people who were coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, mostly by <span class="DLF">sewers</span> or other ways.</sentence><sentence id="433">I don't know what.</sentence><sentence id="434">One of them was Antec Zuckerman (?),</sentence><sentence id="435">for instance.</sentence><sentence id="436">He was the one that was kind of a liaison between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="437">There were some others.</sentence><sentence id="438">And there was an organized transport of arms.</sentence><sentence id="439">The men who were really in touch with them was was among others.</sentence><sentence id="440">He was the one who was assigned to be a kind of a liaison with Jews.</sentence><sentence id="441">Q. What were the primary goals of the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>?</sentence><sentence id="442">A. Fight for independence, for freedom.</sentence><sentence id="443">Fight with the enemy, fight with the Germans for freedom.</sentence><sentence id="444">That was the goal, as in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as in every <span class="REGION">occupied country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="445">Q. Did the ways in which you hoped to achieve that change or evolve as the war went on.</sentence><sentence id="446">A. I didn't get your question.</sentence><sentence id="447">Q. When you say fight with the enemy obviously you worked in a more political or propagandist end for quite a while.</sentence><sentence id="448">A. It was also kind of a struggle, a very important one, psychological warfare.</sentence><sentence id="449">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="450">Q. I'm just wondering if the ways in which you wanted to achieve this freedom or independence evolved or if you always had kind of a full scale strategy in place of how to do this both militarily and politically.</sentence><sentence id="451">A. Well, of course it developed gradually, but the concept was clear.</sentence><sentence id="452">It was all out fight on every <span class="NPIP">sector</span>.</sentence><sentence id="453">Psychological warfare was only one of many but there was urban guerrilla.</sentence><sentence id="454">There were partisan units in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">There was sabotage of all kind.</sentence><sentence id="456">It was all out fight with many directions.</sentence><sentence id="457">There were the units that were trying to terrorize the Germans, who were executing Germans.</sentence><sentence id="458">It was a very broad front to inflict as much on them as possible.</sentence><sentence id="459">And to contribute to the victory.</sentence><sentence id="460">Q. How much information did you have about other operations working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>?</sentence><sentence id="461">3 A. Not much, whatever, only what was published in the underground papers, because the tule was that if you belong to one <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, or one unit, you are not allowed to get, involve yourself in any other.</sentence><sentence id="462">This was the rule to protect organization.</sentence><sentence id="463">You, you shouldn't try to know more than you have to know because if you are arrested you never know how you will, you know, will you, if you will not under tortures, if you will not break down and will not betray others.</sentence><sentence id="464">It was assumed that the man who is arrested and tortured may tell the Germans under, you know, tortures, things about others.</sentence><sentence id="465">So the policy was that everybody had to limit, to have his knowledge as limited as possible.</sentence><sentence id="466">4 Tape 2 Q. How extensive was the Polish underground?</sentence><sentence id="467">A. It was very extensive because in addition to people who were organized, and I believe people who were organized were probably no more than 400,000.</sentence><sentence id="468">There was a hinterland, the people who were supporting by offering <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> or any kind of help so that frankly we could operate mainly because of this kind of spontaneous assistance from people who were not themselves organized but who were ready to accept the risks and to help.</sentence><sentence id="469">Q. Had this whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">state</span> essentially gone underground?</sentence><sentence id="470">I mean, what kind of services were-- A. Well, it was really an underground state.</sentence><sentence id="471">There were <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, underground <span class="BUILDING">courts</span>, underground <span class="BUILDING">justice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="472">There was, there were underground <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="473">There was a whole underground life really, and it comprised the entire society really.</sentence><sentence id="474">So Jan Karski (?)</sentence><sentence id="475">called his book published in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> during the war "The Story of the Underground State," and it was the underground state.</sentence><sentence id="476">Q. Who was getting prosecuted in these <span class="BUILDING">courts</span>?</sentence><sentence id="477">A. Oh, the traitors, collaborators with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="478">This was the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to sentence the people who were guilty of collaboration with the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="479">Also the people who, for instance, denouncing Jews were, were also put before this <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and executed.</sentence><sentence id="480">But, Gestapo people, particularly cruel Germans and it was also a kind of psychological warfare because the man who was sentenced would first get the sentence and then he would be killed or he would get a warning that he's going to be put before this kind of <span class="BUILDING">underground court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="481">But this was a regular <span class="BUILDING">court</span> with the attorneys.</sentence><sentence id="482">They were mostly professional judges or professional lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="483">So, there were regular <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> and they were using the Polish penal code.</sentence><sentence id="484">Q. In all these spontaneous organizations and prewar political organizations they all came together and supported this unified system?</sentence><sentence id="485">A. Correct.</sentence><sentence id="486">There were some groups that did not belong to it.</sentence><sentence id="487">Extreme right wing groups were, did not belong to the, this underground state and communists.</sentence><sentence id="488">Otherwise there were people of all possible outlooks.</sentence><sentence id="489">There were nationalists, there were social democrats, there were catholics, all kinds of groups--peasants.</sentence><sentence id="490">The whole spector of political views with the exception of extreme rightist and communists.</sentence><sentence id="491">Q. Were they a problem?</sentence><sentence id="492">A. They were a problem, particularly communists but also the extreme right wing were problems.</sentence><sentence id="493">Q. How did you get your supplies and what supplies were especially important to you?</sentence><sentence id="494">A. What?</sentence><sentence id="495">Q. How did you get the supplies the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> needed?</sentence><sentence id="496">5 A. Well you know, the money and the weapons did come from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">They were parachuted.</sentence><sentence id="498">There were some weapons that were bought from Germans or we simply attacked the German units and took the weapons.</sentence><sentence id="499">But supply of money would come mainly from first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">From <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">Q. What other supplies were really crucial to your efforts?</sentence><sentence id="502">A. Mostly weapons, but money as well because people had to live from something.</sentence><sentence id="503">If somebody could, lost his legal life, so to speak, he had to live with false documents, he couldn't work, so he had to be put on the payroll.</sentence><sentence id="504">So, money was extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="505">The underground press had to buy papers.</sentence><sentence id="506">Q. So if you had the money you could get any of the other <span class="NPIP">things</span> you needed?</sentence><sentence id="507">A. Yes, including even weapons but one could buy weapons from some German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="508">Weapons and ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="509">Q. What sort of risk did you, did you personally have to take a lot of high risk?</sentence><sentence id="510">A. Oh, yes, I had to risk my life very often.</sentence><sentence id="511">I mean any crossing of the <span class="DLF">border</span> with forged documents and with compromising material was very risky.</sentence><sentence id="512">Moving around in the, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, being a Pole, was very risky even considering that I didn't speak good German.</sentence><sentence id="513">Crossing from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> was not an easy matter.</sentence><sentence id="514">I don't want to advertise myself because people were taking considerable risks.</sentence><sentence id="515">Many people died.</sentence><sentence id="516">Many people were arrested and died.</sentence><sentence id="517">I was very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="518">Q. How afraid were you at the time?</sentence><sentence id="519">A. I was, I really had probably no imagination.</sentence><sentence id="520">Because as I told you before I was once scared to death when a Jewish girl with very characteristic Jewish features asked me that I, that she should take me under arm to cross the so called schpera (?),</sentence><sentence id="521">you know, where Germans were checking.</sentence><sentence id="522">I knew that if they would arrest her I would be executed as well, so I was afraid.</sentence><sentence id="523">I was very much afraid before the parachute training.</sentence><sentence id="524">It was a kind of suicide really to jump out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">It was a, but otherwise I got used to it.</sentence><sentence id="526">I never thought about dangers and risks and I was not very much afraid simply because I was not thinking about what may happen.</sentence><sentence id="527">This was the best thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="528">Q. How much initiative did you have to take versus systems that were in place for you?</sentence><sentence id="529">A. Every day, every step.</sentence><sentence id="530">It all depended on my initiative, on my concepts, my ideas, how to act, what to do, how to avoid dangers, how to find the people who can help.</sentence><sentence id="531">You were left to your own resources mostly.</sentence><sentence id="532">Q. What prepared you for this?</sentence><sentence id="533">A. What?</sentence><sentence id="534">Q. What do you think prepared you for this kind of activity?</sentence><sentence id="535">A. I had the motivation I think.</sentence><sentence id="536">I did want to serve my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and to help to, to defeat the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="537">Q. Tell me a little bit more about the propaganda campaign, its action end.</sentence><sentence id="538">A. Well it was a psychological warfare with the main purpose was to demoralize the Germans by all kinds of tricks.</sentence><sentence id="539">For instance, instruction, "How to behave to avoid, you know, 6 frost at the <span class="REGION">east front</span>," which was so terrible, the instructions, that would frighten anybody going to the <span class="REGION">east front</span>, to the, to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">That's just one example.</sentence><sentence id="541">For instance, the Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, yes, would get a secret instructions that the gas attack, chemical weapon attack by Russians is expected in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and that they should go to the such and such <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to collect gas masks.</sentence><sentence id="542">You see?</sentence><sentence id="543">But they are not allowed to tell Poles about it because there are not enough gas masks.</sentence><sentence id="544">We knew there were no gas masks at all.</sentence><sentence id="545">So, the Germans would make <span class="DLF">queues</span>, would come for gas masks and were told we don't have any gas masks for you which would spread panic of course.</sentence><sentence id="546">There were for instance we would send the secret instructions--no, not secret, open instructions that there is such and such anniversary in the Nazi movement and today is free from work.</sentence><sentence id="547">It was not, but if every worker and every engineer in a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> producing weapons they would not come to work and it would be a terrific waste of manpower, you see.</sentence><sentence id="548">We were forging secret forms of all kind of Nazi documents and, you know, all kinds of managers, directors, important people would get an order.</sentence><sentence id="549">For instance the important engineer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> would get an order to go the party meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="550">So, he would put his SA uniform on him and he would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to say that you are a victim of a joke.</sentence><sentence id="551">Okay but he would not be at <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="552">It would inflict considerable damage to war machinery.</sentence><sentence id="553">So, it was a kind of a psychological sabotage which was extremely effective.</sentence><sentence id="554">And above all, to give the Germans the impression that there is an anti-Nazi resistance movement which in fact did not exist.</sentence><sentence id="555">That there is anti-Hitler plots.</sentence><sentence id="556">All this had certain psychological impact on Germans and I think we were pretty effective in this.</sentence><sentence id="557">Q. Were you thinking up a lot of these schemes?</sentence><sentence id="558">A. No.</sentence><sentence id="559">My job really was to organize the network and distribution and the others were thinking about, you know, were finding the ideas how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="560">Q. Did you have any sense of how effective it was?</sentence><sentence id="561">A. We did, because we did have all kinds of secret German documents how to fight it, how to -- and Germans went out of their way to find us, to arrest us and so on.</sentence><sentence id="562">And then we had the report from the British Intelligence Service which found that this was a very effective job.</sentence><sentence id="563">We got a lot of praise from the British for this kind of propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="564">They did have their own black propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="565">We were trying -- one of my jobs was to establish cooperation between British black propaganda which was mostly, mostly for, by radio, you know.</sentence><sentence id="566">But radio which were posing as the German underground radios and the man who was conducting it was a genius by the name of Sefton Delmer (?).</sentence><sentence id="567">I met him and he praised our effort very highly.</sentence><sentence id="568">He respected what we were doing.</sentence><sentence id="569">Q. What was your biggest challenge in setting up this <span class="BUILDING">distribution network</span>?</sentence><sentence id="570">A. Well, to travel, travel with the forged documents with the compromising material under, with the uniform of a railway man without good knowledge of German.</sentence><sentence id="571">There was a considerable risk in it but it was fun.</sentence><sentence id="572">It was, I considered it the most fascinating part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="573">Q. Was it easy to recruit people for this?</sentence><sentence id="574">7 A. It was easy.</sentence><sentence id="575">Too many people.</sentence><sentence id="576">There were too many volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="577">You had to be selective, but people did want to work for us and were really contemptuous of the, of the risk of life.</sentence><sentence id="578">Q. Now when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, you were there doing what?</sentence><sentence id="579">A. Well, I arrived right after the on 11th of December "43 and I left on I believe the 14th of July, or maybe, no maybe on 11th of July "44.</sentence><sentence id="580">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richt</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on the 25th of July, just before the Warsaw uprising and I was sent after the collapse of the uprising back and we reached, it was a long journey.</sentence><sentence id="581">We reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> on 22nd of January "45.</sentence><sentence id="582">This was the last trip.</sentence><sentence id="583">Q. On your first trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, why were you sent there.</sentence><sentence id="584">What was your role?</sentence><sentence id="585">A. Emissary, a man who were bringing some very important messages, oral, briefing.</sentence><sentence id="586">I had a mission.</sentence><sentence id="587">And also of course I had my microfilms with me.</sentence><sentence id="588">But, but it was, they were important reports from the commander in chief in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to the Polish commander and chief in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and to the Polish government.</sentence><sentence id="589">My main mission was to brief and to tell people.</sentence><sentence id="590">I mean, I met Anthony Eden.</sentence><sentence id="591">I met at least five other members of the war cabinet.</sentence><sentence id="592">It was Annis Bevin (2), Archibold Singer (?)</sentence><sentence id="593">who was the minister of the airforce.</sentence><sentence id="594">Lord Selbourne, psychological warfare, Morrison (?).</sentence><sentence id="595">Annis Bevin was labor and at the end I met Churchill.</sentence><sentence id="596">This was my last meeting.</sentence><sentence id="597">I met many parliamentarians, many journalists.</sentence><sentence id="598">Q. What kind of information were you taking?</sentence><sentence id="599">A. About the underground activities, about the situation there.</sentence><sentence id="600">About our plans of action, and above all we were trying to really get support in view of the coming danger from the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="601">I mean it was not only the fight against the Germans, we were then already facing great danger of the Russians, of the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="602">My mission was really to convince the British and the Americans that they should in some way help us resist Soviet designs to subjugate <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the rest of the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">This was one of my most important missions.</sentence><sentence id="604">One of my missions was also to report about genocide of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="605">This was a high priority mission.</sentence><sentence id="606">I got instructions, to consider it a very high priority.</sentence><sentence id="607">Q. When you met with Mr. Eden and some of these other ministers, did you, what kind of response did you get from them?</sentence><sentence id="608">A. Well, it was friendly.</sentence><sentence id="609">There was interest because it was an unusual thing to have an emissary from <span class="REGION">occupied country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="610">And at the same time the attitude, "Well, what can we do for you?</sentence><sentence id="611">Do you want us to make a war with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to defend <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>?</sentence><sentence id="612">What can we, how can we help you?"</sentence><sentence id="613">I was right in the middle of the game between, between Joseph Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the middle and I was trying to use this influence.</sentence><sentence id="614">I also was telling everybody I could about the genocide, about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="615">I met with disbelief with, when I talked to the Jews from joint organization with some rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="616">8 I was in the presence of Ignace Schwartzbart (?)</sentence><sentence id="617">who was a Polish zionist an important political figure.</sentence><sentence id="618">I sensed that they don't believe me and only one high level British intellengence officer was really moved by my story about the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="619">And he told me, in the same, I was told the same story by Ignace Schwartzbart (?).</sentence><sentence id="620">Don't tell people that two and half million Jews were killed.</sentence><sentence id="621">Nobody is going to believe you.</sentence><sentence id="622">It's something beyond imagination.</sentence><sentence id="623">They will say you exaggerate.</sentence><sentence id="624">Tell individual stories.</sentence><sentence id="625">Tell what you saw.</sentence><sentence id="626">Use examples but don't use statistics because you will, they will not believe you.</sentence><sentence id="627">And I was trying to use it, but when I and my wife, after the war in "76, when I was writing my war memoirs, we both went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, to the archives, to Her Majesty's records office.</sentence><sentence id="628">Plenty of documents were already declassified and I found a lot of documents concerning myself.</sentence><sentence id="629">The report that Antony Eden wrote after meeting me addressed to Churchill.</sentence><sentence id="630">In all this reports, nothing about what I said about the Jews, at not one word I spoke to the intelligence officers.</sentence><sentence id="631">I spoke to the, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eden</span>, to others.</sentence><sentence id="632">In all their reporting any reference to the Jews were not repeated.</sentence><sentence id="633">Then I was interested to find if the same story was with Jan Karski (?),</sentence><sentence id="634">who was one year before me.</sentence><sentence id="635">And I found a report of Antony Eden on his conversation with Karski in the documents of the British war cabinet.</sentence><sentence id="636">It was printed and distributed.</sentence><sentence id="637">Not one word about the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="638">So, I sent it to Karski and he wrote me back, saying, "Look, I mean, I told Eden, when I was describing the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I told about what's going on with the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="639">Not one word.</sentence><sentence id="640">Not one word, and the main reason I think, you know, you had to differentiate between two categories of people.</sentence><sentence id="641">There are people who simply didn't believe because this was something beyond their imagination.</sentence><sentence id="642">And there were Jews, Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I talked to and British Jews who simply didn't believe.</sentence><sentence id="643">They didn't believe that there is a possibility of mass killing in a sort of conveyor belt method, you know, like in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, or in a butchery.</sentence><sentence id="644">You just mechanically kill people one after the other.</sentence><sentence id="645">They didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="646">And they, they were suspecting me of some kind of ulterior motive.</sentence><sentence id="647">They said, "Why a Pole should exaggerate?Well, because he's anti-German and he would like to have as harsh terms imposed on the Germans after that defeat as possible.</sentence><sentence id="648">That's why he's exaggerating."</sentence><sentence id="649">And they were, but, as far as such people as Eden is concerned or members of the cabinet, they were very well informed because after, discovered it after the war, that for instance, a very high level Nazi official, whose name is known, was passing to a Polish intelligence officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, information about the plans of final solution well before it was they started to implement it.</sentence><sentence id="650">And I know that this report was passed on to British and to Americans.</sentence><sentence id="651">They knew but they didn't -- they were afraid that if this would become known publicly it would generate the pressure from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> and general public for some kind of action that would divert limited military resources from the military targets to the targets that are in their view irrelevant from the military point of view, and that may prolong the war.</sentence><sentence id="652">I don't remember if it was <span class="NPIP">Eden</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="653"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bevine</span> (?),</sentence><sentence id="654">rather, Annis Bevine who said, "Well the only way we can really save the Jews is to win the war.</sentence><sentence id="655">And the more we can focus on military targets, strategic military, the better to the Jews."</sentence><sentence id="656">I think they refused to bomb the <span class="DLF">railway track</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because they believed that they would be repaired in a matter of days or hours, but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> 9 may be lost.</sentence><sentence id="657">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> which could be used to bomb the important target in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be diverted from the target.</sentence><sentence id="658">And they were wrong because the greatest tragedy of Jews was not just their deaths.</sentence><sentence id="659">Indifference of the world.</sentence><sentence id="660">That absolut--They were absolutely lonely in the face of their death.</sentence><sentence id="661">It was in the, they realized the world doesn't care about them.</sentence><sentence id="662">That's what killed them, about the dimension of the crime, we are lonely, you see, and this was, in my view, it was a crime, really, not to do something.</sentence><sentence id="663">The kind of a moral relief that we tried to do something to save you, you know.</sentence><sentence id="664">Q. What was your impression of Eden and Churchill?</sentence><sentence id="665">A. Well, Churchill was not very friendly.</sentence><sentence id="666">It was, really, I had only ten minutes and I was so intimidated by his appearance and some kind of, you know, impression. "</sentence><sentence id="667">Well why really this young man is taking my time?"</sentence><sentence id="668">This kind of thing, that I lost my self, I was not good, my performance was not good because I was so nervous that I didn't perform well with Churchill.</sentence><sentence id="669">But with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eden</span> I was pretty lucid and, as I say, he was very, very friendly.</sentence><sentence id="670">When I showed him the photographs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> with the, some underground inscriptions of the war on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and all that, he said to himself, "Poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>," and all that, but there was the attitude well, we cannot do anything for you.</sentence><sentence id="671">I mean, you have to accommodate yourself with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="672">You know, we cannot save you.</sentence><sentence id="673">We cannot save <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="674">You have to make your war effort to contribute and to try to find some kind of compromise with Stalin.</sentence><sentence id="675">That was the message basically.</sentence><sentence id="676">Q. Discouraging?</sentence><sentence id="677">A. Discouraging!</sentence><sentence id="678">It was the worst time of my entire life.</sentence><sentence id="679">Appeasement, total appeasement.</sentence><sentence id="680">Q. When you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, was right before the uprising, the Polish uprising, what were you doing during the uprising?</sentence><sentence id="681">A. I was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">insurgent radio station</span> called , Lightening, which was broadcasting literally from the <span class="DLF">front line</span> because we were trying to be as close to the Germans as possible because then they couldn't bomb us from fear they would hid their own soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="682">And we were broadcasting.</sentence><sentence id="683">I was in charge of broadcasting in English.</sentence><sentence id="684">My own English was not good enough at that time and I had a man who was bilingual.</sentence><sentence id="685">He was half British, half Polish.</sentence><sentence id="686">I wrote.</sentence><sentence id="687">He would translate it and he was the announcer.</sentence><sentence id="688">And we knew we were monitored by extremely sophisticated equipment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cavicham</span> (?)</sentence><sentence id="689">in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and monitoring bulletins would land on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> of all high level people, decision making people, <span class="BUILDING">editorial offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="690">So it was an effort worthwhile.</sentence><sentence id="691">Even now the old quote that we're saying, would get through in German or that, is still there on the record.</sentence><sentence id="692">Q. During the uprising, did the home army have the support of or instructions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>?</sentence><sentence id="693">0 A. No, we had, we had some parachute, you know, some weapons and ammunition and food parachuted.</sentence><sentence id="694">It was not enough but even without this kind of help the uprising would not last 63 days.</sentence><sentence id="695">Then we had one at the very end when the uprising was in it's agony on the 18th of September there was a mass daylight raid by American so called fortresses so that the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was covered by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> and they dropped thousands of parachutes with weapons, ammunition and food.</sentence><sentence id="696">But this were the last days of the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="697">We were holding the very small parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so most of it went into the Germans hands because they couldn't hit the small <span class="REGION">areas</span> we were still holding.</sentence><sentence id="698">Q. Was there Russian support during the uprising?</sentence><sentence id="699">A. Only appearances of it.</sentence><sentence id="700">No, they wanted us.</sentence><sentence id="701">They wanted Germans to finish us.</sentence><sentence id="702">They, I could see them with my eyes, I mean, on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> separated by, you know, the, divided by the <span class="RIVER">River Vistula</span>.</sentence><sentence id="703">They were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> waiting until Hitler finished us.</sentence><sentence id="704">Q. Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> supportive of what you were doing at this point?</sentence><sentence id="705">A. Who?</sentence><sentence id="706">Q. Your London government?</sentence><sentence id="707">A. Of course, I mean, they, they were supporting, but they were helpless, I mean it was a government in exile.</sentence><sentence id="708">All they could do was to beg British to, and Americans, to give us, send us ammunition, weapons, food, medical supplies.</sentence><sentence id="709">Q. How organized was the uprising?</sentence><sentence id="710">A. It was well organized.</sentence><sentence id="711">It was, otherwise we would not hold for 63 days.</sentence><sentence id="712">Again, it was a kind of, of liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, really, with its own life but communication was very well organized.</sentence><sentence id="713">They were, for instance, we were using <span class="DLF">sewers</span> because the areas of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were isolated and communication between the <span class="REGION">areas</span> we were holding were mostly through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">Q. What kind of messages were you sending to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>?</sentence><sentence id="715">A. Well, information about the fighting, about our needs.</sentence><sentence id="716">This was our daily reports of what's, what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="717">Q. Were you in your <span class="BUILDING">radio tower</span> when the under, under whatever it is, started?</sentence><sentence id="718">A. No, the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> was, was on the very, either in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> or on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="719">We moved from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="720">We couldn't be in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="721">The normal transmitter was <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">Q. But you weren't really in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> when all of this activity--- A. Well, we had to move through the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">Q.
