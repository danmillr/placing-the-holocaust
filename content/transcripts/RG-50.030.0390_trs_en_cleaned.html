<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1826">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1828">Q: -- in your head, that hey --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: Well, I'll tell you, because I didn't -- I want to say that in 19 -- when they established the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in 1941, in -- in October -- now, in beginning 1942, they broke into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna ghetto</span> from surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ginefcare</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Narefkar</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielovairsh</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karminitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1831">Four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, those were little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And what 3 happened, fortunately, you know, most of the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, you know, in 1941 or in 19, beginning "42, they liquidated them, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1833">They didn't bother even establishing a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1834">They liquidate them -- they -- they killed them on the spot or they took them out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> -- took them out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and killed.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And then, after -- after that, it was of course -- it -- it was too much of a -- they didn't have the power yet, the -- the -- the manpower, it was a tall job.</sentence><sentence id="1836">And -- so they start bringing in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna ghettos</span>, of s- some -- those that are fortunate and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> swelled from about -- we had -- like is mentioned, 6000 Jews, 1000 from here, 2000 from here, so finally the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> swelled to 12,000.</sentence><sentence id="1837">And some -- some were brought in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ginefcare</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1838">And some were marched by foot for 80 -- you know, from -- especially from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Narefkar</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we had to take in a family from there and they marched them.</sentence><sentence id="1839">They marched them, you know, the whole -- from, it's about, I would say maybe 16 -17 kilometers, can you imagine?</sentence><sentence id="1840">So half -- what happened to the cripples, from the children and the -- and the what you call it?</sentence><sentence id="1841">A lot of them you know, lost -- lost parents, air children.</sentence><sentence id="1842">They couldn't ma -- you know and those who couldn't make it, they shot them on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="1843">And eventually those who made it, brought them in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1844">So we heard -- we heard from those people, we right there you know, we had to take in.</sentence><sentence id="1845">You had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we take in some families, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1846">Some says, you know, and they've lost a father or lost a -- lost a little baby or lost a child, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1847">And then they brought in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, it's a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, so they brought in 2000 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna</span>, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1848">Now, I want to mention that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna</span> and the vicinity was enclosed in the Third Reich, they call it, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1849">They incorporated -- fer-favored the Third Reich, we going to be treated a little better.</sentence><sentence id="1850">Wa -- the reason they incorporated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna</span> in the Third Reich, is because we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielovairsh</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielovairsh</span> a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, were the famous <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1851">One of the biggest famous <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, that's about 60 or 70 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And there were famous for certain animals.</sentence><sentence id="1853">And -- and Goering and all the groups and -- and -- and -- and Himmler, they used to hunt there.</sentence><sentence id="1854">That's the reason -- that's the reason they incorporated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna</span> and even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span>, the certain <span class="REGION">territory</span> and they call it to the east, <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1855">Not to -- you know, greater <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1856">So comparison with other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, maybe we were treated a little bit in the beginning, better, because we didn't have those -- th-they call it aktiones -- actions.</sentence><sentence id="1857">The German cou -- you know, aktiones, like in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, they requested, let's see, right away, 1000 inslawnie 2000 - 5000 action and they -- they took them out someplace in -- in certain, you know, ravines and certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> right away and -- even 19 -- in -- in the beginning of the war, and they killed.</sentence><sentence id="1858">So we didn't have that, we didn't have the actions, you know, like [indecipherable] hundred and except -- except it was -- you know, every once in awhile, every day there was some casualties, you know we had -- you know, the -- when outsider -- some -- they took people off the stru -- 60 years old.</sentence><sentence id="1859">So it means some -- some were mistreated and some couldn't make it, some were weak, so there was some casualties.</sentence><sentence id="1860">We had to bring them in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1861">So we were told, you know, there is two or three, every once in awhile I heard that they brought them in -- in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and -- for burial.</sentence><sentence id="1862">Now -- now that -- my -- what I want to mention is this, I had an uncle the one -- the one was -- yes, you know, associated in the -- for the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1863">Now, we had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1864">We weren't getting bread, we were getting flour.</sentence><sentence id="1865">And 4 we were the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in the -- in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the fire -- the fire engine, you know, the f -- the -- it was -- it's -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we suppose we were in a fire, you know, the -- the -- we had to take care -- the <span class="BUILDING">fire station</span> was in -- the same -- already was -- it was stationed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna ghetto</span> and with a -- with a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proushinna ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1866">So, yeah, we had to speak in my -- my uncle, so he f -- like -- was a farmer and we had some -- a fleet of horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> to -- any time the German requested, for instance, if you have to take down 50 people to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> or 100 people to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1867">So they told us, they were -- they were the truckers, we didn't have no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, they were -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had taken the people down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and see, my uncle was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1868">They -- they -- what do you call it?The experiments with dogs, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1869">He was torn by dogs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1911">Q: Can you explain a little more?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1913">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hm</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1915">Q: Can you just explain a little more?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1917">A: Well, the experiments with dogs are -- one dog -- how long is going to take -- how long is going to take dogs to kill a person.</sentence><sentence id="1918">You understand?</sentence><sentence id="1919">Ah.</sentence><sentence id="1920">You know, th-th-they experiment, they wanted -- they wanted to know how long is going to take one dog or two dogs, finally, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1921">So, that's -- that's a -- that -- that happened.</sentence><sentence id="1922">That made a big impression on me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1929">Q: When did you -- can you tell us a little bit more about when you began to think and talk with your friends about your --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1931">A: Well, this happened in 1942, this and then -- see, we had so many brought in in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, escapees.</sentence><sentence id="1932">Like I mention, they brought some in from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1933">And then they used to pick some -- find some Jews from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> -- for instance, and somebody survived and they used to drop him in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1934">So, you know, we heard all this -- all kind of stories, so I was wondering, you know, they could have killed them, now why did they brought them in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1935">Some work -- he was telling us that he survived somehow, I know some way and from the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he was wandering and they caught him and they put -- the Germans caught him and drop him in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1936">So, it -- it mean -- it, you know, it reached your mind that understanding there is -- there is something -- you know, it's a matter of time.</sentence><sentence id="1937">Now, why did they have to bring in -- I was o figure, why did they have to bring in those escapees, those -- those survivors?</sentence><sentence id="1938">They could have killed them, they dropped them in the -- you know, many -- they dropped him in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1939">We hear -- we heard all kind of atrocities with -- you know, leaving a trai -- you know, leaving witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="1940">So we understood that's -- you know, there's a matter of time, you know, it's a matter of time.</sentence><sentence id="1941">And -- and fortunately, when -- you know, in -- the -- when the group was established, many -- there's a lot of -- from the group, worked in different kind of <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1942">One from our group worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, sent to cut fo -- for -- you know, for a week and he was work and they left -- you know, they stayed there in the 5 <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for a week and at night Russian couple -- couple -- Russian partisans came over.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And the Germans slept already there.</sentence><sentence id="1944">They came over and they says, "Well, if you going to get some arms, we'll take you in."</sentence><sentence id="1945">They were -- it wasn't organized yet.</sentence><sentence id="1946">You know, it was -- it was independent groups, I call it, you know it -- it was still -- you've -- you've -- you could find in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> that time, criminals.</sentence><sentence id="1947">You can find escapees from -- pr- prisoners, Russian prisoners, [indecipherable] you know, they went in in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1948">They had the ammunition instead of getting, you n -- take a big -- taken in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1949">And they -- there was all, you know, and -- and there was some -- for instance, farmers for the boys.</sentence><sentence id="1950">The older people -- the older, they didn't take.</sentence><sentence id="1951">If a farmer had couple boys, especially boys, they used to take them to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, to work on the <span class="DLF">German farms</span>, because you know, they needed help.</sentence><sentence id="1952">All <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> [indecipherable] all -- they can use all the -- all the -- all the men -- all the men they could.</sentence><sentence id="1953">So they can get cheap labor, so they tried farmers, get the -- get those farmer's boys to shf -- go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1954">Now, they didn't want to go and they knew the <span class="REGION">territory</span>, see?</sentence><sentence id="1955">Thes -- they went in in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1956">And -- and they stayed in -- you know, sometimes in the night they" ll go back to their parents and find out.</sentence><sentence id="1957">So -- so there was all kind of groups there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and this is the first -- the first friend we met at two -- a Russian -- they were Russian Bitar, so they said, "Well, try and get some arms, or get some money and maybe we can, you know, if you get some ar -- money we can -- we'll take you in some."</sentence><sentence id="1958">But, you know, one of the -- the -- from the -- the man from our group was responsive for this man.</sentence><sentence id="1959">He was responsible for this man I mean, actually one or two or three could have -- could have -- they would have taken it.</sentence><sentence id="1960">You know they would -- they would accept two or three, three or few, not ag -- not 50 or 100.</sentence><sentence id="1961">But you know, he wouldn't -- you we -- were responsible were sent for the Judenrat and -- and if you don't come, you were accounted for the people.</sentence><sentence id="1962">Now, if you" ll come with three less, what happened to the other three?</sentence><sentence id="1963">You know, it wa -- it -- you know, it was -- y-you had the
