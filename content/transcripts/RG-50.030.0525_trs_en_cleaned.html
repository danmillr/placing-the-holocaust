2,000.</sentence><sentence id="4149">At the same time the ti -- the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> was supposed to be two kilometers long.</sentence><sentence id="4150">Now, two kilometers long is 2,000 meters.</sentence><sentence id="4151">If you have 2,000 prisoners half starving, how can they possibly dig with just to shovel one meters worth of 20 meters across and up to two meters deep?</sentence><sentence id="4152">So something -- my numbers may not be correct, or maybe the Germans were thinking that these guys were ready to work their butts off, hoping to survive.</sentence><sentence id="4153">Anyway, So we were again posted every 20 meters.</sentence><sentence id="4154">I was on the right hand side, another guy was on the left hand side [indecipherable] both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>, and we had the weapons in our hands, and just watching them.</sentence><sentence id="4155">Now, I was very close to a group of seven, and one of the seven -- like, they were a bit separate from the others, and the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> was maybe about a meter deep, something like that, but unequally so.</sentence><sentence id="4156">And the officer group was standing a bit higher up, about 20 meters away, with Viel among them, including the commanding officer of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and they were kind of chatting and looking and chatting and I was standing.</sentence><sentence id="4157">I had to look this way, not that way, because once you're told where to guard your post you couldn't move even a foot of that.</sentence><sentence id="4158">And if you had to make a pee you have to ask for permission to leave or to turn around.</sentence><sentence id="4159">And suddenly I -- noticed that

guy, almost no face left, like blue eyes, a little sparse hair, no chest, barely moving, t-tiny, maybe around 50-ish.</sentence><sentence id="4161">And suddenly, I look -- I look at that, I hear something, there is Viel.</sentence><sentence id="4162">Oh, we had put our weapons away for lunch, then we got our weapons back, but there were still some <span class="DLF">pyramids</span> there because lunches were taken in sequence.</sentence><sentence id="4163">So Viel goes to a <span class="DLF">pyramid</span>, grabs a rifle,</sentence><sentence id="4165">14 and there could be more than three, could be four or five.</sentence><sentence id="4166">So one of the witnesses said oh, when you grab a rifle of the three, the others four fall down.</sentence><sentence id="4167">He took one of the four or five, stood up straight, aimed that and I said to myself, what -- wh -- I didn't know the word what the hell is happening, excuse me, what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="4168">And I said, well maybe he's just limbering up or something.</sentence><sentence id="4169">It was a muddy day for -- you know, springtime, mud in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> -- gri -- <span class="DLF">ditch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4170">Raises the weapon and aims towards me.</sentence><sentence id="4171">I didn't even duck because I said, what will -- and suddenly, he aims -- it doesn't take long to aim.</sentence><sentence id="4172">And so I hear the shot and the little guy just falls down.</sentence><sentence id="4173">Didn't even just hear the pop, falls down.</sentence><sentence id="4174">He kind of fell down forward, and the military law is, if you hit the chest or the heart, you always fall forward, you never fall backward.</sentence><sentence id="4175">Okay, so second shot, second guy falls down.</sentence><sentence id="4176">And then a third shot, the big guy.</sentence><sentence id="4177">And the big guy had stood up straight and he was looking at the officer, and the officer was looking at him.</sentence><sentence id="4178">The big guy had the shovel, the officer had the gun.</sentence><sentence id="4179">So the officer pulled the trigger, hits the big guy, the big guy falls down, stands up, raises his hand.</sentence><sentence id="4180">Viel aims, shoots the second time, the big guy falls down.</sentence><sentence id="4181">Stands up -- no more raised arm, stands up, still keeps on staring at Viel.</sentence><sentence id="4182">Big guy.</sentence><sentence id="4183">Legs like that.</sentence><sentence id="4184">He must have been a capo because he looked better fed than the other guys.</sentence><sentence id="4185">Viel, third time, plomp.</sentence><sentence id="4186">Was in the face, whatever, fall down in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4187">Three shots, plus two shots, five shots, three dead guys.</sentence><sentence id="4188">Foosh.</sentence><sentence

id="4224">They had problems lifting up the heavy guy, so finally the [indecipherable] got him and the one, two three, all seven, turned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> around, marched away.</sentence><sentence id="4225"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Death cart</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4226">Standard instrument of picking up the dead during the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence
