<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> will be divided between Russian and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but we felt that it is safer to go toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, especially

class="COUNTRY">country</span> and putting up the last stand against the Germans, not allowing them to come in.</sentence><sentence id="188">And that came until the day when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> capitulated.</sentence><sentence id="189">The war came to an end, and the Germans marched in.</sentence><sentence id="190">Then

id="193">It was a parade.</sentence><sentence id="194">I was not coming to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parade</span> because it's not in our <span

that time in finding a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="197">Finally, we heard that a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived at the corner not far where I was living and...uh...they were giving out bread.</sentence><sentence id="198">So naturally I was the first one of the family...the young people, me and my brother and my sis...my sister, we all runned to...to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they giving...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>...uh the bread arrived.</sentence><sentence id="199">And...uh...that's true.</sentence><sentence id="200">We saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with looking only at the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with bread, our eyes shined up that we're going to get a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="201">There was so many people were waiting in the <span class="DLF">line</span>, the bread was not given out.</sentence><sentence id="202">There were two Germans on the...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> throwing out the breads and there're...and I saw they were at that time cameras filming this whole thing, how they're throwing bread to the population.</sentence><sentence id="203">And I was also waiting to grab a loaf of bread, but...uh...somehow I was recognized by one of my neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="204">He says, "What are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="205">This is bread for the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="206">I says, "So I am here."</sentence><sentence id="207">He says, "You're a Jew."</sentence><sentence id="208">That was the first day when I was probably shocked and will never forget.</sentence><sentence id="209">I left the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">I came</sentence><sentence id="212">back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and didn't bring bread.</sentence><sentence id="213">Mine brother, he was more lucky.</sentence><sentence id="214">And my sister was more lucky.</sentence><sentence id="215">They came back with bread.</sentence><sentence id="216">Each one of them had a loaf.</sentence><sentence id="217">And I who supposedly was the good organizer...supposed to bring the bread, came back with nothing.</sentence><sentence id="218">I was very much shocked that this was said to me to a man whom I knew and he said the bread are for Poles.</sentence><sentence id="219">And all of a sudden I who grew up with ideas of Poles was hurt that...look at this, my own Polish comrade, my own Polish neighbors are calling me, "The Jew."</sentence><sentence id="220">I know that...uh...there was a note of the anti-semitism before war, but I did not see it because I didn't want see it.</sentence><sentence id="221">I only saw the goodness in the Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="222">I saw goodness in every <span class="NPIP">people</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">But I will not forget that first day when my eyes of the hunger saw the bread and just was so abused that I went back without bread.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: What then happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Then...uh...We had to come out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">And whoever was lucky, whose <span

chosen.</sentence><sentence id="302">We knew that we lost the war.</sentence><sentence id="303">What...we believed that this is not the end, that war begins, but war has to end.</sentence><sentence id="304">And we were counting on the war to...I know that the <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> joined immediately and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> joined the war immediately, and we also

was...it was winter.</sentence><sentence id="306">It was...uh...that winter it was September, it's getting cold and we had to find also not only food, but we had to find also means of...uh...of...-uh...heating and that was very problematic.</sentence><sentence id="307">What also happened...uh...we found ourselves...uh...that in the groups of</sentence><sentence id="309">the first people who ran out after September 7, most of us who belonged to organizations found all the organizations closed, which were also by decree, but not by decree, they were automatically closed because most of the Jewish leadership left.</sentence><sentence id="310">Those who had some contacts from this, and we remained without any leadership at all.</sentence><sentence id="311">Uh...Germans created a Judenrat...a Jewish...they arrested some...uh...the most prominent Jews they knew, and they created a Judenrat, and we started to be ruled as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> by the Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="312">We were not ruled anymore by the general community...uh...by the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> which was bombed in that time

id="317">And...uh...we continued the life...uh...without having any leadership.</sentence><sentence id="318">And...uh...little by little life started to get organized.</sentence><sentence id="319">It was a struggle.</sentence><sentence id="320">It was difficult, but...uh...those who still have the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and had the families..uh...it was...uh..probably...uh...much easier.</sentence><sentence id="321">We were very busy right after the bombardment in burying the dead and people were drafted...not drafted, almost volunteered...we volunteered first to clean the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to remove the dead bodies and to bring them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and...uh.. buried them.</sentence><sentence id="322">In those days we still knew the names of the people and people had individual burial.</sentence><sentence id="323">And...uh...we had to struggle for the daily life.</sentence><sentence id="324">That was the beginning of the days of the war.</sentence><sentence id="325">Uh...Finally after a month maybe or two, I saw that...uh...all my friends went to the west.</sentence><sentence id="326">I approached with the idea that I

between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> someplace, we run out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, and we run and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and there where I was able to remain for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="2461">I rented a...uh...a
