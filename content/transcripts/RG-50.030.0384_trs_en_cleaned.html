<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="574">Then I decided, maybe I'll be able to swim to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="575">So I jump into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="576">What happened is, if you take, from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and you land into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, you are much lower into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, now the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> was quite far away.</sentence><sentence id="577">So I swim a little bit and I could hardly move, so I turned around and went back.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Do you remember anything about what you were thinking during that night?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="595">A: I was, knew that obviously I am going to die from drowning and I, I was not looking forward that kind of death.</sentence><sentence id="596">So I was contemplating to cut my veins or something that is a quick death.</sentence><sentence id="597">So while I was contemplating what I'm going to do next, suddenly I see quite a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span>, fairly close, sailing in, in the, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">So I looked up and I see people on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> that moving pretty fast, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo</span>, it was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo vessel</span>, with a few people there.</sentence><sentence id="599">And they were pointing towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>, so I yelled at them, but they, they pointing toward the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="600">So I concluded they tell me to swim to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>, which I already tried.</sentence><sentence id="601">Anyway, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> goes away and then I see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with sailors coming towards me.</sentence><sentence id="602">So my conclusion was that that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span>, the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span>, the sailors on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> pointed out not to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>, but that somebody's coming.</sentence><sentence id="603">Of course they came, they picked me up into the, into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, they pick up the chief officer and the other corpse there, all three of us on, in the, in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and they took us ashore.</sentence><sentence id="604">These were sailors from the <span class="BUILDING">lighthouse</span>, which you could see it and they took us into the <span class="BUILDING">lighthouse</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
