mirror standing in the corner, but cutting off that corner, so one could hide behind it.</sentence><sentence id="2035">Well Julian s -- only heard the words, electricity, and he pointed to me to go

always.</sentence><sentence id="2037">He came in with her, and I heard her say [sighs].And he looked at the ri-- lamps or something, checked.</sentence><sentence id="2038">And when he left, she came in and she says, good work guys.</sentence><sentence id="2039">The first 10 months, because we accumulate a lot of things, of clothing in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, she would sell it for us, and we would give her the money for the food.</sentence><sentence id="2040">Well, after 10 months, my things have run out, and I told her, we don't have any money any more.</sentence><sentence id="2041">So she was -- she was very good about it.</sentence><sentence id="2042">When he didn't see, she would open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and quickly push in a-- a--a-- some soup, let's say, or some bread.</sentence><sentence id="2043">We ate very little, but whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="2044">There was a</sentence><sentence id="2046"><span class="DLF">window</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was overlooking a <span class="DLF">field</span>, and a young girl would come every day with her cow to let the cow roam around.</sentence><sentence id="2047">And I wouldn't stand at the <span class="DLF">window</span> because I was afraid somebody might spot me.</sentence><sentence id="2048">So I would kneel at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and look at her.</sentence><sentence id="2049">And I would say to Julian, what I wouldn't give to be this cow.</sentence><sentence id="2050">I mean, people don't know what it means.</sentence><sentence id="2051">22 months.</sentence><sentence id="2052">She worked for a <span class="BUILDING">German place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2053">She spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="2054">She didn't know how to read it, but she spoke German, for some reason she did.</sentence><sentence id="2055">And once in awhile she would invite those German soldiers over for a party.</sentence><sentence id="2056">So I help her cook and bake.</sentence><sentence id="2057">And then we would hide in that <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2058">And she would give them enough to -- drinks to make them half drunk, and they would lie down on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2059">And when they were asleep, we would come in, go right near.</sentence><sentence id="2060">I looked at them when they were asleep, and go to other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2061">When finally the war was almost over, there was a terrible fighting between the German and the Russian armies.</sentence><sentence id="2062">Terrible fighting.</sentence><sentence id="2063">The entire <span class="BUILDING">household</span> went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, except us.</sentence><sentence id="2064">So we were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span>, and Julian kept his hands over my ears so I wouldn't hear that shooting.</sentence><sentence id="2065">When suddenly the shooting stopped, and I said to Julian, am I crazy, or did I hear a Russian words there?</sentence><sentence id="2066">At the moment when I said that, she opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she said, you are free.</sentence><sentence id="2067">The Russians are here, you can go out.</sentence><sentence id="2068">There was no joy in me.</sentence><sentence id="2069">Absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2070">So I said -- my reaction was, now I am going to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2071">And I went to sleep</sentence><sentence id="2073">without fear, once.</sentence><sentence id="2074">At least once without fear, and I slept 24 hours.</sentence><sentence id="2075">Julian went out right away.</sentence><sentence id="2076">I couldn't make myself go out for about a week.</sentence><sentence id="2077">I was afraid to face the world.</sentence><sentence id="2078">So finally we went out, one Sunday afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="2079">Beautiful, sunny afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="2080">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, where I was born, where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I didn't know a living soul.</sentence><sentence id="2081">And as we were walking, I said to Julian, where are we going?</sentence><sentence id="2082">He says, I don't know, let's just walk.</sentence><sentence id="2083">And as we were walking a man approached us.</sentence><sentence id="2084">And he saw me, and he stood there and said, I don't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="2085">Aren't you Isadore Salzburg's daughter?</sentence><sentence id="2086">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="2087">Was a lawyer, Jewish lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="2088">Said to us, where are you going?I said, I don't know, we don't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2089">He says, come with me, I just opened an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, it belonged to a Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="2090">So we went with him.</sentence><sentence id="2091">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, but it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="2092">I slept on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, Julian slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2093">And this was our first <span
