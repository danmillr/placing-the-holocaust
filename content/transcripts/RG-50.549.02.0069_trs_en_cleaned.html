<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My name is Isaac Nehama.</sentence><sentence id="12">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, April 29, ninetweent-- 1926.</sentence><sentence id="13">I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> from the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="14">I was stationed at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>, in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span>, which is the capital of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> t -- either towards the very end of October, "44, or beginning of November deg44.Approximately two or three weeks after the liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> -- actually, the Germans left <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> because the Russians were about to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and therefore their retreat would have been cut off.</sentence><sentence id="16">So the Germans essentially left <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: And when were you reunited with -- with your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: Well, [ arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> on, I remember, a Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="27">And the reason this is prominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days, sometimes they are deserted.</sentence><sentence id="28">I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> f -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that I had taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span> perhaps around four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="29">I called from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span></sentence></p><p><sentence id="32">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 3 <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and I was told to immediately come.</sentence><sentence id="33">I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span>, and when finally we were approaching our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, and my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I expected to be greeted in the <span class="DLF">street</span> by my two younger brothers, but I saw no one.</sentence><sentence id="34">In fact, there was not a single person in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And I walked up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, I rang the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">A woman came out, who I recognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span> two weeks or so previously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message from my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me, and she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back.</sentence><sentence id="37">Of course, I -- Inow know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to give me for the fare.</sentence><sentence id="38">In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I think she didn't even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai.</sentence><sentence id="39">I didn't know what to make of it, why would I have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Shabitai's</span> to see my family?</sentence><sentence id="40">So I went one more flight, and I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and she embraced me, and I was shown into their <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, and then I saw my father, and only my father, with Mr. Shabitai.</sentence><sentence id="41">I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked where is mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the youngest brother.</sentence><sentence id="42">And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">mi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that that wasn't the time to explain.</sentence><sentence id="44">They implied that I must have known that terrible things happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows -- knew where they went.</sentence><sentence id="45">That was the -- the reunion.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="49"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0069 4</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to beginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Yeah, but I have to -- to cover iv -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two weeks after my arrival.</sentence><sentence id="52">I -- in -- in the beginning of December of "44, there was a brief civil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British forces in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">And these troubles primarily occurred in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">There -- there was fighting in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured.</sentence><sentence id="55">Then, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I's -- even then we called it the events, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English parachutists, I remember their red berets.</sentence><sentence id="56">So that was the beginning of what I thought was going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> to buy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken, interrogated.</sentence><sentence id="57">They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists.</sentence><sentence id="58">I explained to them I had been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active.</sentence><sentence id="59">But it -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and eventually to <span class="REGION">Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">But very shortly, through the intervention of relatives, I was freed, and came back.</sentence><sentence id="61">So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of deg45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives.</sentence><sentence id="62">Since as soon as I finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1942, the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were closed, and I couldn't go on, and my father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large <span class="BUILDING">textile firm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">So he resumed hi-his -- his profession.</sentence><sentence id="64">Also, I must note that the apar -- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a</sentence><sentence id="66">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 5 wife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lireza</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">They were occupying half of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they couldn't be evicted, or -- or -- it was out of the question to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action.</sentence><sentence id="68">So my father and I sort of lived in half of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and Mrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another - - another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking the entrance exam to the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, which I -- this usually took place in the end of August, beginning of September.</sentence><sentence id="70">And indeed, in -- in September of 45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span>, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina moment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously to find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and -- but that's ano -- a different chapter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="94">When you were a teenager, you had been working.</sentence><sentence id="95">What was the work that you were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in June of "42.</sentence><sentence id="100">Since the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that I would simply remain idle.</sentence><sentence id="101">So I was -- my father found a job for me.</sentence><sentence id="102">Let me describe it as being the clandestine, or an illegal <span class="BUILDING">market</span> in currency.</sentence><sentence id="103">There was a -- not a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, but a clandestine <span class="BUILDING">market</span> of currency in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> during the occupation.</sentence><sentence id="104">What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins, either British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs.</sentence><sentence id="105">Occasionally -- and the</sentence><sentence id="107">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 6 only non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars.</sentence><sentence id="108">And also, occasionally, small bars of gold.</sentence><sentence id="109">So, this individual, who was originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, and who was a -- in the <span class="BUILDING">stock market</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">legal stock market</span>, he had, with his family, escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, established himself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and then started a -- an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> by himself.</sentence><sentence id="110">A <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> conducting this sort of activity.</sentence><sentence id="111">Very briefly, the way it worked, if somebody wanted to, let's say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because drachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued.</sentence><sentence id="112">The -- the value of -- th -- the price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies.</sentence><sentence id="113">For instance, while Rommel was advancing in <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span>, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold pound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated.</sentence><sentence id="114">And when, on the contrary, when the allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the -- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value other than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation.</sentence><sentence id="115">So this is what, essentially, he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="116">And my job was -- I didn't do the trades, but I had to deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let's say, 10 gold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, get the roll of coins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer.</sentence><sentence id="117">It was, let's say, a dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal.</sentence><sentence id="118">If I had been caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="119">Even conducting this sort of business was -- was illegal.</sentence><sentence id="120">So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we -- we had a number of shelves in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with textiles.</sentence><sentence id="121">Woolens, and some silks,</sentence><sentence id="123">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 7 pretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was the -- the currency.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: And was this a Jewish enterprise?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Well, it -- the man, his name was Haim Romano, happened to be a Jew from <span class="REGION">Salonika</span>, but th-the traders were both Christian Greeks, as well as Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="157">And when you mention your neighbors in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above, were -- were they Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="158">And I know that your parents sort of social network was generally family contacts.</sentence><sentence id="159">I think people they knew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monisteer</span>, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Relatives.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: -- it was a -- a Jewish world in which they led their lives, would you say?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="164">Well, and the Shabitais were Jews, but they were not Sephardim.</sentence><sentence id="165">Mr. and Mrs. Shabitai -- Mrs. Shabitai was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yarninar</span>, and Mr. Shabitai was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trikola</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">Both of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as Greek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were not descendants of the Jews who were expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> in 1492.</sentence><sentence id="167">In contrast, my parents on both sides -- both of them were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span>, traced their ancestry to the Sephardim who left <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, and eventually ended up in that part of the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span>, which was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="174">Do you think that your group had any -- was there a Sephardim look?</sentence><sentence id="175">I mean would -- could you -- could you say that you were slight in build, and dark, and - - I mean, is -- was there a difference between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazis?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="182"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0069 8</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Do you see any difference?</sentence><sentence id="184">No, no, I -- I -- I don't recall -- really I think that I couldn't distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our relatives, and other Greeks.</sentence><sentence id="185">They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean look, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration.</sentence><sentence id="186">Of course, a -- a -- you -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or southern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people.</sentence><sentence id="187">But there were a few there, but otherwise there were no such characteristics of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sephardim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">The thing that was distinguishing, of course was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother, who would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt -- a sister of my mother's, that's the only language that she understood, and we had to speak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="196">Was Ladino your mother tongue?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Not mine.</sentence><sentence id="200">Mine was, well dual, Greek primarily because of my friends and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> it was obligatory to speak French, bo -- my mother was a teacher of French, and my father had studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in French.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: But you don't know what you spoke first as a child, or -- or fr -- from the very beginning?</sentence><sentence id="204">Perhaps you were speaking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span> and French right from infancy on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I -- I don't believe that I spoke <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">Perhaps, before I began to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I believe, and I -- I seem to -- I recollect that I spoke to my parents in French.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: I'm backing away now and coming -- thinking again of your father at this time.</sentence><sentence id="212">Do you have a sense of how he was coping?</sentence><sentence id="213">I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="220">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 9 point, he had lost his wife and two sons.</sentence><sentence id="221">Do you have a sense of what gave him strength, and what his state of mind was?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it very often.</sentence><sentence id="223">Or in discussions I have with people.</sentence><sentence id="224">And I always have to remind myself and my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part of the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate things, with y-young children.</sentence><sentence id="225">I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- I ca -- I recollect from cousins that they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents, after they themselves had matured, and were married.</sentence><sentence id="226">So I don't think that there was, let's say, reluctance.</sentence><sentence id="227">My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very seldom, 0-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high holidays in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monasteer</span>, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this.</sentence><sentence id="228">A episode of things like this.</sentence><sentence id="229">But not very much about personal life.</sentence><sentence id="230">But coming back to your question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I told him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Greek mountains</span> with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly superficial.</sentence><sentence id="231">We didn't go into -- into that.</sentence><sentence id="232">Knowing my father as I recollect him, he was an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he had a club foot.</sentence><sentence id="233">So he was always hobbled.</sentence><sentence id="234">He always wor -- wor -- walked with a cane.</sentence><sentence id="235">But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely.</sentence><sentence id="236">I think you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="237">So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that</sentence><sentence id="239">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0069 10 time, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return.</sentence><sentence id="240">We -- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April "45, so the pictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was still totally unknown.</sentence><sentence id="241">So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although very, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back.</sentence><sentence id="242">And the focus, therefore, was I think a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best we could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for taking the exams.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="267">You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his admonishing you to not be taken by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="268">And I think he spoke of that, I'm assuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">And you were the oldest, and you'd had your Bar Mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="270">And times were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open in what he said to you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
