And we went back to - it was in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> - went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learned from four "til six.</sentence><sentence id="65">And at six o'clock, my mother would give me like a nickel or a dime and I would buy myself a roll of butter with a piece of herring, some nights with cheese, and go back to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">It was like a ..... (ph), and there we will try to do our homework.</sentence><sentence id="67">Work mostly in the Talmud what we learn in our , and then we drop them in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">We did not have the radio in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">I recall we had like a <span class="INT_SPACE">three room apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">three room apartment</span> we slept uh two in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and there was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> that was, they opened up.</sentence><sentence id="72">One child will sleep, one brother with the head one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the other one will sleep with the head the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, so their feet will - so that was more convenient to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="73">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, then a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and my father and mother slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> with the younger children.</sentence><sentence id="74">We seemed always to have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> if somebody else came over to sleep over.</sentence><sentence id="75">We did not have the toys that the uh - what we used to do, we couldn't even afforded to buy uh rubber ball, because I played soccer - when I had a little chance, I play I liked to play soccer, so we would take some rags, roll them them up, sew them up like in when it was finished looked almost like a baseball with the stitches - that's what we would kick around.</sentence><sentence id="76">Very seldom it has a bounce.</sentence><sentence id="77">But we had a very, maybe we didn't see anything better, but we were very happy childhood.</sentence><sentence id="78">And everything uh everybody was looking forward, we knew there were things getting bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> cause since uh when I start to recognize and understand certain things, that in 1935, "36, when the Marshall of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, Marshall Pilsudski, had died, the anti-Semitism because maybe they wanted, the Poles want to be friendly with the Germans or maybe that was in fashion like they say, anti-Semitism had start growing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to a very untolerable situation.</sentence><sentence id="79">But we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow Kazimierz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">And it was strictly... It was called the Kazimierz, after the Kazimierz, the great King Kazimierz who let the Jews come into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> with so many hundred years back.</sentence><sentence id="81">And in , mostly was Jewish, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>, Jewish shopkeepers, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogues</span>, so I personally did not have any connection, special connection with gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="82">We had our own life.</sentence><sentence id="83">Of course we learned in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Polish but uh we did not come in any contact and we, our business and our daily life had no mingling with the Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="84">And there was, I overheard all our politicking was going on in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">And I overheard the, as a child 1 liked to listen that the uh some young people were and they were screaming to the older people that Hitler may be coming and conquer <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> - we have to do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="86">And I don't know from the olderies (ph) first of all we were told, respect the elder people.</sentence><sentence id="87">When an elder person spoke, we were quiet.</sentence><sentence id="88">We only listened.</sentence><sentence id="89">We wouldn't dare even answer them anything.</sentence><sentence id="90">So they say that they remember the Germans from World War I.They are cultured.</sentence><sentence id="91">They're intelligent and the argument was going with some, we would come and that after all, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf, and he's out to destroy the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="92">So they gave in.</sentence><sentence id="93">They say Hitler's a maniac, but the German people will definite not come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">They will never hurt us.</sentence><sentence id="95">And then for what reason should they hurt us.</sentence><sentence id="96">We are Polish citizens.</sentence><sentence id="97">We are law-abiding citizens.</sentence><sentence id="98">And why would they hurt us?So that was the, maybe now if for a Monday morning quarterback, maybe it's, it was their wishful thinking, because the average family was eight, ten and even twelve people in a family.</sentence><sentence id="99">Mostly, ninety percent or more, were very poor, hardly eking out a living.</sentence><sentence id="100">Nobody had a, they may had a little uh piece of ring or piece of gold, some silverware, but wealth, currency - very few Jews had because they had always to borrow when it came a sabbath or when it came a high holiday, or any holidays if they want to prepare a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> they had to go out and borrow some money, so currency nobody had.</sentence><sentence id="101">And it was very hard for a family of eight or ten to go - nobody, no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world would take them, and of course we did not have the state or vision (ph), so there was uh their wishful thinking that uh maybe there would be no war and maybe they were sure that the Germans would not have the audacity, have the nerve to do those things that Hitler's asking them to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: What happened when the war did break out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: But in 1939, we were first worried that my father may be taken to the army.</sentence><sentence id="160">He was born in 1900, and he was only 39 years old.</sentence><sentence id="161">But a few weeks before the war broke out, they changed the slip of paper - the there were red cards, blue cards, white cards, and there was must have been that day because of having seven children - the youngest child was four years old when the war broke out - that they did not call him to the army.</sentence><sentence id="162">And the war broke out on September 1, 1939, on a Friday morning.</sentence><sentence id="163">To me, I didn't know what's in store.</sentence><sentence id="164">To me it wasn't the most uh important thing.</sentence><sentence id="165">To me it was more important we had uh a championship going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Macabi</span>, the soccer team, and that was important to me, but on Wednesday morning I went out near the outskirts from the Wis_a [NB: the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>].</sentence><sentence id="166"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wis_a</span> is the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> [NB: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>] that runs through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I went over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to Mos, Mostowa (ph) and I saw already Germans.</sentence><sentence id="168">So I ran back to my dad because my dad received then to go into the army, to be in the next few days near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> at a certain post.</sentence><sentence id="169">So I screamed to and I told my dad don't go because the Germans are already here.</sentence><sentence id="170">And the Germans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> on Wednesday.</sentence><sentence id="171">That was September the 6th.</sentence><sentence id="172">And to say they didn't bother us, we didn't bother them.</sentence><sentence id="173">But the first brutality I saw on the high holidays - I liked to run from one <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>, from one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or one <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> to the other <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> to listen to the cantor singing, and as I was going in the <span class="DLF">street</span> on the , most of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> had open <span class="DLF">doors</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and Germans came in and they happened to be Wehrmacht.</sentence><sentence id="174">They were not SS.</sentence><sentence id="175">I learned later about SS.</sentence><sentence id="176"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plain Wehrmacht</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">Went into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, pulled out the Jews, older people, took the thales, the skrols, throw it in the garbage, ripped it up and literally they say that they took out the Jews to shave their beards and their [side]locks, and literally I saw them ripping - blood was gushing from their faces from the people and they were laughing and they were smile and then I realized that something is wrong somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="178">That I couldn't believe my own eyes, what I saw, and we made up our mind at that time, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had built-in <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> so we built in a <span class="DLF">double wall</span>, and we hide our father, because our father still had a beard, and we and he didn't want to shave his beard because of the high holidays.</sentence><sentence id="179">And we were afraid in case my father will go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> he will be recognized as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="180">So we did all our, whatever work we, whatever little business, whatever to sustain our family, my older brother, myself and my younger two brothers, we did our dealings, and it was till maybe October or November when the first snow came on the on the , not only the snow on Ka...on our <span class="DLF">street</span> - it's snowing all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, maybe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> too, but the first snowstorm - they closed off the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they start going door to <span class="DLF">door</span>, only to Jewish families in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and it couldn't go through my mind - there were calling us Jews with lice, Juden (ph), dirty Jews.</sentence><sentence id="181">Yet so nice they asked if you have a ring.</sentence><sentence id="182">My mother had a little ring, a little candelabra for lighting the candles on shabbat, a little piece of - they took everything away.</sentence><sentence id="183">On some occasions, people said that they even give them a little paper that they took it, enough that they was going to give it back to them.</sentence><sentence id="184">But I was one of the boys that they took down to the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and they make bundles - everybody makes for himself a bundle and roll down to his mother, the soldiers, yeah, to his mother - that that was already SS.There was difference because normally the Wehrmacht will be the fighters and the SS will be the administrators.</sentence><sentence id="185">So I saw that they uh in here to rob us with everything we got, but yet we didn't, we didn't care so much.</sentence><sentence id="186">We were never hang up on, we didn't have wealth and we were not hanged up on the piece of stuff that we lost.</sentence><sentence id="187">To us it was important, the family.</sentence><sentence id="188">As long as we stayed whole.</sentence><sentence id="189">But every few weeks new laws came out.</sentence><sentence id="190">Laws that a Jew has to wear on his right arm an arm band with the Star of David.</sentence><sentence id="191">If you were caught without it, you were subject to being shot.</sentence><sentence id="192">We didn't pay too much attention.</sentence><sentence id="193">I was a blonde boy, blue eyes, spoke a perfect Polish, and I was little.</sentence><sentence id="194">I was never a tall boy.</sentence><sentence id="195">So I could pass for below twelve.</sentence><sentence id="196">I didn't carry no papers with me so I kept on screaming if somebody asked me why didn't you wear the star, I was saying I'm not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="197">And again we worried only about our father and every time they passed a new law, a Jew has to do this, and above everything, when they came in they start confiscating <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">And I'm not talking about the Poppa and Momma store, little <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> or little <span class="BUILDING">luncheonette</span> but stores of meaning - textiles, shoes, col...colonial - that is coffee and tea, some specialities and of course the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">And in most cases they took away Jewish out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kazmierz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">They took out <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> and they took it away for them, from them.</sentence><sentence id="201">They tell them that they need it for their administrative group.</sentence><sentence id="202">And the more high ranked you were in the list by the Gestapo or by the SS, a bigger <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or a bigger <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> you receive.</sentence><sentence id="203">In that case, <span class="BUILDING">Oskar Schindler</span> received the biggest <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, the Patzenpen (ph) factory.</sentence><sentence id="204">I get back to that later on, but let me tell you about the family.</sentence><sentence id="205">In March of 1940, things start to go very bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">My father had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_arew</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">That's near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, and he wrote us food is better, you can get better food in the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> than in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so he took his whole family and he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_arew</span> except myself.</sentence><sentence id="208">I stayed to watch the belongings in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and I stayed there for a few months and what's happening while those were coming out, then from time to time they fooled the people and they start loosen up a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="209">So there was talk - we only lived by rumors, so there were rumors that the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> can come back.</sentence><sentence id="210">So by July, my parents and the children came back.</sentence><sentence id="211">In August, the beginning of August, they asked us to be, to register.</sentence><sentence id="212">If we register and they like the idea who we are, what we are, we will have the privilege to go in in March, it was already written down that in March of 1941 it will be established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">And only if you worthy you going to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">If you're not worthy, you'll be shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="215">My father registered, and that was a part of fooling the people.</sentence><sentence id="216">If you register, then they know you are, they know your <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">My father registered and my mother registered and that was some papers that I found in the Warsaw archives after the war, and in 1941, like in February, I went out again to get some food for the family, and a Polish policeman grabbed me.</sentence><sentence id="218">And he said, "Why are you here so early?</sentence><sentence id="219">You must be Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="220">And I kept saying, "No, I'm not Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="221">So he took me to...he said, "Let's find out if you're Jewish or not."</sentence><sentence id="222">And he took me to the Gestapo and they pulled my pants down.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I... They start asking me where I live, and I didn't want to give up my family, give out my family.</sentence><sentence id="224">So I stayed and I said uh whatever will happen will happen; and one of the Gestapo came out and he says to the Polish policeman, there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> full of Jews that they are being deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_a Podlaska</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">That was on the <span class="REGION">east side</span>, near the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where the Russians took part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span>--near that <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">And he even used the word: "Take that little scheiss and put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>."</sentence><sentence id="228">So I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">I was very happy to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">And I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_a Podlaska</span>; and I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a letter and saying, "Dad and Ma - I can escape because nobody's watching me.</sentence><sentence id="231">Should I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="232">I'm coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="233">So I immediately got back a letter not to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, that they were already marked also to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="234">They were not accepted to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because my father had no trade.</sentence><sentence id="235">And very seldom do they took seven, a family of with seven, eight, nine people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">They took to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> young people with one child or two children and those who worked for the uh they can show papers and those special papers was called the , and if they got the , that means if you work, then you could go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">Many people had signed up to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory Emailia</span>, NKF [NB: Neue Kiihler- und Flugzeugteile-Fabrik] by Schindler.</sentence><sentence id="238">People paid, they signed out if they own a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, diamonds, whatever they could lay their hands on, to get those papers to be able to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">My father and mother and the six children was sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [Podlaski].</sentence><sentence id="240"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [Podlaski], from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_a Podlaska</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is no more than twenty-one kilometer.</sentence><sentence id="241">That's about fifteen miles.</sentence><sentence id="242">And one morning, I'm walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and I see my father . [</sentence><sentence id="243">said to my father, "What are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="244">He said, "Come.</sentence><sentence id="245">I came to take you <span

id="247">So we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podlaski</span>], and we were told then the reason we are sent in this direction of the east that the <span class="DLF">fields</span> are more fertilized.</sentence><sentence id="248">It's easier to feed the people.</sentence><sentence id="249">And we were hoping that this is the case.</sentence><sentence id="250">And that was April, May; and my brother and myself were assigned to work for the Germans, to cut the furrows and to make <span class="DLF">roads</span> for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aeroplanes</span>, to make <span class="DLF">aeroplane fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">Because the Germans had in their mind to start to attack the

class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">The fact is while we were walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, about ten kilometers, we were stopping at a farmer, exchange - money was not worth anything - but exchange for little something.</sentence><sentence id="254">He would give us some potatoes, some corn, some food.</sentence><sentence id="255">And that's how we sustain ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="256">When the war broke out on June 22nd, they tell us we cannot go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">And they start putting wires around us and they said they are making a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">And they need our work.</sentence><sentence id="259">They need to load up some stuff

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">Maybe we can pass for Aryan.</sentence><sentence id="266">We're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">So we start by foot.</sentence><sentence id="268">And when we came in like half-way, near the Wis_a; and I was stuck in in &gt; <span class="BUILDING" lat="50.301032" long="20.807445">Nowy Korczyn</span>, in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="269">My brother was stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staszow</span>, by a family.</sentence><sentence id="270">I had no food to eat, so during that time, it was like in July, there were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> some green apples, and I ate those green apples and I have uh (ph)_ diarrhea and I got very sick, so I was going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and finally near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowy Korcezyn</span> there was a Polish family who needed a shepherd boy.</sentence><sentence id="271">They had cows.</sentence><sentence id="272">And I said, "I will do it.</sentence><sentence id="273">I don't want no money.</sentence><sentence id="274">Only thing I want is to get a little better and get some potatoes, uh cooked potatoes, so...so my stomach will get better."</sentence><sentence id="275">And meantime, in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miedzyrzec</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Podlaski</span>], my family was starving.</sentence><sentence id="276">There was no food.</sentence><sentence id="277">There was no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="278">So my father put on clothes like uh...like a man [who] was a farmer, and he got himself a a paper that he is uh like a Polish farmer.</sentence><sentence id="279">And he went back to his brother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_arew</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">And my mother took five children, dressed like a peasant girl, took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">And when she came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, the <span class="DLF">gates</span> for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed off.</sentence><sentence id="282">We had an uncle in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so he sent out somebody.</sentence><sentence id="283">And he said, "The best thing for you is to go like twenty-five, thirty kilometer.</sentence><sentence id="284">Near...there's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.190729" long="20.29167">Proszowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">Near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.190729" long="20.29167">Proszowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">You can go there and get from a farmer a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for you for your family."</sentence><sentence id="287">So she did that.</sentence><sentence id="288">She had a few zlotys--that's Polish currency--and she rented; and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stagniowice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">So in 1941, maybe it was September, October, she rented a one-room apartment.</sentence><sentence id="290">And my father couldn't stand uh being without his wife and children, so from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">O_arew</span> he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staszow</span> and collected my younger brother, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staszow</span> they come to [Nowy] Korczyn.</sentence><sentence id="291">We wrote letters to each other into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to my uncle, Isaac Levenstein (ph), who was my mother's brother.</sentence><sentence id="292">He stayed with his wife and two children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">He had...he happened to have in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> from before the war that was like Brillos, but without the soap, and he maked those Brillos for the soldiers, for the for the German army.</sentence><sentence id="294">So he had the privilege, him and another partner, to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">So we had our con...contact through that uncle, so my father knew by which farmer I was uh near Nowy Korczyn, and it was after the holiday, high holiday, and he collected me and we all went and we finally hooked up together with my mother and she was there with five children.</sentence><sentence id="296">And we were all nine again together from 1941, by October; and was the happiest days of our life.</sentence><sentence id="297">In one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, nothing to eat.</sentence><sentence id="298">And the greatest pain that I can see, when my mother was cooking some food (crying) and she would say she's not hungry.</sentence><sentence id="299">We knew she was hungry, but she wouldn't allow herself to have a little food because she wouldn't take it away from her children.</sentence><sentence id="300">We...again we had to register in the Jewish because to get some rationing, some food.</sentence><sentence id="301">Without it we couldn't sustain ourselves, so towards the end of 1941, they say that for to feed our family, one, a male, especially the husband, the men in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, has to go to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lager camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">So my brother said he will go, to save our father.</sentence><sentence id="303">So my brother went.</sentence><sentence id="304">The end of "41 he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U lag</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">In March of 1942, they said they need more men to go to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">So again we want to save our father.</sentence><sentence id="308">So I went.</sentence><sentence id="309">And in 1942 I came to a <span class="BUILDING">factory of bricks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">I could have escaped.</sentence><sentence id="311">Was easy to escape, but they hold our family hostage.</sentence><sentence id="312">If we would escape, they knew where our family lived, so for the love for our family, we gladly stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">It wasn't so terrible.</sentence><sentence id="314">So we all always lived with the idea, the Russian...the Russians already fighting with the Germans, the British, the French, that an end will come very soon.</sentence><sentence id="315">And to sustain ourselves and to also help out the uncle in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that I mentioned to you, my two brothers and a sister also blonde, blue-eyes, will go by little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> - that was a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, not a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> - will go from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and they will smuggle into the ghetto flour, bread, eggs sometimes - whatever they could lay their hands.</sentence><sentence id="316">Even sometimes a piece of meat, and they will bring it to the uncle.</sentence><sentence id="317">The uncle normally will have it for himself.</sentence><sentence id="318">Sometimes he will sell it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, that stuff, and from that my parents lived.</sentence><sentence id="319">In 1942 they start liquidating all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">And maybe it was luck and maybe it was not luck, they forgot about us.</sentence><sentence id="321">We were on the outskirts from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.190729" long="20.29167">Proszowice</span>, and maybe nobody put up a list on it.</sentence><sentence id="322">And they...they made, it was called visedlenie (ph).</sentence><sentence id="323">That means taking the people out.</sentence><sentence id="324">There was always, they always take out some people and the rest they left over because they said we need you.</sentence><sentence id="325">So the, now the hindsight, the Monday morning quarterback, I would understand that they took out the men so the women and the children could not put up the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="326">When they had us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they make <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> already, and they change it from a regular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">Tell me you had no choice to fight.</sentence><sentence id="328">You couldn't fight.</sentence><sentence id="329">You couldn't escape.</sentence><sentence id="330">So in 1942, in the meantime, they open up a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, what's called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow-P_aszow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">It was old Ierozolimska (ph).</sentence><sentence id="332">It was a new <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and it was called Ierozolimska (ph) and that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">So on that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, they build <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>--factories, that they make shoes, uniforms, brushes, whatever they could get the work out from the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="334">The knit...<span class="BUILDING">knitting factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">They make sweaters, socks.</sentence><sentence id="336">And they prepared this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="337">So from the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U lag</span>, I myself with my brother were united...with my older brother; and we stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="338">In the first there was an Obersturmfiihrer Miller (ph).</sentence><sentence id="339">He wasn't so bad.</sentence><sentence id="340">And it wasn't so bad "til on a Friday in 1942, it must have been like September, when Amon Goeth took over that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="341">In the first, it was on a Friday morning - I will never forget that.</sentence><sentence id="342">When he took over that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they took us from that <span class="NPIP">place</span>--it was called "appellplatz"--the place that they count us.</sentence><sentence id="343">Every day, they count us like we would be worth a fortune.</sentence><sentence id="344">And...and in that moment, Goeth took out...There was, we was run by Jewish police.</sentence><sentence id="345">The SS was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and inside in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was only a few SS people.</sentence><sentence id="346">But most was run by Jewish police, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jewish kapos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">So they took out, he took out the leader from the Jewish police, Katz, and his second his in command, Goldberg, and they shot them both on the spot, Katz and Goldberg.</sentence><sentence id="348">So I start seeing the brutality of Amon Goeth, and he said I'm going to shoot every Jew if you're not going to obey, if you're not going to work diligently, so in that time I I saw that we are in for a lot a lot of trouble.</sentence><sentence id="349">In the meantime at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in 1942 after the high holidays, they found out there were people hiding and they would start cleaning up when they had finished the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">The smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, they start going to the outskirts, and my father saw from far away that some Germans are coming with some, that some people, there's a lot of horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, there's a lot of things going on, so he pushed out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a brother right after me and another one and and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="351">They pushed them out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he said tun.</sentence><sentence id="352">So they run into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">They knew their way to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so they run into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="354">My father and mother and the youngest sister and the youngest brother, they took to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miechow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miechow</span>, they had at that time maybe eighty or ninety Jews altogether.</sentence><sentence id="356">So they asked the men to stay on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and the women and children on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">They didn't know what they're going to do, but my father will not have it.</sentence><sentence id="358">He said, "I will not leave my wife or with two children.</sentence><sentence id="359">Whatever will happen to her, will happen to me."</sentence><sentence id="360">They took the men out in the side and they asked one, always will ask the the commander, what should we do with them.</sentence><sentence id="361">So they said, "It's not enough people to make a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">Shoot them on the spot."</sentence><sentence id="363">And they killed my father and mother.</sentence><sentence id="364">One was holding one child in the hand and one was holding the other child in the hand.</sentence><sentence id="365">I know it for a fact, because two days later the men who were segregated were brought into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and they were crying like little babies, that they left their family.</sentence><sentence id="366">They felt the guilt.</sentence><sentence id="367">It was the murderers who put them to that <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">Because after all, we are taught that life is so precious, that life with force you are born and with force you must die.</sentence><sentence id="369">You cannot take your own life, that life by Jewish people is very precious.</sentence><sentence id="370">But they knew my father.</sentence><sentence id="371">They knew my mother.</sentence><sentence id="372">And that was the beginning of that I lost my father and mother and a brother and a sister.</sentence><sentence id="373">And in the meantime, I was with my older brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="374">In 194...and I building <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">We were building <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="376">We were building <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">It was, we were in two different groups.</sentence><sentence id="378">They normally separated so first we were in one group but then we were in separate groups.</sentence><sentence id="379">Every group had fifty peo...boys.</sentence><sentence id="380">And with fifty boys went a Jewish kapo.</sentence><sentence id="381">In 1943, in March, beginning of March, they liquidated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">My two brothers and sister did not have papers.</sentence><sentence id="383">They they were not legally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so they hide.</sentence><sentence id="384">They hid and they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on a Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="385">I think it was March llth.</sentence><sentence id="386">And by Wednesday, and they brought in all the people.</sentence><sentence id="387">And one occasion I I will forget that - the women were coming out and one woman had in her knapsack a little baby.</sentence><sentence id="388">And the little baby was crying, and the German heard...heard the baby crying, and he killed the baby and the mother on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="389">Shot them on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="390">And our group from were taken to right on Sunday they start cleaning out those people who had no papers and those people who were hide, they were bringing up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszow</span>, and we, the boys, had to take them down - some of them were complete dead, some was not dead - in one case I saw a girl, a young child that wasn't dead, and we asked the German give the girl, give her ,aaa a thing of mercy, so we wouldn't bury her alive.</sentence><sentence id="391">So he said, shmutzige, shit (ph), he said, throw it just in the way it is and it's it's it's a shot (ph) to throw in, to waste a bullet on that piece of uh you know what I'm talking about.</sentence><sentence id="392">And my uncle was taken into the P_aszew (ph) and he left in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> his wife and two children to be hidden, for the children were not legal.</sentence><sentence id="393">And my bro...two brothers and a sister were there too, and every day, every night when I come back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, he would say did you see any familiar faces.</sentence><sentence id="394">And every day, every time I look at a corpse that looks a little bit similar, I turned it around to see if it's any of my family.</sentence><sentence id="395">Till on Wednesday that week, they brought in my brother and a sister.</sentence><sentence id="396">And I found out later that one brother escaped.</sentence><sentence id="397">How he escaped is beyond me, but he had escaped and he was walking around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="398">My brother and sister were, mind you, they probably were hungary so they left the ghe...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were on the <span class="DLF">road</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> already on the bottom, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not watched anymore by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="399">It was watched by the Poles because it was all quiet.</sentence><sentence id="400">The only thing they did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is to look.</sentence><sentence id="401">Maybe people put some wealth in the <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">They start looking and maybe they thought somebody was hidden.</sentence><sentence id="403">They took boys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">P_aszew</span> to look over and to check out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if nobody is there.</sentence><sentence id="404">But they themselves were finished with the all the brutal work that they done.</sentence><sentence id="405">And two Polish policemen killed my brother and sister.</sentence><sentence id="406">And I know it for a fact, because I... people told me that.
