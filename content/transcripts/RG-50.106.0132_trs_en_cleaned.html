<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: Not very religious.</sentence><sentence id="88">We did -- we -- we -- we were part of the Jewish community and we did go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, but only on high holidays.</sentence><sentence id="89">On the other hand, we did have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span>, supposedly for the staff, to honor them.</sentence><sentence id="90">I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">I tried to find the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, but the only <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> that we located was one that was closed.</sentence><sentence id="92">And later on when I talked to one of my distant relatives, I was told that there were several <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> and that probably was not the one that I attended as a child.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Would you say that your parents were overly protective, or was this the usual way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: That -- that was the usual way that the governesses and in the circle of friends that we grew up with.</sentence><sentence id="184">But y -- then most of the -- I -- I can't remember why we did not go to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, but most of the children of my fr -- of my father's and mother's friends did attend <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">We did go to a <span class="BUILDING">private dancing school</span>, and we did have piano lessons in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a piano teacher.</sentence><sentence id="186">But I -- and I also remember coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we had the governesses that were supposed to instruct us in</sentence><sentence id="188">French and English, but we also had some kind of a tutor come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the languages.</sentence><sentence id="189">But nothing much came of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: My sister was very domineering, very bossy, and my father clearly always favored my sister, which was a big problem for me as a child because I felt he was very unjust.</sentence><sentence id="201">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> the oldest child had a lot of privileges that the younger child didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="202">So I was very annoyed at that.</sentence><sentence id="203">She was allowed to go at night to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span>, I was not.</sentence><sentence id="204">She was allowed to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> later, I was not.</sentence><sentence id="205">She was allowed a lot of fe -- also, I had a lot of hand-me-down dresses from her, which I terribly resented.</sentence><sentence id="206">And I always wanted to have the same clothes as she did, I was dreaming of her being left back in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so we could be in the same grade.</sentence><sentence id="207">Things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: I think as a young child I didn't feel either way.</sentence><sentence id="343">I really didn't.</sentence><sentence id="344">I was much more preoccupied of what was happening at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my sister, with my cousin, with -- with the governesses, who really f -- always favored my sister because she was quiet and I was very noisy.</sentence><sentence id="345">I still remember my father saying, we can only hear one child in this whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that's me.</sentence><sentence id="346">And I -- I remember I was very grega -- gregarious.</sentence><sentence id="347">I know we were re -- presented when -- whenever my father and my</sentence><sentence id="349">mother had big social affairs in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the evening, we were all dressed up and presented, and I loved that, because everybody made a fuss over me.</sentence><sentence id="350">And then of course, my sister hated to go and she was forced to go.</sentence><sentence id="351">And I also remember that my sister was allowed to have long curls and I was not because my mother felt all the attention went to me and not to my sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: What was your relationship with your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: Very close.</sentence><sentence id="366">I'm -- since my father favored so much my sister, my mother favored me.</sentence><sentence id="367">But truthfully, while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, we were very little involved with either parent.</sentence><sentence id="368">We were strictly with the governess and there were maybe not -- just maybe at the mealtime, the main mealtime at noon, that we sometimes ate with them, not always.</sentence><sentence id="369">And on Saturday and Sunday, I remember a little bit of my father playing with us, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="370">A very little, very little interplay.</sentence><sentence id="371">And then the summer we hardly ever saw them because they went on trips from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we always went to for the summer, which was a small <span class="REGION">estate</span> where we rented a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
