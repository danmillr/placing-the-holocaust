Okay.</sentence><sentence id="34">Ijust want to do one thing.</sentence><sentence id="35">I'm afraid my alarm on my watch is going to go off, so let me try to figure out how to make it go off.</sentence><sentence id="36">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="37">I'm going to put it <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">Why don't you cut for a second.</sentence><sentence id="39">Now I want you to tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> after the war broke out and where you and your family lived and about what you remember of the forming of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">Tell me a little bit about before you were deported.</sentence><sentence id="41">A. We lived all our lives on <span class="DLF">Miller Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">This is the <span class="DLF">Miller Street</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the resistance were on <span class="BUILDING">Miller 18</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">We lived on <span class="BUILDING">Miller 38</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">We never moved, so we were lucky in that respect.</sentence><sentence id="45">Before the war, my father had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of wooden hand-carved objects, like carved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and carved boxes, decorative plates, and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="46">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, my father applied to the Germans to have a permit for a workshop, and he received a permit to make wooden frames.</sentence><sentence id="47">He received the location just across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from where we lived, an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">And one day, he told my sister and me to go over to that <span class="NPIP">location</span> and put the frames in to make it look occupied.</sentence><sentence id="49">The reason for this permit, as you know, was that anybody who was not employed was subject to transport and anybody that had any kind of a piece of paper could, quote, postpone the transport, and this was the reason for it.</sentence><sentence id="50">So my sister and I, loaded with this wooden frames, go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to put the things in.</sentence><sentence id="51">And all of a sudden, there is a <span class="DLF">blockade</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54"><span class="DLF">Blockade</span> means that the German, Polish and Jewish police block off, cordoned off a <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">There are whistles, there are screams, there are yelling.</sentence><sentence id="56">This means that everybody that is going to be caught is going to be transported out.</sentence><sentence id="57">My sister and I are in this empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, there is screaming and yelling and whistling.</sentence><sentence id="58">So we run from this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">We want to go into a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">A <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> is a hiding place that each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had to try and hide and wait out and maybe be saved.</sentence><sentence id="61">We run there with all the other people, but we were strangers in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, they didn't know us, so they wouldn't let us in.</sentence><sentence id="62">My sister and I went back upstairs to this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, I believe it was on the first or second story, completely empty.</sentence><sentence id="63">We sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we wait, see what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="64">And there are screams and yelling on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and people crying.</sentence><sentence id="65">There are shots, a great deal of noise, and screaming "raus, raus, raus," which means out, out, out, everybody out.</sentence><sentence id="66">And we sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we tell each other jokes just to keep our spirits up and to give each other courage.</sentence><sentence id="67">All of a sudden, we hear heavy steps on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>, boom, boom, boom, "raus, raus, raus."</sentence><sentence id="68">And somebody, with the butt of a rifle, opens the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">And it so happens that we were sitting behind the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">We didn't even know that.</sentence><sentence id="71">The <span class="DLF">door</span> is open, a soldier's head comes in, he sees the empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, goes out, goes up, goes down.</sentence><sentence id="72">And we are there.</sentence><sentence id="73">And I don't know how long we sat there, until everything was quiet.</sentence><sentence id="74">And we waited, and we peeked through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and there was nobody there.</sentence><sentence id="75">We made it downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="76">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was open.</sentence><sentence id="77">There was nobody there.</sentence><sentence id="78">We felt as the last inhabitants on earth, the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="79">We run across the <span class="DLF">street</span> where my mother was.</sentence><sentence id="80">We had the keys, we opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">She was there.</sentence><sentence id="82">She survived.</sentence><sentence id="83">She didn't hear.</sentence><sentence id="84">After that, there was no point of having this workshop.</sentence><sentence id="85">This was in July "42, as you know, that the big, big transports from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, to death.</sentence><sentence id="86">My father, again, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the <span class="INT_SPACE">workshop</span>, but still you needed some kind of a piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="87">My father registered as a</sentence><sentence id="89">woodcarver and he received a job.</sentence><sentence id="90">His job was -- this was in the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">The Germans have experienced great many losses in the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">They brought the wounded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">And those that died were buried there in the <span class="DLF">German military cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">My father's job was to carve the names, the ranks and the date of birth and death of the fallen soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="95">This way, he was commuting, with a piece of paper, in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">It took, those were, quote, the commandos that were working outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">It was, for us, very nice because my father was able to bring a little bit of food from <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, which was very, very nice, which we didn't have before.</sentence><sentence id="98">I need simply very quickly to tell you that my older sister Saba (ph) had a fiance who was a Polish officer.</sentence><sentence id="99">And he run away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, as a Polish officer, not only as a Jew, but as a Polish officer, and she went with him.</sentence><sentence id="100">They went east at the beginning of the war.</sentence><sentence id="101">And this is how she was saved.</sentence><sentence id="102">So we were left, my father, my mother, my sister Esther and I.So going back to the story, Esther at that time joined the <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> and she was working in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">So here we have my father, who is working outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">My mother was keeping <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">I belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shomeratzayir</span> (ph), which is a youth organization, depending on who you speak with.</sentence><sentence id="106">It's rather to the left, but it is not like some people say Communist now.</sentence><sentence id="107">It was very socialist.</sentence><sentence id="108">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we were having our Hebrew names, we were singing Hebrew songs, we were dreaming of Zionism and free <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and emigrating to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and, of course, as you know, we were part of the Warsaw uprising.</sentence><sentence id="109">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, you have a <span class="DLF">generation gap</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">The older people, who had families, were very much preoccupied with the safety of those dependent on them.</sentence><sentence id="111">As young people, we had nothing to worry about except our lives and, you know, when you are young, your life doesn't mean very much.</sentence><sentence id="112">I will never forget, at the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, in about "40, "41, two young men came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, two Jewish men.</sentence><sentence id="113">It was the first time that all the different youth organizations, Jewish youth</sentence><sentence id="115">organizations, got together under the same <span class="DLF">roof</span> in spite of the political differences of the spectrum, right to left, or those what have you.</sentence><sentence id="116">We gathered together in the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on Tomaska (ph) Street.</sentence><sentence id="117">It was one of the largest <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">And these two young men told us about the atrocities perpetrated on youth in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> in east of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, about the murders.</sentence><sentence id="119">I believed that this is when the seeds for the uprising started, right at that particular point.</sentence><sentence id="120">When we got up to sing that Hazakna (ph), that Hebrew Shomeratzayir hymn that we will be strong.</sentence><sentence id="121">And all of us stood up to sing it, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> trembled, there was that strength.</sentence><sentence id="122">But when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told my father, "that I don't want to hear this propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="123">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> are going for work.</sentence><sentence id="124">I don't want to hear those kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="125">Don't worry your mother."</sentence><sentence id="126">So then we have the generation gap from the older generation to the younger generation.</sentence><sentence id="127">To go back to the story, though, my father was working on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, coming back every day.</sentence><sentence id="128">And I was spending my days with Shomeratzayir.</sentence><sentence id="129">One of my functions was to teach Polish to the many Jewish children who did not have Polish education.</sentence><sentence id="130">They were versed in Yiddish, but not in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="131">So this was my job, to help them, you know, improve their spelling and reading skills, one of my jobs.</sentence><sentence id="132">Another of the jobs was to put the posters on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> at night to raise the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to arms, that type of thing.</sentence><sentence id="133">Q. How dangerous was that?A. It was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="134">First of all, there was a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="135">You know, we couldn't do it before the curfew.</sentence><sentence id="136">And if anybody was caught after the curfew, they were shot on the spot, no questions asked.</sentence><sentence id="137">And my father was very unhappy when I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after curfew.</sentence><sentence id="138">It was at night, the two -- we were going in pairs, you know, one with a, with a, big wet brush, you</sentence><sentence id="140">know, put the glue on, and the other putting the poster, and running, you know, from <span class="DLF">wall</span> to <span class="DLF">wall</span> to wall to <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">This was very, very dangerous, no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="142">For us it was a lark.</sentence><sentence id="143">But it was not.</sentence><sentence id="144">By the way, at that point, I must have been 13.</sentence><sentence id="145">This was about that frame.</sentence><sentence id="146">I was born in "28.</sentence><sentence id="147">I was 11 when the war broke out in "39, about 13 in "41,"42.</sentence><sentence id="148">Anyway, one day we got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Umschlagplatz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149"><span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> is the place where the Jews were gathered, waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> to take them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">That my father was caught.</sentence><sentence id="151">As he was coming back from work, paper or no paper, he was taken, and the whole commando was taken immediately to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">My father's boss was a German Wehrmacht captain, Hauptmann (ph) in German, I believe it is a captain in English.</sentence><sentence id="153">We gave him a call and we told him, look, my father was called to <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">I wish I could remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="155">I don't.</sentence><sentence id="156">He took his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and came to <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> and told the young SS man: "Look, this man is working for me, I want him out now."</sentence><sentence id="157">And this young officer told him: "Look, I am not taking orders from you."</sentence><sentence id="158">He said: "I am a captain and you are a private."</sentence><sentence id="159">He said: "I don't care, my orders have to be in writing from the <span class="INT_SPACE">SS quarters</span>."</sentence><sentence id="160">So the Hauptmann said: "Look" -- to us -- "tomorrow morning, first thing in the morning, I'm going to be back here with the proper paper.</sentence><sentence id="161">I will take your father out."</sentence><sentence id="162">What he didn't know that tomorrow would be too late because at that time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going every night.</sentence><sentence id="163">Lo and behold, my father escaped from <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span>, I don't know how.</sentence><sentence id="164">The following day, he goes back to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">And he tells the Hauptmann: "Look, I have a wife and two daughters.</sentence><sentence id="166">You are here a group of soldiers, you are here in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, surely they need some services performed on them, cleaning, laundry, cooking, whatever, why don't you take my wife and two daughters and they will help you here and we will all be here together." "</sentence><sentence id="167">Sure."</sentence><sentence id="168">Hauptmann says "That is no problem.</sentence><sentence id="169">But you have to arrange your papers through the arbeitsdienst," which was the ghetto Jewish equivalent of work exchange, you know, they were in charge of organizing the</sentence><sentence id="171">proper papers and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="172">So when my father went there, they thought my goodness, if this Hauptmann can save a family of four, surely he can accommodate more of us.</sentence><sentence id="173">They got in touch with him.</sentence><sentence id="174">And sure enough, he took 30 people and located them in this <span class="BUILDING">German barracks</span> which were located in what used to be a <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">The <span class="BUILDING">Polish public schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> were all the same, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were built by the same -- in the same type of architecture.</sentence><sentence id="176">So the soldiers were in the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and they gave us the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> in the -- not the cellular, but just the ... mezzanine, kind of.</sentence><sentence id="177">It was called partair (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">It was just before -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>, okay, this is where we were, 30 people.</sentence><sentence id="179">We were all there working as Jews on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">All, that is, except my sister Esther, for whom there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">So she stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">Because she stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I got a pass to commute between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span>, and I was going once a week.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shomeratzayir</span>, so I was able to come to bring some food for them, not much, whatever, share between my sister and between them, and I was still active in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shomeratzayir</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">Until one day, it was one of the most painful experiences for me, it seems so insignificant now but I still think about it, I was told by the Shomeratzayir people that because of security reasons, they can't afford guests, I have to make up my mind, either I am with them or I am not.</sentence><sentence id="185">So I had to decide to stay with Shomeratzayir and to leave my deaf parents alone.</sentence><sentence id="186">I couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="187">So I elected, of course, to go back to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="188">It was too late anyway.</sentence><sentence id="189">At that particular time, the hell broke loose.</sentence><sentence id="190">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> uprising was in full swing.</sentence><sentence id="191">My sister was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I was in this little post.</sentence><sentence id="192">There were maybe four of us.</sentence><sentence id="193">There was one rifle.</sentence><sentence id="194">And my superior in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shomeratzayir</span>, his name Shimmon Heller (ph), was with us.</sentence><sentence id="195">There were sniper shots all over.</sentence><sentence id="196">We didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">Our communicators were runners, young boys mostly, who were running from post to post to keep contact.</sentence><sentence id="198">One of the runners was running and Shimmon saw him down the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">He was shot and he was wounded.</sentence><sentence id="200">So Shimmon run to bring him back and he was</sentence><sentence id="202">killed right then and there.</sentence><sentence id="203">Another runner came through and said listen, guys, everything is over, each one for himself, finished.</sentence><sentence id="204">I want you to know that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shomeratzayir</span> we got orders not to be caught alive, that no matter what happens, we are not going to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> alive.</sentence><sentence id="205">Those were the orders.</sentence><sentence id="206">This was the spirit of the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="207">So this runner said to me: "Look, we're going to run and we are going to run out."</sentence><sentence id="208">I said: "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="209">Come with me, my sister is across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="210">So we run to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> of this restored <span class="BUILDING">building</span> -- at that point, the Germans were methodically blowing up and putting fires to every single <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">In our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> two away from us was burning.</sentence><sentence id="213">Our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was so hot, it was so smoky that we couldn't possibly stay there.</sentence><sentence id="214">The <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> were built in such a way that you had front of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> and each <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had a square <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> that you reach through the <span class="DLF">gate</span>

uniforms to wear for a while.</sentence><sentence id="338">We were in what was called the <span class="DLF">quarantine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">It was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">It was a square, small square of sand, where people sat and waited, I don't know for what.</sentence><sentence id="341">There were Greek girls who couldn't take the climate, they suffered from malaria.</sentence><sentence id="342">And everybody was</sentence><sentence id="344">2 sitting there, looking for each other for lice, looking through the cloth, cleaning each other.</sentence><sentence id="345">There was no human reaction there, we were just sitting, cleaning themselves, without any strength to move, no reason to get up, unless chased, just sitting, just waiting, just dying.</sentence><sentence id="346">We were still fresh, we're okay.</sentence><sentence id="347">Across from us at that time was the men's lager.</sentence><sentence id="348">And we could see one day there was a selection of the men, which means that the men stood in rows naked and were filed before the Germans to be moved, to be destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="349">At that point, I was 14.</sentence><sentence id="350">For the first time in my life that I saw a naked man.</sentence><sentence id="351">It was indecent, but the implication of what the selection was all about didn't hit me at that time, you know, younger men, older men, different type of work.</sentence><sentence id="352">We were told that the men lager is going to be moved and that we, from the Birkenau Lager A, are going to move to Birkenau Lager B, where the men used to be.</sentence><sentence id="353">Sure enough, somebody whispered to us: Say that you are metallurgist, say that you are metallurgist.</sentence><sentence id="354">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="355">Here comes the arbeitsdienst, this is an SS woman, asking us professions, what are we, say metallurgist, say metallurgist, that's fine.</sentence><sentence id="356">We go, we go into the <span class="BUILDING">salman</span> (ph), which was a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span>, a communal shower room.</sentence><sentence id="357">There had to be at least 50 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shower heads</span>, you know, 50 different women taking <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> altogether.</sentence><sentence id="358">And different shapes and sizes, different stages of composition, decomposition, you know.</sentence><sentence id="359">Some young and beautiful and some, you know, it was again this kind of an intimacy that we weren't used to.</sentence><sentence id="360">But, the water was warm for the first time, I understand, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">Until that time, there was only cold water.</sentence><sentence id="362">And we got decent clothes.</sentence><sentence id="363">By decent clothes, I mean the striped uniforms, which were made out of recycled paper fibers, you know, they were very sharp and scratchy, and you had to be awfully careful.</sentence><sentence id="364">Because we were emaciated, and if you got a scabies or any kind of a scratch on your body, it was dangerous for you.</sentence><sentence id="365">But anyway, they would go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and we go, we are placed in a <span class="DLF">block</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">And we are placed in what was called the union commando, which we understood was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that</sentence><sentence id="368">3 produced <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="369">Eventually, we found that this was <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">Anyway, in Lager B, we got to meet friends.</sentence><sentence id="371">There was a group of us, I wish I remembered their names, but I don't.</sentence><sentence id="372">But I believe that Hetta Folkes (ph) is one of them.</sentence><sentence id="373">Hetta Folkes is in this little booklet that we had compiled for the ceremony of unveiling of the monument for the four girls.</sentence><sentence id="374">So that the eyewitness reports from union, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, Hetta Folkes is one of them.</sentence><sentence id="375">And we used to meet in the evenings, and the same thing that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> happened here.</sentence><sentence id="376">We were spiritually transported from the reality of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> into the dreaming of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, of freedom, of getting out, exchanging stories.</sentence><sentence id="377">So that the reality of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> really didn't touch us, and our dream quality touched us more.</sentence><sentence id="378">And there was no peril, because we were living for the evenings, we would get together, when all this will become unreality, when our reality will become the reality.</sentence><sentence id="379">It was just wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="380">I think that Victor Frankl, in his book, says, you know, in search of the meaning, if you have the meaning, no matter where you are, you transcend yourself over the situation.</sentence><sentence id="381">Sometimes in real life we call it schizophrenia.</sentence><sentence id="382">There, it was our salvation.</sentence><sentence id="383">When the reality becomes too painful, obviously it may have different ways of expressing itself.</sentence><sentence id="384">We have the support of each other, the reality didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="385">In this particular club, it was mostly Jewish, but we had one Yugoslavian girl, again whose name I don't remember, who was not Jewish, who was part of this group.</sentence><sentence id="386">She apparently had contact with the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">And she was our newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="388">She was our journalist.</sentence><sentence id="389">She was bringing us rumors and things from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> as she knew them.</sentence><sentence id="390">And we are talking each one about our experiences and telling stories.</sentence><sentence id="391">And they didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="392">And we told them, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> rose, they come, we fought.</sentence><sentence id="393">And they laughed.</sentence><sentence id="394">They said that there were smarter people than you here and nobody did anything.</sentence><sentence id="395">And we said well, we are not going to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> alive.</sentence><sentence id="396">If somebody will drag us, then we take somebody with us or they will have to kill us, we</sentence><sentence id="398">4 are not going.</sentence><sentence id="399">And it caught fire.</sentence><sentence id="400">They can't bodily drag us every single one, we're not going.</sentence><sentence id="401">It gave us courage.</sentence><sentence id="402">In those evenings, somebody said, you know, the rumors are coming, the Russians are coming, the Russians are coming near.</sentence><sentence id="403">The PPR, which is the Polish workers party, the underground Polish worker party, is planning to storm <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> when the Russians will be here.</sentence><sentence id="404">And there is underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who is going to raise from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> so that we will revolt when the Russians come.</sentence><sentence id="405">Fine.</sentence><sentence id="406">This was in 1944.</sentence><sentence id="407">In the summer 1944, I believe, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Hungarian transport</span> came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">From where we were, we saw thousands and thousands of people marching just across the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>, the electrical wire.</sentence><sentence id="409">There were four <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">They were burning day and night, smoke and fire belching out.</sentence><sentence id="411">But our soup in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was better.</sentence><sentence id="412">Because whatever food was gathered from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was thrown into the soup, so we had pieces of biscuits that we hadn't before.</sentence><sentence id="413">By periodical selections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, whenever there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, they used to weed out the camp population, those that could no longer work separated from those that could.</sentence><sentence id="414">We were lined -- no.</sentence><sentence id="415">We were on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, tetrush (ph) prisoners of the administration created a <span class="DLF">cordon</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">We had orders to undress completely and go over in front of the selecting officers.</sentence><sentence id="417">And told to go left or right; left to life, right to death.</sentence><sentence id="418">And the one selection day, I was rotten from the waist down, infection, boils.</sentence><sentence id="419">The combination of poor diet, poor hygiene, what have you, just developed in boils.</sentence><sentence id="420">I wasn't going to undress.</sentence><sentence id="421">IfI do, it's a death warrant.</sentence><sentence id="422">I decided I'm going to undress on top but not at the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="423">I tried to go once and was pushed back, undress.</sentence><sentence id="426">5 I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="427">I went again, I was certain I was going to death, I was passed to right.</sentence><sentence id="428">This was it, we passed the selection.</sentence><sentence id="429">And this was at the same time because whatever manpower that was depleted by selection was replaced by the new people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">It was a supply and demand situation.</sentence><sentence id="431">At the time, when we heard about the preparation for the revolt, we were thinking what can we do, what are we going to do.</sentence><sentence id="432">We secured the keys to the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where the agricultural supplies were kept, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hoes</span>, rakes, things like this.</sentence><sentence id="433">We remember from history lessons that in 1862, in the resurrection in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the farmers fought armed with the rakes and hoes, they made a difference.</sentence><sentence id="434">And we were going to make the difference too, we had the keys, we were prepared.</sentence><sentence id="435">And then, as we were working in the union, and my sister was working in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was called <span class="INT_SPACE">pulver room</span>, where the gunpowder was kept.</sentence><sentence id="436">Okay, we have gunpowder, we can use it.</sentence><sentence id="437">My sister was appalled.</sentence><sentence id="438">She said nothing doing, it's sheer madness.</sentence><sentence id="439">Hey, let's try it.</sentence><sentence id="440">What could happen?</sentence><sentence id="441">We're not going to come out alive anyway, what the heck, right?</sentence><sentence id="442">I have here the map of the interior of the union.</sentence><sentence id="443">We decided we are going to try it out.</sentence><sentence id="444">Where we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, there were little metal boxes to keep not the garbage but the debris, you know, from work, you know, that something that was spoiled, a piece of material, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="445">So you kept in your metal box that was about, oh, I would say, what, about six inches high, 12 inches long, six inches wide, just about, and we used to put them in the boxes and periodically throw them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage bins</span> that were situated at the corners of the big <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="446">So, you know, we are going to try something out.</sentence><sentence id="447">I said take one box, go around from my <span class="NPIP">place</span> to where she worked, give her an empty box and she would give me a box with garbage, take the box, throw the contents into the bin, come back into my <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">Within several times, nothing happened, nobody paid any attention.</sentence><sentence id="449">See, we can do it.</sentence><sentence id="450">We can do it.</sentence><sentence id="451">We perfected it.</sentence><sentence id="452">Stacking those two boxes, one on top of the other.</sentence><sentence id="453">She will take the gunpowder from the <span class="INT_SPACE">pulver room</span>, put in little pieces of material with a little string, throw it in the garbage.</sentence><sentence id="454">I would come in,</sentence><sentence id="456">6 take this box, with another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage box</span> on top, go into my <span class="NPIP">place</span>, take the powder out, stuff it in my dress.</sentence><sentence id="457">And our guard, we had a system of communication, you needed permission to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="458">But when you say I am going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, you make sure you come there at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="459">And we used to divide this in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and take it with us and pray.</sentence><sentence id="460">It was three and a half kilometers between union -- within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, and <span class="BUILDING">union factory</span> was just next door to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">We used to carry it and sometimes we used to have searches.</sentence><sentence id="462">So when they were looking for contraband, if anybody had parcels, food parcels, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="463">We always made sure that we were not in the first five rows.</sentence><sentence id="464">There were, I believe, 1,000 of us in the rows of five, okay.</sentence><sentence id="465">I can't figure it out how many <span class="DLF">rows</span> there were.</sentence><sentence id="466">But we always tried to make a row of five, the same five, and make sure we are in the middle, not the beginning, not the end, so that if something happens, we will know ahead of time.</sentence><sentence id="467">We used to take this gunpowder, take the cord off behind our backs, throw it on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and rub it with our feet.</sentence><sentence id="468">It would rub in with the dirt because the gun powder are granules, grayish, and they blended in.</sentence><sentence id="469">And we were never caught.</sentence><sentence id="470">Ifit was dangerous, it was.</sentence><sentence id="471">You can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="472">Nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="473">Q. Let's stop.</sentence><sentence id="474">A. Good.</sentence><sentence id="476">Tape 2 Q. Why don't you -- let's just describe a typical day of work.</sentence><sentence id="477">Once you were assigned to anything, tell me what time you got up and then what happened, and tell me about a day of work.</sentence><sentence id="480">7 A. We used to -- we were very privileged working in the union.</sentence><sentence id="481">It was considered a very good commando in terms of relative good or bad in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> situation.</sentence><sentence id="482">It was good because working in the union, we were no longer subject to selections.</sentence><sentence id="483">This in itself was very important.</sentence><sentence id="484">We were woken in the middle of the night, when it was still dark.</sentence><sentence id="485">I couldn't tell you the hour, 4:00, 5:00.</sentence><sentence id="486">We all had to look good.</sentence><sentence id="487">We knew that we had to look good, so we used to have our dresses folded properly under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> so that when we get up in the morning, they were nice and didn't look crumpled.</sentence><sentence id="488">We had wooden shoes that had to be spic and span.</sentence><sentence id="489">During the morning, we used to get what we call -- what was called chi (ph), which is a kind of a herbal tea that they used to make from the weeds that were growing around there.</sentence><sentence id="490">It was warm.</sentence><sentence id="491">It wasn't drinkable, but we drank it.</sentence><sentence id="492">But most of all, we used to wash ourselves with it, and polish our shoes.</sentence><sentence id="493">It was impossible to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">communal washroom</span> at that time because people were fighting at the <span class="DLF">door</span> to get in.</sentence><sentence id="494">And every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> had a responsible person, which was called the kapo.</sentence><sentence id="495">A kapo was responsible.</sentence><sentence id="496">So you had a <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> kapo, you had a commando kapo, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="497">If you were good friends with her or something, she would let you in first.</sentence><sentence id="498">If not, she will just beat you up to go back in the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="499">So we simply didn't even bother.</sentence><sentence id="500">We used the chi, this tea, to get washed with and to drink with.</sentence><sentence id="501">Then, we were to stand up in the <span class="DLF">lines</span> of five <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for a roll call.</sentence><sentence id="502">It was called appell.</sentence><sentence id="503">It was terrible because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> is built on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and, for some reason, it's always very, very windy.</sentence><sentence id="504">And you didn't want to be exposed to the wind and the cold, because your feet and your hands, your extremity in particular, used to freeze just from standing and just from the cold.</sentence><sentence id="505">We had to stand there for hours.</sentence><sentence id="506">While before the SS people came to count us, we could still huddle each other, you know, and cover each other and warm each other up.</sentence><sentence id="507">But when they used to come, then we had to stand straight.</sentence><sentence id="508">And then we were checked for proper attire and the clean shoes and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="509">So you went through different checks.</sentence><sentence id="510">The blockaltester, which was responsible for our <span class="DLF">block</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span></sentence><sentence id="512">8 where we lived, was the first one to make sure that she won't be punished because one of us was not -- it was like a military kind of an operation, you know.</sentence><sentence id="513">And then the SS woman that was counting us was -- would look at us, going through the rows and look.</sentence><sentence id="514">We used to stand there for hours and hours and hours.</sentence><sentence id="515">We used to take our wooden shoes off because they would scrape our feet.</sentence><sentence id="516">And if it scraped your feet, you would get a blister.</sentence><sentence id="517">And when you got a blister, you were subject for selection.</sentence><sentence id="518">You know, it was -- you really had to take good care of yourself.</sentence><sentence id="519">I remember at one point we threw out our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span>, and we used to sleep on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> were full of lice and lice had disease, and so -- anyway, so we used to be there on the roll call.</sentence><sentence id="520">After the roll call, we used -- I believe that we had -- each commando had a different color of kerchief.</sentence><sentence id="521">We all had kerchiefs.</sentence><sentence id="522">I believe that ours were white, but I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="523">So we looked, quote, smart, you know, always the same kind of dresses, with the wooden shoes, with the white kerchief, that we were marching left and right and left and right.</sentence><sentence id="524">And as you know, we had an orchestra.</sentence><sentence id="525">And the orchestra was playing near the <span class="DLF">gate</span> where we were walking out.</sentence><sentence id="526">The SS men watching us with dogs.</sentence><sentence id="527">But those dogs were quiet for the union commando, you know, it was okay.</sentence><sentence id="528">And then we walked the three and a half kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to union, which was short distance from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="529">But there's three and a half kilometers between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, so I estimate, you know, maybe the most three and a half, four kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="530">It is not very long, but when you are tired and when you already stood for a few hours <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and you are cold, you had to really start working your feet and your legs to march from the -- they were falling asleep and they were cold, before you started to walk.</sentence><sentence id="531">It was a long walk for us then.</sentence><sentence id="532">Then we used to go five by five, each one, to her particular <span class="NPIP">spot</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="533">There was a large <span class="DLF">corridor</span> as you walked in, very large.</sentence><sentence id="534">I would say that it would take about -- we were in the rows of five, it would easily take another row of five, you know, we took half the width of the</sentence><sentence id="536">9 <span class="DLF">corridor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="537">We used to go, and on our right there was -- I forget the term, but this is when they had the <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> of the tools, so we used to pass that.</sentence><sentence id="538">It was separated from the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> with <span class="DLF">chicken wire fence</span>, kind of.</sentence><sentence id="539">On the right-hand side, you had the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, you had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>, you had the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, you had the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">And my particular post was just on the left, just across from the big, big, presses.</sentence><sentence id="541">They were gigantic, huge, what were called Kuntztof (ph) presses that manufactured the parts that went into the final product.</sentence><sentence id="542">I still don't know exactly what it is that they manufactured, something, you know, in terms of armament, but I don't know exactly what.</sentence><sentence id="543">So the presses were, as you walked on the left-hand side, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were on the right-hand side.</sentence><sentence id="544">Behind our bags was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glass partition</span> from the second department.</sentence><sentence id="545">And I remember when I first came in, I thought, you know, they are so inefficient.</sentence><sentence id="546">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> between this <span class="DLF">glass wall</span> and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stools</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>.</sentence><sentence id="547">I said well, why didn't they put it all the way back?</sentence><sentence id="548">And then I realized that they didn't so that they would have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to go behind our backs and check what we are doing.</sentence><sentence id="549">I was working in some kind of a control.</sentence><sentence id="550">We had little pieces that looked like checkers.</sentence><sentence id="551">They were called einsatz schtuker (ph), whatever that means.</sentence><sentence id="552">And we were sitting in a row, there were about eight girls at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, each one had in front of her a precision instrument that was checking for the perfection of this checkered piece.</sentence><sentence id="553">It had many indentations, and each instrument was geared to check a particular indentation, so to work past from hand to hand to hand.</sentence><sentence id="554">And whatever wasn't good, we used to throw into this -- these boxes, you know, it was the awful garbage, or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="555">We had a kapo.</sentence><sentence id="556">A kapo is responsible, it is an overseer.</sentence><sentence id="557">She was a German prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="558">Her name was Alma (ph).</sentence><sentence id="559">She was a very funny kind of a character.</sentence><sentence id="560">She could be very nice and she could be very sadistic.</sentence><sentence id="561">She was rather obese.</sentence><sentence id="562">And she was short of breath.</sentence><sentence id="563">And she had a particular mannerism of going, with the corner of mouth (indicating).Everybody, you know, mimicked her.</sentence><sentence id="564">She was easy to mimic as a caricature of the person.</sentence><sentence id="565">She</sentence><sentence id="567">0 used to check our belongings and what have you, whether we had an extra piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="568">She liked to have bribes.</sentence><sentence id="569">I wasn't a particularly good customer, I didn't have anything to give her, so.</sentence><sentence id="570">But she had a boyfriend, and this was very, very important because when she and her boyfriend were busy talking, I was free to get up and walk and she wouldn't pay attention to me, so I blessed this boyfriend every day of my life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="571">We were working there from, I don't know, I would imagine from about 7:00 o'clock in the morning till lunchtime.</sentence><sentence id="572">At lunchtime, we had a lunch break where we were given lunch.</sentence><sentence id="573">And this was also a blessing in disguise.</sentence><sentence id="574">You need to know the reality of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> life.</sentence><sentence id="575">It has many parallels to any life anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="576">For example, we used to get our lunch in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drum kettles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">Now, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, those that were responsible of ladling out the soup that we used to get at lunchtime, could, or could not, mix the soup.</sentence><sentence id="578">Now, if they choose not to, we would get the water, and what was left at the bottom was for them.</sentence><sentence id="579">It made a great deal of difference, what they got, what we got.</sentence><sentence id="580">In the morning, we used to get with our chi -- we were supposed to get a quarter of a loaf of bread, which was very heavy and very small.</sentence><sentence id="581">But those that were in charge of the bread were ingenious.</sentence><sentence id="582">What they used to do, they used to take a bread, cut it on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, so there was a slice in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="583">They used to take this slice, put what was left over together.</sentence><sentence id="584">And what was left over, cut into four.</sentence><sentence id="585">So that our fourth was actually smaller than what we were entitled to.</sentence><sentence id="586">And the spare pieces of bread went to those who could.</sentence><sentence id="587">So this was in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="588">At lunchtime, when we were in the union, those soup were mixed very well.</sentence><sentence id="589">So our soup was very good.</sentence><sentence id="590">We each had a tin red <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">enamel bowel</span> and a spoon.</sentence><sentence id="591">Heaven help us if we didn't have it.</sentence><sentence id="592">Because if we didn't have it, we wouldn't get our soup.</sentence><sentence id="593">So this was the most important item of belongings that we had.</sentence><sentence id="594">So this was at the lunchtime, the soup, and the soup was good.</sentence><sentence id="595">After lunchtime, back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> until about 5:00 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="596">At 5:00 o'clock, we would <span class="DLF">line</span> in the fifth and go back.</sentence><sentence id="597">It was uneventful.</sentence><sentence id="598">Mind you, when we first</sentence><sentence id="600">1 came in -- my job was easy.</sentence><sentence id="601">Not every department had such an easy job.</sentence><sentence id="602">The disturbing thing in my department was that when the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">presses</span> were working, they spewed a yellow powder from their manufacturing and printing of the material that was being pressed in and out, so the <span class="DLF">air</span> there was full of this yellow dust.</sentence><sentence id="603">The presses make terrible noise, a humming kind of noise, up and down and up and down, and they were tremendously heavy.</sentence><sentence id="604">That was -- that was a man's job.</sentence><sentence id="605">And I remember one day there was one German woman that was operating one of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">presses</span> and I went over, I tried to lift it.</sentence><sentence id="606">It was not possible.</sentence><sentence id="607">So not all the jobs were as physically easy as mine that I did.</sentence><sentence id="608">So this was my kind of job.</sentence><sentence id="609">Then at night we used to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="610">Q. Was there an appell at night too?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="611">Q. But not -- A. Yes, another appell at night, but not quite as long as it was in the morning, unless there was an escape.</sentence><sentence id="612">If there was an escape, mostly from the men's lager, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span>, there was silence and we would stand there and stand there until released, not necessarily when they found the people or brought them back, mostly they did.</sentence><sentence id="613">But, you know, when there was an escape, then we would stand for hours.</sentence><sentence id="614">But if I remember, the coming back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was less long for some reason than in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="615">In the morning, I don't know why, but they were much longer.</sentence><sentence id="616">I think maybe it's our blockaltester responsible for the <span class="DLF">block</span> needed us to get out of the <span class="DLF">block</span> so that they could clean the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and have them ready for inspection when the SS people came</sentence><sentence id="618">2 to count us over and over again, to make absolutely sure, you know, that everything was okay.</sentence><sentence id="619">Because if not, they were responsible.</sentence><sentence id="620">Maybe that was the reason.</sentence><sentence id="621">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="622">But somehow, in my memory, the going back was shorter.</sentence><sentence id="623">And we were so anxious, you know, to get together and share the news with other people.</sentence><sentence id="624">Remember the group I was telling you about, just so anxious to be with them.</sentence><sentence id="625">Q. Now, how long before your group got together and started deciding that you were going to try to do something, whatever it was, how long were you going to work before you -- how long were you -- how long was it that you were going to work and then you figured out maybe we could smuggle gunpowder?A. I couldn't tell you.</sentence><sentence id="626">I don't remember how long.</sentence><sentence id="627">I remember that we were meeting for quite a while.</sentence><sentence id="628">And I remember -- how long could it be?</sentence><sentence id="629">We were meeting for quite a while and were quite a well-knit group.</sentence><sentence id="630">And I don't remember at particularly what point we got the news that the Russians are coming.</sentence><sentence id="631">You know, this is where this rumor started, that the Russians are coming.</sentence><sentence id="632">And remember the -- I know now what I didn't know then, that the Russians stopped at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, what was it, for some period of time.</sentence><sentence id="633">We didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="634">We were waiting for them every day to come.</sentence><sentence id="635">But they didn't, they stopped.</sentence><sentence id="636">And the partisans from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> never came.</sentence><sentence id="637">And the war from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> never happened.</sentence><sentence id="638">But we were preparing for that.</sentence><sentence id="639">Q. In many ways, not just with gunpowder, but also the keys to the <span class="BUILDING">agricultural shed</span>, tell me more about the keys.</sentence><sentence id="640">And also, I read at some point that you got some shears or you asked for</sentence><sentence id="642">3 some shears or something.</sentence><sentence id="643">Tell me all the little things that were -- it sounds to me like your group was coming up with any -- just gathering all sorts of ways that could be used later.</sentence><sentence id="644">A. That's correct.</sentence><sentence id="645">The keys for the <span class="BUILDING">agricultural shed</span> was another member of our group who worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="646">She got it somehow.</sentence><sentence id="647">I got the insulated shears.</sentence><sentence id="648">And this was sheer madness.</sentence><sentence id="649">As I told you, when we were walking in, there was this big <span class="DLF">corridor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">And on the left-hand side, there was the <span class="BUILDING">tools dispensary</span>, or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="651">Every time I was walking by there, there was a Yugoslavian man, not a Jew, that always smiled at me, and I smiled in return.</sentence><sentence id="652">I don't even know his name.</sentence><sentence id="653">I have no idea who he was.</sentence><sentence id="654">When we were thinking, you know, of the revolt, I thought to myself look, we need insulated wires to cut through the electrified wires, we need it, where are we going to get it?</sentence><sentence id="655">And he was working at the tools.</sentence><sentence id="656">So one day, I said to him hey, listen, I need the insulated wire cutters.</sentence><sentence id="657">He just looked at me.</sentence><sentence id="658">And this was it, this was all that was said, nothing more.</sentence><sentence id="659">I thought what can happen?</sentence><sentence id="660">One day, he walked -- you know, this was the standard procedure, you know, walking with those boxes, it was the camouflage for being busy and doing something very official.</sentence><sentence id="661">You know, you just don't walk, nobody walks, you know, you walk with a purpose, you walk for areason.</sentence><sentence id="662">You know, one reason can be to take this box and then throw it into the garbage, right?</sentence><sentence id="663">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="664">Lo and behold, one day he came into our department and he put two boxes in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="665">Alma was busy with the boyfriend, good.</sentence><sentence id="666">And I just looked at him, took the two boxes, put it under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="667">Goodbye, goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="668">When I opened the box, underneath, there were bread.</sentence><sentence id="669">I thought well, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="670">This was the only present I ever got in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from somebody was this whole bread.</sentence><sentence id="671">I said my goodness, that's great.</sentence><sentence id="672">We took the bread.</sentence><sentence id="673">We are working.</sentence><sentence id="674">I told Estucia (ph), hey, guess what, I have bread, whole bread.</sentence><sentence id="675">I have to tell you, you know, something aside from the -- of the human beings, you know, women or men, women in</sentence><sentence id="677">4 particular, we each one had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> what we used to call a boytl (ph).</sentence><sentence id="678">A boytl is a sack.</sentence><sentence id="679">This is German for a sack.</sentence><sentence id="680">It was made from scraps of material, where we kept our possessions, whatever, a piece of string, a toothbrush, if you bought one, your spoon, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="681">There were searches.</sentence><sentence id="682">And every time there was a search, we lost our boytls and in no time at all, you had another boytl again.</sentence><sentence id="683">You know, the human characteristic of gathering things and having some possessions, no matter what, we all had a bag with possessions.</sentence><sentence id="684">Stupid little things, but they meant everything.</sentence><sentence id="685">We always had them.</sentence><sentence id="686">Because we had them, of course the bread went right into it.</sentence><sentence id="687">We come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we open this bread, and what do you know, there were the insulated shears there.</sentence><sentence id="688">I trusted him, and he trusted me.</sentence><sentence id="689">And I didn't know who he is.</sentence><sentence id="690">We had it.</sentence><sentence id="691">Gave it to either Marta or somebody, you know, for hiding, but we had it, giving us a sense of security.</sentence><sentence id="692">If nothing else, we had a way out.</sentence><sentence id="693">Q. What other things like that can you remember?A. This was about the kind of thing that I remember, other than the spiritual and moral readiness.</sentence><sentence id="694">You know, this is -- I believe it's a mind-set.</sentence><sentence id="695">You just tell yourself that you're going to die with dignity or that you are going to survive at any cost.</sentence><sentence id="696">We kind of knew that we are not going to survive; therefore, we are going to make our deaths count.</sentence><sentence id="697">This was it.</sentence><sentence id="698">We were ready.</sentence><sentence id="699">We were wrong.</sentence><sentence id="700">We did survive.</sentence><sentence id="701">We didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="702">You never know in life when you were going to be dead, so might as well do something, make not our life count but our death count.</sentence><sentence id="705">5 Q. Tell me more about when you approached your sister about getting gunpowder, and she -- it sounds like she was reluctant.</sentence><sentence id="706">A. She didn't want to.</sentence><sentence id="707">Q. Tell me more about that whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="708">Tell me about convincing her.</sentence><sentence id="709">A. It wasn't -- you know, the one day, came from this group, I said look, we have access to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">She said you are crazy.</sentence><sentence id="711">Not going to survive, how can we do it?</sentence><sentence id="712">This is the type of thing, you know, that over a period of time, as I told you, making this dry runs with the boxes, it worked and it progressed.</sentence><sentence id="713">The tragedy is that she died, that I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="714">It didn't take very much.</sentence><sentence id="715">It was the reality of the danger, of course.</sentence><sentence id="716">She was a few years older, more responsible.</sentence><sentence id="717">I can't tell you much more than that.</sentence><sentence id="718">The point is that she agreed.</sentence><sentence id="719">The point is that she didn't agree because I pressured her, she agreed because she believed in that.</sentence><sentence id="720">It was a -- you know, you have somebody close to you, you discuss things, you get together on that.</sentence><sentence id="721">Q. Now, again describe to me how it worked with the metal boxes and how -- how your sister and the others in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gunpowder room</span> managed to steal some of the gunpowder.</sentence><sentence id="722">A. I cannot tell you about the other girls.</sentence><sentence id="723">I can only tell you about my sister.</sentence><sentence id="724">My sister was the first through the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="725">If you look at the schedule -- at the plan of the union factory floor map, you will see that the <span class="INT_SPACE">pulver room</span>, where the girls worked, was at the outer north side of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="726">The <span class="DLF">door</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">pulver room</span> was on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="727">She would prepare the little packages of gunpowder in the amount of a Ping-Pong ball, small, in pieces of material with the string that she would put in one box, put the garbage on top of it, put another box on top of it.</sentence><sentence id="730">6 would come in with two empty boxes.</sentence><sentence id="731">She would give me two boxes with garbage.</sentence><sentence id="732">I would take these boxes, walk around, come back into my place of work, put the boxes under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, fish out the little gunpowder, put it inside my dress, call Alma to tell her I want to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">When Alma knew I am going to go there, I would make how many trips like this, maybe two a day, or maybe one, you know, and this went through the period of a few months, not too long, really, you know, it was until we were moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">This was as long as we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">And in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, Alla (ph) and I would give her mine and then I would have another one.</sentence><sentence id="736">I would carry it <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">Does this answer your question?</sentence><sentence id="738">Can you visualize it?Q. When you -- did you ever have to sacrifice the gunpowder you were carrying because you were going to be searched?</sentence><sentence id="739">A. Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="740">On several occasions, it happened that we had to -- we knew that there were searches, you know, it's passed almost like a wave, you hear from the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span> of the commando through the end, search, search, search, so we knew in enough time to just take it out, open it behind us, spread it on the -- throw it on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and rub it with our feet so it would blend in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="741">It happened on several occasions.</sentence><sentence id="742">Q.

Lalways thought it was six.</sentence><sentence id="1177">I think that Rose Meth, who was born Rose Greenapple, worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gunpowder room</span> together with Estucia, she should know better.</sentence><sentence id="1178">It was six, seven, eight the most.</sentence><sentence id="1179">Q. Small number?A. Small number.</sentence><sentence id="1180">I know that they worked on day shift, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1181">I am not so sure that there was a night shift.</sentence><sentence id="1182">I know -- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1183">I never heard that there were.</sentence><sentence id="1184">You would think you would hear by now, but I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1185">My impression is that it was only during the day shift.</sentence><sentence id="1186">I may be wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Q. And you said the smuggling stopped when you -- A. Moved.</sentence><sentence id="1188">Q. Moved from?A. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Q. Why did the smuggling stop at that point?</sentence><sentence id="1190">Did you know why or do you remember why?A. I can only assume that whatever preparations we made, remember, for the general revolt, was no longer valid when we were moving into a new <span class="NPIP">location</span>, when we had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1191">We did not have the access to the -- our shears that we had, to the agricultural tools, to nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1192">We were no longer there.</sentence><sentence id="1195">2 We were coming into a new <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1196">We didn't know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="1197">Suddenly, suddenly it was a new reality.</sentence><sentence id="1198">There was no point, you know, we were too new there to get ourselves oriented to know what we are going to do.</sentence><sentence id="1199">We were there not a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1200">And events started progressing very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1201">Q. So there was an element of fear when you moved, maybe?A. Disorientation.</sentence><sentence id="1202">Disorientation.</sentence><sentence id="1203">The sonderkommando -- the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> blew out when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I believe, meaning that in October, we were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I think, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1204">I'ma little bit confused about the dates.</sentence><sentence id="1205">But if -- if the revolt was, was in October, and we didn't hear it, but Alma told me about it, then we were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1206">So it wasn't so much the fear but with this <span class="NPIP">location</span>, there was disorientation.</sentence><sentence id="1207">You need to be in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a while to start functioning.</sentence><sentence id="1208">Again, this was a new reality, this was something new.</sentence><sentence id="1209">We know now that this was, what, September, let's say, October, a few months till we were finally evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="1210">But at that time, this was a new beginning.</sentence><sentence id="1211">Do you understand what I am saying?Q. Another question.</sentence><sentence id="1212">Tell me about -- oh, between the time that the girls were first taken in November and questioned and then they were released, when they were released, did they also go back to work?</sentence><sentence id="1213">Do you remember?A. I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1214">I don't know about the others.</sentence><sentence id="1215"><span class="BUILDING">Estucia</span> couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1216">Q.

Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1223">3 A. Marta should be interviewed, if she will let you.</sentence><sentence id="1224">Q. In the union, men and women both worked?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1225">Q. And did the men come -- was it about equal numbers?</sentence><sentence id="1226">Tell me little bit of what you remember.</sentence><sentence id="1227">A. The men and women were separated.</sentence><sentence id="1228">The men worked in different department, of course, and the women were working in different department.</sentence><sentence id="1229">I am not sure about the numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1230">Somehow, my impression is that there were more women than men, but there were quite a lot of men as well.</sentence><sentence id="1231">So if my estimate is correct, then during the day shift, there were just about a thousand women, | think.</sentence><sentence id="1232">Because we were in the first 500, and then came the next 500, and it makes a thousand.</sentence><sentence id="1233">Then there would be probably an equivalent number at night.</sentence><sentence id="1234">I'm not sure about those numbers, but just approximately.</sentence><sentence id="1235">Somehow, my feeling is, and this only a feeling, that there were perhaps half the amount of men.</sentence><sentence id="1236">Because maybe a lot of precision work were made by women, while the more rough work was made by man.</sentence><sentence id="1237">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1238">There was little communication except for very specific man who have special professions, let's say an electrician or a machinist, you know, that needed to repair something, and suddenly you would see a man here and a man there.</sentence><sentence id="1239">But most of the time, those were separate.</sentence><sentence id="1240">Except for the time when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Allied planes</span>, in "44, were flying over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they were bombing, there were sirens of air raid coming up, and the electricity would stop.</sentence><sentence id="1241">All</sentence><sentence id="1243">4 the German personnel would grab their gas mask and their outfit, and whatever, and run.</sentence><sentence id="1244">And I never knew where they were running, to what <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> they were running.</sentence><sentence id="1245">And we, the prisoners, would sit under our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1246">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were made out of metal, and this was, in a sense, a protection, not if we wanted protection.</sentence><sentence id="1247">What we desperately wanted was for those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> to please bomb it, finish it, finish it, bomb the production.</sentence><sentence id="1248">Of course they never did.</sentence><sentence id="1249">But during the time when the electricity stopped, you suddenly heard the noise the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> were making when the electricity was on.</sentence><sentence id="1250">There was quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1251">And in this quiet, the Greek men and women across the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> would join in singing.</sentence><sentence id="1252">And it was the most beautiful sound.</sentence><sentence id="1253">I don't know Greek, but I remember the word triana (ph), oh, oh, la triana, and this was a harmony and communication in song all across the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1254">It was one of the most beautiful, beautiful sounds that I remember from union.</sentence><sentence id="1255">I'm sure all those that were there remember this as well.</sentence><sentence id="1256">I wonder where they are.</sentence><sentence id="1257">Q. Back to stopping the smuggling between when you moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, could it have been that Estucia no longer had her contact to pass the gunpowder on, do you think?A. It could very well be.</sentence><sentence id="1258">It could very well be that she no longer had her contacts, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1259">It is quite possible.</sentence><sentence id="1260">Q. But you don't remember -- you don't remember talking to her about stopping it, or anything?A.No.</sentence><sentence id="1263">5 Q. Another question about her.</sentence><sentence id="1264">Do you remember, since she was four or five years older than you, did she try to protect you?</sentence><sentence id="1265">Do you remember?</sentence><sentence id="1266">Did you know that she might have done that?A. Well, of course she wanted to protect me.</sentence><sentence id="1267">If you mean that did I know what she was doing and this way she didn't involve me, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1268">That she wanted to protect me, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1269">She wrote to Marta, telling, her please take care of Hanka for me and then I will die in peace.</sentence><sentence id="1270">In that sense, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1271">To protect me, no.</sentence><sentence id="1272">It wasn't so much for protect me as the security was very strict, you know, we all knew one other person, each one of us, not more than that.</sentence><sentence id="1273">It wasn't so much to protect me when I was involved as is to protect others in terms of security.</sentence><sentence id="1274">No, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1275">No question that she was concerned for me, but not in that sense, no.</sentence><sentence id="1276">Q. Tell me about those messages to Marta.</sentence><sentence id="1277">Because that we didn't -- you didn't talk to me about that in depth.</sentence><sentence id="1278">But those last messages to Marta to take care of you, how did Marta get those messages?A. Marta got those messages from Jakob directly.</sentence><sentence id="1279">Jakob had a great deal of power.</sentence><sentence id="1280">He had the freedom of movement.</sentence><sentence id="1281">Estucia must have asked him to do that, and he actually delivered written paper.</sentence><sentence id="1282">He must be the one that provided them with paper and pens or pencils, what have you, to write on.</sentence><sentence id="1283">He delivered it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marta</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1284">Marta delivered it to me.</sentence><sentence id="1285">The rest were to be through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jakob</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1286">And as I told you before, I was supposed to meet him.</sentence><sentence id="1287">He asked for it and, you know, his word was "important" but it never happened.</sentence><sentence id="1288">But he was the one that -- and Marta, that give the messages in paper, in writing.</sentence><sentence id="1291">6 Q. Were you afraid?</sentence><sentence id="1292">I mean do you remember being afraid during the whole smuggling thing?A. We were terrified.</sentence><sentence id="1293">We were absolutely terrified.</sentence><sentence id="1294">We were terrified of the consequences, but not terrified enough not to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1295">I was terrified every time I was walking with my two boxes under the nose of this <span class="INT_SPACE">glass cubicle</span> where the master -- the director of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> sat.</sentence><sentence id="1296">And I was walking just under him and around him.</sentence><sentence id="1297">Of course I was terrified.</sentence><sentence id="1298">I was panic-stricken.</sentence><sentence id="1299">We were terrified every time we had the gunpowder on us, we were terrified.</sentence><sentence id="1300">But remember, we didn't believe we would survive.</sentence><sentence id="1301">We knew why we are doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1302">Sure, we were terrified.</sentence><sentence id="1303">We were terrified to die anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1304">But there is a difference between terrified to suffer and terrified to die for nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1305">So one overrode the other.</sentence><sentence id="1306">We were wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1307">I was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1308">We survived.</sentence><sentence id="1309">We didn't know at that time that there was any possibility of that.</sentence><sentence id="1310">I was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1311">Does this answer your question?Q. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1312">Now I want to ask you a couple of questions from things that I read, which you may totally disagree with or not know about, and they may be erroneous.</sentence><sentence id="1313">Did you know a kapo named Eugene Koch (ph)?A. No.</sentence><sentence id="1314">Q. Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1315">One account that I read, he might be the one who denounced your sister and the others.</sentence><sentence id="1316">A.

I don't know why, maybe grass is always greener on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, but I always had a feeling that women have a greater capacity for cruelty to each other than men do.</sentence><sentence id="1406">Men do know how to engage in team sport.</sentence><sentence id="1407">Women do not.</sentence><sentence id="1408">I feel -- I may be terribly wrong -- there is a

survival if you were close to somebody, not a whole group of people, but one in particular.</sentence><sentence id="1411">If you lost your family, you adopted a stranger, who became your family.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And this, this perhaps, this maternal instinct, or the need to care, that made it important to survive for each other.</sentence><sentence id="1413">I think that people who felt themselves totally isolated gave up.</sentence><sentence id="1414">But if you had a close link with somebody, you had a better chance for moral and spiritual survival, and therefore a physical one.</sentence><sentence id="1415">I think it is almost impossible to survive alone.</sentence><sentence id="1416">I don't know how men felt about that.</sentence><sentence id="1417">Maybe they were more in a group.</sentence><sentence id="1418">We had this group that met together that were dreaming of a better life, and those were the kind of meaningful encounters that thinking people need to have as a stimulus for living, which is a little</sentence><sentence id="1420">1 bit different than on a one-to-one caring deeply for each other's survival.</sentence><sentence id="1421">I remember when my sister had typhus in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1422">There was a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, did you know that, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau?The</span> non-Jews were allowed to get parcels, and the German prisoners for sure.</sentence><sentence id="1423">And they used to trade these luxuries that they used to get through the parcels for bread or soup or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1424">So there was, in between the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1425">And when Estucia was sick with typhus, she couldn't eat, not the soup and not the bread.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And I used to exchange it for a little bit of sugar, maybe, or an apple, or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1427">And therefore, I had to give her bread and my bread to get it.</sentence><sentence id="1428">I didn't feel the hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And the physical hunger really was not important, but the fact that I am needed to give her something to overcome the typhus was more important.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And she overcame it, and we went back to the regular routine of our meals, if you have.</sentence><sentence id="1431">Somehow I feel that this is more important.</sentence><sentence id="1432">When I was separated from her, and of course the circumstances too, I give up.</sentence><sentence id="1433">If it wouldn't be for Marta, I wouldn't be here.</sentence><sentence id="1434">And Marta was very close to us for the same reason, she lost her family.</sentence><sentence id="1435">And we had affinity to each other, which was very unusual because Marta is from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and we are from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1436">There was a great deal of animosity between the Czechs and the Poles, and the different ethnic groups.</sentence><sentence id="1437">Because the Czech girls, who were the first that came to <span

anywhere, about the newcomers, the new kid in the <span class="DLF">block</span>, the new kid in the class, new immigrants coming to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you know, that type of a thing is almost duplicated in the dynamics of the camp situation.</sentence><sentence id="1439">There was very little love lost between the Czech girls in power and the Polish girls that were Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1440">But Marta and Estucia and I were kinship spirits, and who love each other to this day.</sentence><sentence id="1441">And it is, again, my conviction that this kind of caring for each other helps you overcome.</sentence><sentence id="1442">While when you are alone, I give up.</sentence><sentence id="1443">Marta took care of me.</sentence><sentence id="1444">I don't know whether men experience the same type of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1445">I wouldn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1448">2 know that people desperately, of course, were

you know, either socially or academically, or what have you, but just know that if not your family, somebody from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was there, this became the closest

id="1451">People knowing people that you knew became a kind of a kinship relationship.</sentence><sentence id="1452">I think that in terms of loyalty and solidarity, the situation could have been a little bit better in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> than in the women's.</sentence><sentence id="1453">So there were, you know, these two elements, the elements of a great deal of cruelty and sadism and power wielding, rough brutality, and this great love.</sentence><sentence id="1454">Not so much team playing.</sentence><sentence id="1455">I don't know how it was in the men's

to work, we preferred to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and do nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And not everybody was needed, only a part.</sentence><sentence id="1641">So I found myself a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a beautiful <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, just behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the block

id="1647">And this is how we developed this very strong friendship for years.</sentence><sentence id="1648">Marta, because she was so early in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, was part of the administration clique of the Czech girls, so she had a little bit of pull.</sentence><sentence id="1649">Ah, she used to give us extra things, like a little bit more jam, like my first decent

to tell me to start talking about the story, to put the justice, late justice, to put the history in the proper perspective, to give -- to vindicate the three girls that have been forgotten by the world, that nothing was written or talked about them because nobody did.</sentence><sentence id="1657">And she felt very strongly that it was my responsibility, as a sister, to bring it up and do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And it's only because of Marta's urging that I am doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1659">Marta lives in <span
