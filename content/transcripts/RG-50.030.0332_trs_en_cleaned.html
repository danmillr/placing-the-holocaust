<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1742">Q: So as time went on this got easier or you learned how to live there better?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1744">A: No, the same thing, the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> because they made every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they?</sentence><sentence id="1746">We didn't know the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that they are alive or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1747">Sometimes the farmers used to come from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know, what's going on but other than that they didn't have radios.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1766">Q: But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1768">A: Yeah, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1781">A: Nope.</sentence><sentence id="1782">You know why?</sentence><sentence id="1783">Because we took it each <span class="NPIP">day</span> as it comes.</sentence><sentence id="1784">We did not know what tomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to take for them to kill us all.</sentence><sentence id="1785">So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything.</sentence><sentence id="1786">No hopes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1793">Q: When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any difference to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1795">A: Well, to me, no.</sentence><sentence id="1796">But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it was different.</sentence><sentence id="1797">Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help.</sentence><sentence id="1798">You know what I'm talking?</sentence><sentence id="1799">They didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1800">They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1801">They used to turn down from the <span class="DLF">sky</span> sort of, you know, and fly away.</sentence><sentence id="1802">They never came to <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1803">They did not land.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1815">A: Nope.</sentence><sentence id="1816">You see they, I'll tell you why.</sentence><sentence id="1817">Because they had a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there's no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1818">It has to be a big <span class="NPIP">place</span>, okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans knew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication, whatever it is and they went back up.</sentence><sentence id="1819">But at least we knew that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> knows that we're here.</sentence><sentence id="1820">You understand?</sentence><sentence id="1821">SO, it gave us a different feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1822">But eh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1831">Q: I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans?</sentence><sentence id="1832">How did you know this was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
