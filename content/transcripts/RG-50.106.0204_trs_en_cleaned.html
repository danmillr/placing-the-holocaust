<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: [really don't think there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="77">Things were very intermixed which is quite typical of course for German Jewry who as you know were well assimilated by and large.</sentence><sentence id="78">We lived in two <span class="NPIP">locations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Velatslav</span> [ph] some 15 years ago, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we had lived, didn't exist anymore and the second one hardly at all either.</sentence><sentence id="80">So we lived in two <span class="NPIP">locations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">We had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we had a maid which was kind of expected for any middle class Jewish family, even though my father could hardly afford it but he did have one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: So your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was made up of Jewish and non-Jewish children whom you played with I assume.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Something like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Let's talk a little bit more about your family.</sentence><sentence id="118">Were they very assimilated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Quite, yes.</sentence><sentence id="122">My parents did go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on high holidays.</sentence><sentence id="123">I think the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, the largest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>, was probably conservative.</sentence><sentence id="124">There was Pesach in our family which my father could not conduct but we had an uncle who did know the ritual and he usually conducted the Seder.</sentence><sentence id="125">And there was a large gathering.</sentence><sentence id="126">I would think perhaps about 12, 14 people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> time.</sentence><sentence id="127">But that was about it.</sentence><sentence id="128">I was bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="129">But that was kind of expected.</sentence><sentence id="130">It was socially expected so it was more a social ritual than a religious one.</sentence><sentence id="131">I certainly had no strong religious feelings one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="132">I liked the bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="133">I got lots of presents.</sentence><sentence id="134">So basically our family was yes, assimilated.</sentence><sentence id="135">My father belonged to an organization called Risebund Judische Front Soldaten [ph] .</sentence><sentence id="136">That meant the national organization of Jewish combat soldiers in World War I. He was very proud of that.</sentence><sentence id="137">And again that was a fairly typical attitude on the part of German Jews at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="159">Interview with Guenter Lewy 6 March 18, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: What did you expect?</sentence><sentence id="161">German.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Let's talk also now about your extended family.</sentence><sentence id="165">You mentioned about your uncle helping to conduct the Seder.</sentence><sentence id="166">Did you have a large extended family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: We had a large family yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: On both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">On your mother's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: On both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">Very large family, including grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="176">I enjoyed visiting my grand -- one of my grandparents lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near where my mother had been born, also in <span class="REGION">Silesia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">I enjoyed visiting there.</sentence><sentence id="178">I had some friends there.</sentence><sentence id="179">The most successful in our family was my mother's brother.</sentence><sentence id="180">He had a <span class="BUILDING">business</span>, <span class="BUILDING">wholesale business</span> in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and was very successful.</sentence><sentence id="181">He was really quite rich.</sentence><sentence id="182">And he had been a, also an officer in World War I. He was altogether a very stately German appearance, tall, straight.</sentence><sentence id="183">There is an interesting story connected to him which I think would be of interest.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: His name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: His name was Friedel Lipziger.</sentence><sentence id="187">Lipziger was my mother's maiden name.</sentence><sentence id="188">He considered himself even more German than anyone else in our family because of his background and I remember a family gathering, must have been around 1936 and I, being all of 13, dared to say, I was in a youth movement.</sentence><sentence id="189">I'll come back to that later.</sentence><sentence id="190">I dared to say that perhaps one should think of emigrating and you know this was 36, three years into the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="191">My uncle took me by the scruff and shook me back and forth and said what do you understand about such things?</sentence><sentence id="192">Ok, that was in 1936 I believe.</sentence><sentence id="193">He very soon however must have had, begin to have second thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="194">So to be on the safe side, he started to ship out money, illegally of course and one of the couriers who had my uncle's money was caught and he had a list of names.</sentence><sentence id="195">So one afternoon, my uncle got a telephone call from the police chief of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">Now mind you, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of 600,000 people so the police chief was quite somebody.</sentence><sentence id="197">It so happened that Interview with Guenter Lewy 7 March 18, 2013 he was a war comrade of my uncle.</sentence><sentence id="198">And he said Friedel, this and this has happened.</sentence><sentence id="199">I give you three hours.</sentence><sentence id="200">You must get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">Otherwise I will come to arrest you.</sentence><sentence id="202">So my uncle took his family, his wife and daughter and got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">So that was the end of my uncle who had thought that it was stupid to think of emigrating.</sentence><sentence id="204">He then from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> got to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> where he again opened a highly successful <span class="BUILDING">wood business</span>, which was very appropriate for <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and he became perhaps even richer than before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Let's talk about your life from 1923 to 1933, until Hitler came into power.</sentence><sentence id="226">What memories, I know you were a child, you were only ten years old but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: [have memories.</sentence><sentence id="228">I have rather --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Talk about some of those memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well for one thing, I belonged to a youth movement and that is important for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: At that young age?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Yes, I must have joined perhaps when I was eight, nine, very early.</sentence><sentence id="236">This was a youth movement which called itself German Jewish Boy Scouts.</sentence><sentence id="237">And German Jewish was more German than it was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="238">We sang German songs and we had a little uniform and flags and we would parade up and down and go on hikes and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="239">It also was kind of romantic.</sentence><sentence id="240">It, the German youth movement has been described by writers like Walter Laqueur and others and it had this romantic flavor to it.</sentence><sentence id="241">You were opposed to the philistines and you dreamt of some wonderful future in which you would be important, intellectually perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="242">And so this I think in many ways was very important for my own thinking and, and future life.</sentence><sentence id="243">It sort of shaped me quite significantly I believe.</sentence><sentence id="244">Then came Hitler in 33 and we were forbidden to use uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="245">And then we were also forbidden to go on hikes and on the last hike that we had staged we were attacked in the middle of the night and had to leave and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Attacked because you were a Jewish group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="261">Interview with Guenter Lewy 8 March 18, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: Because we were a Jewish group, hiking which we were -- and, and having a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which we're not supposed to have anymore.</sentence><sentence id="263">But they hadn't informed us that formally so we still were doing it.</sentence><sentence id="264">So that was the end of hiking and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: Who was the leader of your group?</sentence><sentence id="266">The adult leader?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: The leader of my group was someone called Walter Laqueur who was quite known as an historian.</sentence><sentence id="268">He was all of two years older than we were in this group but he was our leader.</sentence><sentence id="269">That's how he was known.</sentence><sentence id="270">And we would get together and several times a month and read things and discuss things or listen to classical music and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="271">Then about 1934 it must have been, perhaps 35, our organization merged with a Zionist organization called Zichloiter and that organization in turn eventually became part of Hashomer Hatzair.</sentence><sentence id="272">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hashomer Hatzair</span> is something that eventually became known in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mapai</span>, as you probably know.</sentence><sentence id="273">So our, the character of our life changed in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="274">We all of a sudden started to sing Jewish and Hebrew songs and learn something about our Jewish background of which we were frightfully ignorant until then.</sentence><sentence id="275">And we became kind of Zionists, gradually.</sentence><sentence id="276">And this went on for a few years.</sentence><sentence id="277">And then came Kristallnacht in November of 1938.Now shortly before that I had gone to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> in preparation for going to what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">And it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hasharav</span> [ph].</sentence><sentence id="279">That term means something for you.</sentence><sentence id="280">And we were there, about 30 Jewish kids and we were learning agriculture.</sentence><sentence id="281">And on Kristallnacht the first thing we heard things over the radio.</sentence><sentence id="282">And it was too late to leave so we sort of barricaded ourselves and hoped for the best.</sentence><sentence id="283">But sure enough a large group of storm troopers eventually appeared and attacked and beat us up rather badly.</sentence><sentence id="284">And some people were hurt.</sentence><sentence id="285">And the event dispersed and everyone went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> my father had been arrested, like all German Jews at the time, all male German Jews and taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">And now I come back to Henry, my father's name.</sentence><sentence id="289">As I said his father had been an Anglophile.</sentence><sentence id="290">He had been called Henry.</sentence><sentence id="291">Came World War I and my father volunteered for military service to fight against the perfidious Albion.</sentence><sentence id="292">You could not be called Henry.</sentence><sentence id="293">So they changed his name to Heinrich.</sentence><sentence id="294">So some of his papers were Heinrich and some of his papers were Henry.</sentence><sentence id="295">And of course that became a cause Celebrex for the German Interview with Guenter Lewy 9 March 18, 2013 bureaucracy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="296">They didn't know what to make of it.</sentence><sentence id="297">And he therefore was one of the last to get out.</sentence><sentence id="298">The procedure was that you would, they would let people out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, if they had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to, to emigrate.</sentence><sentence id="299">The whole, one of the main purposes of the arrest of the male Jews was to put pressure on them to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">At that time, and that is also confirmed by written documents that we have.</sentence><sentence id="301">The main idea was to push the Jews out, get rid of them.</sentence><sentence id="302">And so if you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to emigrate to, they would release you.</sentence><sentence id="303">But because of my father, with this mix up of names, he was one of the last to get out, even though we had a possibility to leave.</sentence><sentence id="304">Now this is, this involves the following.</sentence><sentence id="305">My father's brother and sister had been early Zionists.</sentence><sentence id="306">They had belonged to a German Zionist organization called Blue White, Blau Weis, very well known.</sentence><sentence id="307">And they left for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in the 20s already and had become well established in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">My aunt, my father's sister was a librarian at the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">My, his brother was a well-known architect in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">And they tried to get permission for my parents to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Their names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Bruno Lewy and Alma Shunami.</sentence><sentence id="360">She married a man who became quite well known after World War II, Alex Shunami, because he was sent by the Yeshuv to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="361">He was a librarian as well to recover stolen German books and became quite well known in that capacity.</sentence><sentence id="362">He was very successful.</sentence><sentence id="363">He got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and an American chauffeur and he was able to move all around and recover German books by the thousands, stolen Jewish books by the thousands.</sentence><sentence id="364">Anyway that was my aunt's husband.</sentence><sentence id="365">They tried to get permission for my parents to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> but the British did not let any adults in.</sentence><sentence id="366">They let young people in, but not adults.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: Was your father a Zionist?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: No, not at all but you know by that time he had realized.</sentence><sentence id="378">I mean after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> in particular --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Preceding that, he had not been.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="381">Interview with Guenter Lewy 10 March 18, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: They may have been thinking about emigrating but nothing concrete had happened.</sentence><sentence id="383">The problem, as you probably know, was to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take you.</sentence><sentence id="384">The problem was not to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take you.</sentence><sentence id="385">There was legal emigration out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until October 1941.</sentence><sentence id="386">So the problem was to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, not to get out, get permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">The Nazis were pushing the Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="388">So he had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> but my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> worked very hard on this and it didn't move forward.</sentence><sentence id="389">So as an interim measure, they came up with the following.</sentence><sentence id="390">My uncle's wife was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and her brother was Grand redam [ph] de <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> so the chief rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, the chief rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="391">So they arranged for a permit for my parents to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="392">And so I left in March of 39 for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with Youth Aliyah, because I wanted to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="393">And my parents shortly thereafter left for <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="394">So I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in March of 1939 and went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: We'll get to that.</sentence><sentence id="409">How did your parents feel about your desire to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: They were not crazy about it.</sentence><sentence id="413">They would have preferred if I had stayed with them, but they respected my wish and accepted it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

precise.</sentence><sentence id="903">I mean one heard all kinds of things, but I don't think it was very, information was very precise no.</sentence><sentence id="904">One knew that things were bad for the Jews, but I don't think we knew about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="905">At least I don't recall, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="906">I don't think so.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="907">One of our favorite past times was what we would do if we could get ahold of Hitler and how we would treat him and what we would do to him to make up for things.</sentence><sentence id="908">But other than that, one felt rather impotent.</sentence><sentence id="909">There was nothing one could do.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="910">When the war ended of course, on the other hand, we started to see the first displaced people, displaced persons, survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and the brigade as you probably know.</sentence><sentence id="911">This is all a matter of record, was instrumental in organizing the illegal migration of survivors to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="912">And we were involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="913">And there I can tell a very interesting story.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="914">We were at that point, I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in some small --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="915">Q: To back up before you tell the story.</sentence><sentence id="916">What was your reaction at the time of liberation?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="917">A: Well liberation.</sentence><sentence id="918">We did not experience liberation at any clear sense of the date.</sentence><sentence id="919">The war ended, the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="920">We started to see displaced persons, survivors.</sentence><sentence id="921">And at that point one begin, you know we started to hear more precise stories of survivors who I was told about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="922">Some of them we saw in their original clothing, the striped clothing.</sentence><sentence id="923">And large numbers of them came across and they f--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="924">Q: Do you remember any emotional reaction you had at the time.</sentence><sentence id="925">You were in your early 20s.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: I don't recall any particular reaction, other than what I said before.</sentence><sentence id="927">One felt very, had strong feeling about Hitler, about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="928">In fact when the brigade was moved, we moved by, with our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="929">Some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drivers</span>, they amused themselves by running down Germans on the <span class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="930">And we probably thought that was ok at the time.</sentence><sentence id="931">I feel bad about it now.</sentence><sentence id="932">I don't enjoy that memory but I know it happened.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="934">Interview with Guenter Lewy 22 March 18, 2013 And it was kind of a natural reaction because of what we had seen, and what we had heard and what we had encountered.</sentence><sentence id="935">I should say a little about something else, namely our participation in combat, as part of Montgomery's Eighth Army.</sentence><sentence id="936">We were, we occupied a segment of the front and right next to us was a Polish unit, And these were the Anders soldiers who had left <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and come to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> and who also then became part of the British army.</sentence><sentence id="937">And they, hearing that there were Jews next to them, they amused themselves by cutting our <span class="DLF">telephone wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="938">Occasionally.</sentence><sentence id="939">So there were no good feelings between us, even though we were fighting the same enemy.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="940">It so happened that I was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> that took the first German prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="941">And that came about kind of fortuitously without design.</sentence><sentence id="942">We went out on a combat patrol towards the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> and got, went a little further.</sentence><sentence id="943">We were about a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">squad</span> perhaps of eight with an officer.</sentence><sentence id="944">And we moved a little further ahead without intending to perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="945">And all of a sudden found ourselves in the <span class="DLF">German line</span> and there was a <span class="BUILDING">German shelter</span>, a dug out and we heard voices <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">And I was the only German speaking one.</sentence><sentence id="947">And I shouted down Raus, Juden en dar and that became a big story because this was the first time that the brigade had taken German prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="948">And my shouting Raus, Juden en dar made all the newspapers and became --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="949">Q: Which translates into?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="950">A: Out, out, the Jews are here.</sentence><sentence id="951">And they came out about ten of them, scared, when they heard that they would be captured by Jews.</sentence><sentence id="952">We took them back to our <span class="DLF">lines</span> and they were interrogated Ipresume.</sentence><sentence id="953">And that became a big story because the first time that a brigade had taken prisoners and it was a big item in the newspapers and pictures and my cousins, my uncle and I have two cousins there who were children of my uncle and my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">They were very proud of course about their cousin who all of a sudden was supposed to be a big hero.</sentence><sentence id="955">It was a heroism that as I say came about fortuitously because we really hadn't anticipated to get that far but we did and it worked out well.</sentence><sentence id="956">They shot at us on the way back but we all got back with no problem.</sentence><sentence id="957">So that was that.</sentence><sentence id="958">And other than that it was not, there was no close combat.</sentence><sentence id="959">The <span class="DLF">lines</span> kind of moved gradually.</sentence><sentence id="960">They moved back.</sentence><sentence id="961">We moved forward without any clear contact.</sentence><sentence id="962">There was artillery shelling on and off.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="964">Interview with Guenter Lewy 23 March 18, 2013 One other thing which is kind of interesting.</sentence><sentence id="965">We were living in an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> for a time, on <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, that's one slept, perhaps ten of us.</sentence><sentence id="966">And one day there was a call to send one of us to a course for some further training.</sentence><sentence id="967">I don't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="968">And they chose me and I was sent back so I was not there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="969">And apparently that same night somebody smoked and the thing went up in flames, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> went up in flames and everyone died.</sentence><sentence id="970">So if I hadn't been sent to that course, I wouldn't be sitting here today.</sentence><sentence id="971">But that's one of those things that happens.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="972">The war then ended as I say and we were, we moved up to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="973">Q: Were there any celebrations at the end of the war?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="974">A: I don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="975">I do recall one other <span class="NPIP">thing</span> and that is interesting.</sentence><sentence id="976">When we were billeted in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austrian town</span> for a time, the illegal migration required quite a bit of money.</sentence><sentence id="977">One had to bribe, one had to get <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="978">They used our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="979">I mean it's an amazing thing.</sentence><sentence id="980">There is a tape about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish brigade</span> which describes this with pictures.</sentence><sentence id="981">It was amazing.</sentence><sentence id="982">We used our official <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to transport these people to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="983">How we got away with it I don't know but we had our own military police, that's why.</sentence><sentence id="984">We had our own military police.</sentence><sentence id="985">There was no one who could stop us.</sentence><sentence id="986">I mean so that was done.</sentence><sentence id="987">But it required money, lots of money.</sentence><sentence id="988">And we all contributed as best we could.</sentence><sentence id="989">We didn't have very much money.</sentence><sentence id="990">But so one day three of us in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austrian town</span> thought well maybe we can liberate some money for the good cause.</sentence><sentence id="991">So we went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we came to some very fancy <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we went in and right in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> was a big picture of an SS man and a woman was there, his wife and daughter.</sentence><sentence id="992">We searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then we found a large sum of money which we confiscated and liberated and handed over to the captain of our unit who was in charge of collecting money.</sentence><sentence id="993">Well the woman went first to the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="994">And then the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> came to the company commander and said three soldiers had robbed this woman of all her money and that's unacceptable and the commander had to agree, yes it's unacceptable.</sentence><sentence id="995">So it was decided that next morning the company would be lined up on the <span class="DLF">town square</span>.</sentence><sentence id="996">The women would try to identify the culprits.</sentence><sentence id="997">Well our commander of course had heard what and why what had happened and why, what had happened to the money.</sentence><sentence id="998">So when the company lined up on the <span class="DLF">village square</span>, the three of us, we're not part of the lineup.</sentence><sentence id="999">We were allowed to go up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> a little bit Interview with Guenter Lewy 24 March 18, 2013 and we watched the whole procedure from top.</sentence><sentence id="1000">That is described also in the book called The Brigade.</sentence><sentence id="1001">There's a book called The Brigade where the incident is described.</sentence><sentence id="1002">It was kind of fun to look down how she went around and tried of find us and of course we weren't in the lineup.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1033">Q: She didn't falsely accuse anybody else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1035">A: I'm sorry, no she did not.</sentence><sentence id="1036">No, no she did not, no.</sentence><sentence id="1037">Ok so to come back to -- we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">The brigade was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and I found guarding these German prisoners when they were clearing the <span class="DLF">mines</span> not a very interesting occupation, a boring and I thought it would be nice to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1039">So I went AWOL, A-W-L. It meant you know leave without, leave without permission and I hitchhiked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the British occupation and presented myself and said here I am.</sentence><sentence id="1040">I know German and I think I could be more useful in this capacity.</sentence><sentence id="1041">He said yes it sounds good.</sentence><sentence id="1042">So I was transferred to a military police unit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuppertal</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr</span> as an interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="1043">And I must have done this for about half a year.</sentence><sentence id="1044">That was much more interesting and we would occasionally pick up some people.</sentence><sentence id="1045">You know and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1046">It was a much more interesting time.</sentence><sentence id="1047">But then came demobilization.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1061">Q: What was your gut feeling talking to these Germans?</sentence><sentence id="1062">Were these German soldiers or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1063">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Civilians.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1065">Q: What was your gut feeling in talking to them as a Jew?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1067">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1068">I just found it interesting to be there.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I don't recall any -- I mean as I had mentioned before when first we encountered these survivors, we had rather strong feelings but <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was smashed and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which we found ourselves, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuppertal</span>, probably wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> standing.</sentence><sentence id="1070">And it was kind of hard to have any strong negative feelings to these people who are scratching around, trying to find enough to eat and who were obviously in miserable shape at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1071">So I don't think we had, I had any particularly strong feelings at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Interview with Guenter Lewy 25 March 18, 2013 Then came demobilization, That is to say what came from the brigade that my turn had come to go back.</sentence><sentence id="1073">We are all being sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for demobilization.</sentence><sentence id="1074">I was sent back and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demobilization camp</span> was in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holon</span> which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1086">A: No, I don't think I felt that being back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but as I say I don't have, I don't recall any particular strong feelings one way or the other just that it was an interesting time and good time.</sentence><sentence id="1087">I mean I was well paid and I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, in contrast to before.</sentence><sentence id="1088">I actually I forgot to mention.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I was promoted to corporal while we were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1090">But again I one day decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> to visit my family and I had a girlfriend there.</sentence><sentence id="1091">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> on which I was traveling was stopped by military police and I was caught without a pass.</sentence><sentence id="1092">And I ended up overnight in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and the next morning I lost my stripes as corporal.</sentence><sentence id="1093">And I was a private again.</sentence><sentence id="1094">But when we were in the brigade after that episode of the capturing the German prisoners, I was promoted and eventually became a sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="1095">Now being a sergeant in the British army is nothing great.</sentence><sentence id="1096">I mean you're a noncommissioned officer but it's no great fanciful existence and in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> particularly the food was very bad and never enough.</sentence><sentence id="1097">We would sometimes smuggle ourselves into the <span class="INT_SPACE">mess hall</span> twice even though it was risky because we just didn't have enough and word had it that our cooks were selling out the food on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and making a fortune.</sentence><sentence id="1098">But yeah so I was a sergeant and as a sergeant then I was the interpreter in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that was another good existence.</sentence><sentence id="1099">Had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Eventually I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1101">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demobilization camp</span> was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rehovot</span> and I remembered that

particularly friendly with her but I remembered her.</sentence><sentence id="1104">And I remember her being from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rehovot</span> and I made some inquiries and I looked her up and she eventually became my wife.</sentence><sentence id="1105">We became engaged several months later.</sentence><sentence id="1106">And she had been studying medicine since there was no anatomy,

university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beirut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1108">There was a <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1109">But then when the war broke out and after the end of Interview with Guenter Lewy 26 March 18, 2013 World War II, all the Israeli students had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1110">And she went to Geneva

decided at that point to visit my parents because I hadn't seen them since 1939.</sentence><sentence id="1113">And I eventually got a visa.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Yes, one other thing I can relate -- two things actually.</sentence><sentence id="1115">One I was still in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1116">I would be able to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demobilization camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1117">The procedure was rather lengthy and bureaucratic.</sentence><sentence id="1118">I don't know why but it was, took a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1119">So we were allowed to go back to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had lived.</sentence><sentence id="1120">I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>,

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1928">What your thoughts are on that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1929">A: We have had episodes of genocide, numerous since 1945 so that problem is not solved.</sentence><sentence id="1930">Pretty horrible episodes of violence have taken place.</sentence><sentence id="1931">I think the Holocaust was not unique, precisely because more genocides have taken place since.</sentence><sentence id="1932">It was in many sense, cases unprecedented.</sentence><sentence id="1933">It was unprecedented that they, cultured nation in the center of Europe would organize this program to exterminate an entire people, man, woman and child and hunt them down all over the continent.</sentence><sentence id="1934">In that sense it was unprecedented.</sentence><sentence id="1935">It never happened before.</sentence><sentence id="1936">The Interview with Guenter Lewy 43 March 18, 2013 Jews were not particularly hostile to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1937">On the contrary the German Jews were better Germans than many Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And yet it took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1939">So in that sense it was something quite unprecedented.</sentence><sentence id="1940">It was not unique as I say because we've had genocides since and we unfortunately are, haven't solved that problem yet.</sentence><sentence id="1941">And we may never be able to solve it.</sentence><sentence id="1942">If, when I'm finished with my book on book censorship in Nazi Germany, if I still have what it takes to write another one, I want to do something on the perpetrators, the Nazi perpetrators, why they did it, how, various explanations that have been put forth.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And I sort of want to bring all that together.</sentence><sentence id="1944">There is some interesting work being done on this in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> today.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1962">Q: You said you had done some work at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1964">A: Iwas a volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="1965">That's, for a time I did some projects for them.</sentence><sentence id="1966">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1970">Q: What kind of projects?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1972">A: I did a project on the bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1973">And I felt that their exhibit was misleading.</sentence><sentence id="1974">And I think they have changed it a bit since then.</sentence><sentence id="1975">There has been some other writing on this by other researchers as well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1980">Q: How was their exhibit misleading?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1982">A: Well they sort of implied very strongly at the begin -- in the original exhibit that it was a serious dereliction on the part of the Americans that they did not bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1983">And I tried to show that A, the ability to hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with any precision was strictly limited.</sentence><sentence id="1984">We didn't have the <span class="BUILDING">bases</span> close enough to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with any great numbers of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1985">Hitting with precision was altogether impossible at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1986">All one could do was carpet bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1987">That's why the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> looked what they looked after the war because there was no precision bomb.</sentence><sentence id="1988">They, so it would have been pretty impossible really to, to hit the Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> without killing off all the Jews and it probably would not have really done very much.</sentence><sentence id="1989">So my feeling was that the decision not to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> pursued because Roosevelt wanted, felt that the most important thing to do was to win the war as quickly as possible.</sentence><sentence id="1990">And all the resources Interview with Guenter Lewy 44 March 18, 2013 available probably was the right decision.</sentence><sentence id="1991">And the exhibit implied differently but I think they have possibly adjusted this a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1992">I haven't checked it out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2006">Anything.</sentence><sentence id="2007">Did you follow it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2011">A: Idid sure I did, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2012">I have done some work, some articles on <span class="BUILDING">war crimes tribunals</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2013">I am not particularly proud of the Eichmann trial.</sentence><sentence id="2014">I think it did not follow the highest possible standards.</sentence><sentence id="2015">I think he got what was due him, needless to say.</sentence><sentence id="2016">He was guilty as can be.</sentence><sentence id="2017">But I think the trial was not the most dignified and the, especially in the role of the prosecutor.</sentence><sentence id="2018">I've forgotten his name now.</sentence><sentence id="2019">It was a little bit.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2057">A: I think it's great.</sentence><sentence id="2058">I had some problems with the leadership at one point.</sentence><sentence id="2059">They organized a symposium on the Gypsies, the prosecution of the Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="2060">And they did not invite me because I had written the only book in English on the subject but my position was that the Gypsies had not suffered as the Jews had suffered.</sentence><sentence id="2061">And I developed that in a fairly, a very carefully researched book.</sentence><sentence id="2062">I spent a year in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, collecting material.</sentence><sentence id="2063">The official view at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> was because, that the Gypsies had been treated like Jews and deserved to be, that this was an instance of genocide and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2064">And the symposium was supposed to be focused on that.</sentence><sentence id="2065">And they didn't invite me.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And an American Gypsy at that time was a member of the Holocaust Interview with Guenter Lewy 45 March 18, 2013 Council.</sentence><sentence id="2067">And he was kind of a pseudo scholar who propagated that view that the Gypsies had suffered genocide.</sentence><sentence id="2068">And the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> bought it and I objected and I said it's not a matter of my personal pride or my prestige to be at this symposium.</sentence><sentence id="2069">But I think you are going on the wrong track and you should at least listen to my position.</sentence><sentence id="2070">So they at last course invited me.</sentence><sentence id="2071">I gave a paper which was then published in the, in the series there.</sentence><sentence id="2072">I don't know to what extent they have changed their view.</sentence><sentence id="2073">They, another issue that I found problematic was the treatment of the Armenians.</sentence><sentence id="2074">I have written a book on that as one of my last books.</sentence><sentence id="2075">And again I did not, I concluded after careful research that while the Armenians suffered terribly and lost 40% of their people in massacres, it was not a state sponsored program of genocide.</sentence><sentence id="2076">And that too is not the conventional wisdom and apparently also was not the view of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2077">They occasionally have had exhibits on the Armenian genocide which I don't accept.</sentence><sentence id="2078">So I've had my differences with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, but I think basically of course they are doing very good work and it's a very important institution.</sentence></p></dialogue>
