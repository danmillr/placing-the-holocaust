<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: Tell me what else it was like in 1935, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, for a Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Well, you couldn't go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> but to Jewish organizations.</sentence><sentence id="90">There were lots of young people who had not given up hope that things would change in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we went out together.</sentence><sentence id="91">We had meetings together, and one of the things I recall is that on Mardi Gras of 1936, at a time when I already knew I was going to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, I went out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with some friends and the public was all heppped up and they were all in good humor and playing around and they were stopping <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> and uh trying to lift them up.</sentence><sentence id="92">There was nothing bad involved "till suddenly a contingent of SS men came from the side <span class="DLF">streets</span> with their swords out and just started hitting indiscriminately anybody who was in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">I got a cut in my winter coat at that time because I wasn't running fast enough.</sentence><sentence id="94">Otherwise I did not spend much time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">Before that, in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hornburg</span> (ph) in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> where I spent my working time in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I was employed, things were different.</sentence><sentence id="96">During the winter when the only the people of that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were there, I didn't have much trouble, but this was a place that had many guests came up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> in the summer for vacations and so and I learned soon to keep by myself because on two occasions I was once thrown out of a <span class="BUILDING">coffee shop</span> where I was sitting with people from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and once was just beaten uh up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> which cost me fortunately only my glasses.</sentence><sentence id="97">I even was asked to apply to come, to enter the German Armed Forces because I was in the age group that was called up and the uh mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hornburg</span> insisted that I go through the formalities because he thought I was such a good man that they needed me, but they after they had I had a physical examination and they got the uh information about my parents and ancestors I got the information that they could very well do without me.</sentence><sentence id="98">Then, to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, I had applied to leave for <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> as a student in archeology since I had had uh my background with the <span class="BUILDING">Humanistic Gymnasium</span>, knew the ancient languages and in addition to this my older sister had gone, had had the opportunity to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> even earlier.</sentence><sentence id="99">After about two and a half months of efforts and a number of very uh uneasy meetings with officials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, I indeed got a visa, got a passport to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">I found out afterwards that at the same time I left, the Greek police for foreigners was informed that this guy is not really a student - he is a Jewish refugee and due to this information I had quite a bit of difficulty staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">But I arrived there in 19.., in February, end of February of "36.</sentence><sentence id="102">Was met by my sister.</sentence><sentence id="103">After a nice journey, and I was quite elated to have left the Third Reich, my sister had made some friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">She was mainly giving language lessons there, and after some weeks, I got various jobs.</sentence><sentence id="105">I had brought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> with me and a pair of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">skis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">Nothing else.</sentence><sentence id="107">The pair of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">skis</span> was to show that I was a student.</sentence><sentence id="108">I was not apt to forget my favorite sport.</sentence><sentence id="109">And, believe it or not, I did go skiing in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>--in the Peloponnese--which was nice.</sentence><sentence id="110">I got various jobs in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and the mentality there of the people who employed me was such that they would trust me more than any of their other employees which was to my advantage.</sentence><sentence id="111">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">technical office</span> where we imported all kinds of electrical equipment from the rest of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="112">They considered very small as outside of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="113">I think at that time I worked for them for three years.</sentence><sentence id="114">Then in, after working for him which was actually part-time, I went in the late afternoon to a <span class="BUILDING">newspaper distributing office</span> to - whom I had been recommended to and uh the way I, my first impression of that job was quite interesting.</sentence><sentence id="115">The uh owner of the (ph), which means (ph) newspaper agency, took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the foreign newspaper department and there behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> uh was a young man with not one but uh three signs that he was a member of the Nazi party and he talked to me in French.</sentence><sentence id="116">He never knew that I was German.</sentence><sentence id="117">He was, and he handed the department over to me because he had been called back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> he told me.</sentence><sentence id="118">He was already gone the next day and the boss and I were left with quite a mess because there were quite a number of subscriptions to German Nazi papers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> for Germans who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and when I started sending somebody around to collect subscription monies that according to the books they owned us, they had all been paid and the predecessor of mine evidentially had pocketed the money.</sentence><sentence id="119">I started the work in that department with quite a uh debt, and the only way after, during the two and one-half years I worked there we could eradicate that debt was by ordering lots of newspapers from the various provinces in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, five copies from this one, five copies from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">Naturally nobody would buy that stuff even, so we would distribute it to the various <span class="BUILDING">kiosks</span> and when we got it back you cut the top off, send it back so that you didn't have to pay for it, and the rest of the paper was sold as uh, and we uh wegot credit for it and eventually we wiped out that debt which amounted in quite, to quite a - I think it was over 100,000 pounds.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Yes, alright.</sentence><sentence id="166">What happened after that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: My parents came - we brought my parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> one year after I came and we uh, my father had some representation from a <span class="BUILDING">chemical factory</span> who thought they could sell their pills in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> but after, by the end of 1938 the Greek government wouldn't allow us anymore to renew our permit of residence in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">They informed us that they knew from the German uh authorities that they would be very happy to welcome us back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">We were not anxious.</sentence><sentence id="172">The four of us, my parents, my sister and I, we went from one <span class="BUILDING">foreign consulate</span> to the other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> to try and get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to uh go to.</sentence><sentence id="173">And this was quite difficult.</sentence><sentence id="174">We once thought we had a, we thought to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> but when we went to buy steamship tickets, we found out that that consul was only an honorary consul, and wasn't supposed to give visas out and after some difficulty we got half our money back.</sentence><sentence id="175">Then thanks to my father's connection with the Free Masons - it's a masonic order in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> - we found a man in the <span class="BUILDING">British Embassy</span> who helped to get us out.</sentence><sentence id="176">His connection through the CID caused them to check our family tree.</sentence><sentence id="177">And they found--which we knew, which was correct--that my mother was related to Walter Rathenau, who had been the foreign secretary of the Weimar Republic after the First World War and who also was about the first victim of Nazi murder in 1923 already.</sentence><sentence id="178">They told us we could proceed any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the British Empire we wanted to go to, provided we had the means to do so.</sentence><sentence id="179">Closest <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the island of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span>; but <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> required for anyone who came there one thousand pounds to show in cash.</sentence><sentence id="180">We didn't have that kind of money.</sentence><sentence id="181">So the British Ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> caused them to reduce this amount to a thousand pounds for the whole family--for the four of us--which was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="182">The only drawback was we didn't have the thousand pounds.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I managed to go to the two main employers I had, and I borrowed from each one five hundred pounds in Greek money.</sentence><sentence id="184">So we put that on an account in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span>, and we were...we managed to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">Half a year later, I could send them the money back.</sentence><sentence id="186">But that was uh a break we got, because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="187">We arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> in the beginning of March of 1939.</sentence><sentence id="188">And in uh...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limassol</span>, my father promptly got sick.</sentence><sentence id="189">We were stuck there in a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for quite a while.</sentence><sentence id="190">After that we moved to the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicosia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">I got a job in an <span class="BUILDING">import office</span>, and my sister got a job in another...in a <span class="BUILDING">technical office</span> also.</sentence><sentence id="192">But in September of "39, when <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> entered the war, I came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I found a note in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span>: "Do not come back."</sentence><sentence id="193">Because business was dead;
