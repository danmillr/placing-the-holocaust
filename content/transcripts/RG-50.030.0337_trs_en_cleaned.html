<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="10">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and personal background in terms of -- a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span>, a politically active <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: Well, let's see.</sentence><sentence id="13">I moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elizabeth</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and it was in 1917.</sentence><sentence id="14">We -- it was a combination of <span class="BUILDING">households</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">I lost my father at that time, and we were going to move in with my grandfather, and he passed away.</sentence><sentence id="16">And so we were there along my -- my mother with two children and her mother.</sentence><sentence id="17">And so we had to get along.</sentence><sentence id="18">My education was in the New York school system.</sentence><sentence id="19">I went to <span class="BUILDING">New York University</span>, got a degree in finance, did graduate work in economics.</sentence><sentence id="20">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night, worked during the daytime, various jobs.</sentence><sentence id="21">One job, though, that I took in 1929, I was working in the credit department of a <span class="BUILDING">mercantile firm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">Working in the credit department decided me on becoming a credit man.</sentence><sentence id="23">And so in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I studied credits and collections.</sentence><sentence id="24">That was the subject of my major and accounting.</sentence><sentence id="25">In 1929, though, I switched over from this particular <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> and went into the banking business.</sentence><sentence id="26">As part of my banking training I was going to become a banker and a businessman.</sentence><sentence id="27">Went into the <span class="BUILDING">Manufacturers Trust Company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">I started working for the <span class="BUILDING">Manufacturers Company</span> a few days before Black Friday in 1929.</sentence><sentence id="29">And I guess that probably influenced my career.</sentence><sentence id="30">Anyhow, I was with the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> until 1936.</sentence><sentence id="31">They got looking around to see how things were going.</sentence><sentence id="32">Somebody suggested that I see the JDC, Joint Distribution Committee, and they asked me to come in to do a special job that needed doing.</sentence><sentence id="33">And in due course I was prevailed upon to give them one year out of my life to do this special job.</sentence><sentence id="34">The one year out of my life turned out to be about 60 years.</sentence><sentence id="35">That was a very long agreement.</sentence><sentence id="36">I worked in the New York headquarters office of the Joint Distribution Committee.</sentence><sentence id="37">Then until 1939 -- I was there until November.</sentence><sentence id="38">How come?</sentence><sentence id="39">The war began in September.</sentence><sentence id="40">It became apparent to me as it did to others that</sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">circumstances will have changed in Europe, and JDC would need all the help it could over in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="44">I volunteered to go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">I was accepted, and I went <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">And I arrived <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> in December 1939.</sentence><sentence id="47">My first permanent job, we thought would be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, where I served as the secretary of the European Executive Council of the JDC and did my job there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="48">The head of the overseas operations at that time was a man by the name of Morris Troper, T-1-0-p-e-r, who was the director general of the overseas operation of the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="49">He was joined by a man by the name of Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who came over to Europe at that time to join Mr. Troper.</sentence><sentence id="50">Joe Schwartz landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, joined Troper, who was going to <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>, who at that time was making a visit around in Europe to make plans with the agencies with which the JDC was cooperating for the event that war would ensue and we would be cut off.</sentence><sentence id="51">While they were <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>, war did ensue.</sentence><sentence id="52">While they were traveling around in Europe, war did come along.</sentence><sentence id="53">That was in June 1940.</sentence><sentence id="54">They were traveling around.</sentence><sentence id="55">The Germans were practically knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">I was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">It was the <span class="BUILDING">European headquarters</span>, I was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="58">After making diligent inquiry, I came to the conclusion that the JDC has to move its <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">It couldn't remain there.</sentence><sentence id="60">Having arranged with other Jewish organizations working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> at the time, like ORT-HIAS, the French-Jewish organizations and so on, none of us would move without advising the others.</sentence><sentence id="61">I came to the conclusion on a Sunday that we were going to move out, having consulted with the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span>, who at that time were following up the French, who were making up their minds as to whether they wanted to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or not and so on.</sentence><sentence id="62">Decided to close up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and to move out.</sentence><sentence id="63">That was on Monday -- it's Monday -- that was on Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="64">I guess that was on June the 8th or -- if that was a Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="65">Anyhow, that Sunday around June, decided to close the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">Closed the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, moved -- intended originally to move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Couldn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span> because the French government had decided that they were going to evacuate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span>, and they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to such an extent that nobody else would be permitted to come in.</sentence><sentence id="68">In that same Sunday, when we decided to close the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, I had to phone the staff to ask them to come into Monday, prepare to travel out, we're leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">They came in Monday to leave the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage</span> and so on, and they went over to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="73">I came there when I -- as I began to say, in that Sunday I phoned around to tell the other agencies we decided to move to discover that they had already left without telling us.</sentence><sentence id="74">And the JDC was the only Jewish organization, welfare organization, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, all by ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="75">Well, Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Troper came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on Monday.</sentence><sentence id="76">The rest of the staff had left.</sentence><sentence id="77">I had kept the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> open.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="78">There were just one -- two secretaries, myself and -- no, three secretaries, myself and then the two gentlemen who came back.</sentence><sentence id="79">We closed down the -- closed down the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> on Tuesday, and the Germans came in on Thursday.</sentence><sentence id="80">As I said, we've started out for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tours</span>, we couldn't get in, had to change directions.</sentence><sentence id="81">We ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">We moved the <span class="BUILDING">JDC headquarters</span> over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Can I interrupt you here.</sentence><sentence id="84">I have a question.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: You were in Europe already when there had been quite a build up, and the war certainly had started --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: -- in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="90">What was the mood?</sentence><sentence id="91">What did you think was going to happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: The mood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was very confusing at the time, because when you walked down the Champs Elysees, you had the impression there was absolutely nothing going on, everything looked normal.</sentence><sentence id="96">And you couldn't tell by looking around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that anything was happening at all.</sentence><sentence id="97">And I think that up to that point the French had the feeling that their army was invincible, and they were going to stop off the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="98">Well, it was misplaced, as you know.</sentence><sentence id="99">So that -- we ended up, then, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">We moved the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> down there.</sentence><sentence id="101">We sent out the cables to all the agencies in Europe with which we had been operating to tell them where our new <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>, to discover later on that the center had held up the cables, and none of them had gone out.</sentence><sentence id="102">They were held up by the center, by the military people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> (ph) for about four or five days.</sentence><sentence id="104">Government in the meantime had moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">The Germans knew that, and threatened to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">As a matter of fact, they did drop a couple of bombs around the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to let the French know that they're still around.</sentence><sentence id="107">And the French, then, had sat down</sentence><sentence id="109">and said, "Anybody who wants to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>, must leave by midnight of a certain day or you can't get out."</sentence><sentence id="110">So we were there.</sentence><sentence id="111">Troper, the couple of secretaries and I, Schwartz (ph), we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">We decided to get out.</sentence><sentence id="113">We made the midnight deadline, slept out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, just to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">As a matter of fact, the <span class="DLF">road</span> were so crowded at that time with refugees -- who were coming down from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and from <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> going down to <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> -- that the automobile trip that normally took seven hours from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>, it took us three days to get down there.</sentence><sentence id="115">The <span class="DLF">roads</span> were that crowded with refugees.</sentence><sentence id="116">And we had hardships along the <span class="DLF">road</span> too, ran out of gasoline and shelter and all that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="117">So we decided then to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">We did that and headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> and decided that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was the furthest west one could go in Europe to still be in <span class="REGION">European territory</span>, and that's the place to have the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">That was all right because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was not yet in the war.</sentence><sentence id="120">This was in -- when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, that was in June, July 1940.</sentence><sentence id="121">So we didn't go to the war until December [1941], so it was all right for us to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, and that's where we were going to make our new <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> after the armistice to see whether there was any work that the JDC could do with the French-Jewish population, especially -- particularly the refugees, who were coming down there from the north and from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">Decided that there was work that the JDC could do, and I opened up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> for unoccupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: I want to backtrack a minute.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: Because I have a lot of questions.</sentence><sentence id="159">In 1939 and 1940 before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was occupied --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Where were your efforts directed?</sentence><sentence id="162">Where were the JDC -- were you sending money into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="164">Starting with 1933 with the advent of Hitler, we did not send any money into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="167">We had worked out an arrangement with the German Rifentrajung (ph) and the German Hoopsverine (ph), which were the agencies in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with which we worked, whereby they would collect to the extent that they could the cost of passage for people immigrating to the United</sentence><sentence id="169">States.</sentence><sentence id="170">They would collect them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marks</span>, and we would buy their steamship tickets for the dollars.</sentence><sentence id="171">Consequently our dollars did not go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but the counter-value of local currency, which was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was made available to the agency with which we operated.</sentence><sentence id="172">So if you ask if we sent money in, we did not.</sentence><sentence id="173">We operated that kind of a transaction.</sentence><sentence id="174">And when <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was over-- <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was the anschluss, we did the same thing with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">And in due course we even worked out by financial ledgerdomain to get money into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">We didn't send money into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> either.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: You went over with this purpose?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: No, I went over for the -- I didn't go over as a financier.</sentence><sentence id="191">I went over as a -- as a generalist, who happened to know something about finance, but that isn't why I went over.</sentence><sentence id="192">I went over, as I say, as a generalist.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: Is that what --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: You ask what did we do out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, since we were not in the war, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> was neutral, we could still communicate with any of the agencies with which we had formally been in contact with, by phone or mail or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="199">But of course, by mail we would not have tried to get in touch -- or any other way -- with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because anything that a name like Jewish, who would have been -- tripped us ___ in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and it wouldn't have gone through anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="200">And the same thing with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">But with the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> we could still work.</sentence><sentence id="202">There weren't many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> left where the Germans -- of course they occupied everything.</sentence><sentence id="203">So that while we were at liberty to do it, we were rather restricted in what we could do.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Now, being that you were in Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: You, I assume, had a lot more information about what was already happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> than the people back in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: The curious thing is this: People thought that since I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> -- back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> in 1943 -- that we knew all about what was going on with the stories that were coming out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, which later became known.</sentence><sentence id="211">We did not -- I did not know that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">We</sentence><sentence id="214">didn't have that information.</sentence><sentence id="215">The information that was coming out on that was being sent out by Riegner from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, and it got over to the State Department through the help of the American Mission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">And they suppressed it, because they said they wanted proof that the stories that were coming out were accurate, and they were going to hold up the information until they got that proof.</sentence><sentence id="217">Well, as you know, it took months before the story finally was released what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="218">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>, we didn't know it, because the Portuguese papers certainly didn't carry it.</sentence><sentence id="219">They didn't know it either.</sentence><sentence id="220">They had no reporters running around loose, going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="221">So we didn't know it.</sentence><sentence id="222">And only Riegner's reports brought the information out, and they were suppressed.</sentence><sentence id="223">So the information wasn't generally known.</sentence><sentence id="224">So we worked then.</sentence><sentence id="225">We stayed in contact, which was all right until December 1941, when -- everything got stopped off when we entered the war, and then we were fighting with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and with <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and the Italians came in in June 1941.</sentence><sentence id="226">And so we couldn't communicate with them and so on.</sentence><sentence id="227">We had to find other ways then for remaining in contact and communicating with them.</sentence><sentence id="228">We got in touch with a man in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">You may have heard his name, Soudymiah (ph).</sentence><sentence id="230">His name keeps coming up.</sentence><sentence id="231">He lived in up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St.Gallen</span> in <span class="REGION">North Switzerland</span>, who was president of the central Swiss welfare, Jewish welfare organization.</sentence><sentence id="232">And he agreed temporarily to act for the JDC in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">He finally gave up that position with the Swiss agency in order to devote all his time to JDC.</sentence><sentence id="234">So he became JDC's representative in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">And it turned out that he was our delegate for all these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which the JDC itself as an American organization could not come in contact, which meant that he was in contact with <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, with <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, and even with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span>, with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, occupied, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="236">And he did the things for us.</sentence><sentence id="237">Communication with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soudymiah</span> was easy enough by telephone.</sentence><sentence id="238">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> you could talk back and forth -- you could talk to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">That was all right.</sentence><sentence id="240">You just had to be careful about routing the telephone calls, because if they crossed -- going to cross <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, that was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">Do it by___; they were more liberal.</sentence><sentence id="242">And you could make your telephone calls that way, and even send mail that way in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">So that's how we kept in touch, then, with the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> with which the JDC -- which the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ultimately was in war with.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: When you were in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> in, I guess, 1939, 1940?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: I went there --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Were the refugees there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Yeah, sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: What was that operation about?</sentence><sentence id="290">What did you do there?</sentence><sentence id="291">Tell me more about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

where there -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, where they needed a quasi-religious functionary to run the services.</sentence><sentence id="1085">But the JDC provided funds.</sentence><sentence id="1086">You probably heard a story from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tetfear</span> (ph) about a mikvah.</sentence><sentence id="1087">There was a question of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mikvah,</span> which came up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vohrenwald</span>, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="1088">A very well known, world known, Jewish rabbi ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span>, and he insisted on having a mikvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vohrenwald</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1089">There was one, but it wasn't kosher enough.</sentence><sentence id="1090">He wanted to make his own.</sentence><sentence id="1091">All right.</sentence><sentence id="1092">So finally a mikvah was built for him by the JDC, but then there was the question of water.</sentence><sentence id="1093">You know the water has to be rain water, pure -- it's all described in the Talmud about the water.</sentence><sentence id="1094">There was no such water.</sentence><sentence id="1095">JDC staff member in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vohrenwald</span>, he went up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and brought back a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of snow and melted</sentence><sentence id="1097">1 the snow, and the snow was pure, that was fit for the mikvah.</sentence><sentence id="1098">So the rabbi had his mikvah and the water, because our guy went up into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and brought snow back, but it was pure water.</sentence><sentence id="1099">You had to do that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1100">And then in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> themselves there was a business -- we had to start <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> classes.</sentence><sentence id="1101">We imported staff from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to do that sort of thing with <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> classes and do things for adults, who might have forgotten about their Jewish backgrounds and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1102">We didn't get very much money for the rebuilding of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1103">We felt that that was a responsibility of other people to do, and we weren't so anxious to put funds into bricks and mortar when people didn't have [enough] to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1104">You couldn't feed them bricks and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1105">And so we didn't do too much of that.</sentence><sentence id="1106">But where something was mobile, anything that a person could carry with them, that, we were interested in doing.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Health, they could carry with them; education, they could carry with them; vocational training, he could carry with them -- good for the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="1108">But we didn't involve ourselves particularly in the rehabilitating of the <span class="DLF">graveyards</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1109">You can't take that with you.</sentence><sentence id="1110">And while it may have a great deal of religious significance, other people could do that.</sentence><sentence id="1111">Family members or people from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or something could do that.</sentence><sentence id="1112">We had other things to do with our funds.</sentence><sentence id="1113">And so then I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, then, for a year with our program there.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and undertook other functions there.</sentence><sentence id="1115">For awhile I filled in a blank in the immigration department of the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="1116">The immigration, that was really a tough business, because -- as you have heard -- everybody wanted to get out.</sentence><sentence id="1117">And you had people in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>; <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1118">They were all to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to wait in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> until they could get their visas.</sentence><sentence id="1119">And you know the difficulties which existed in getting visas.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Nobody would let people in.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Even to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, visas were issued in the order of priority of your registration.</sentence><sentence id="1122">And according to priorities in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, you could have waited for eight years or ten years before you had ____, because it was all done on a quota basis.</sentence><sentence id="1123">So everybody wanted to come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1124"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> got all clogged up with refugees who were sitting around.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Of course, we had to maintain them.</sentence><sentence id="1126">What were they going to live on?</sentence><sentence id="1127">We had to maintain them while there were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And so we had to arrange for them to be held back in the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> from whence they came and sent messages back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> not to let people come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> until they</sentence><sentence id="1130">2 are called forward by us.</sentence><sentence id="1131">Called forward meant that there's transportation, there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1132">At that time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were all clogged up.</sentence><sentence id="1133">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger boats</span> going between Europe and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at that ttme.</sentence><sentence id="1134">When I say "no," sure, there were -- every once in a while there would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1135">And there was a great deal of competition to get on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136">So there were so many <span class="NPIP">places</span> that we could get.</sentence><sentence id="1137">So we had to tell people -- keep them back where they are, keep them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, because the authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were after us, to keep the influx down.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And so they had to stay back.</sentence><sentence id="1139">On one occasion we had to take a whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, the Shohan Newbit (ph), to send that to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1140">There were so many Australian visa holders that we had to put them all on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and send the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> down to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> to get them down there.</sentence><sentence id="1141">And so we were in the immigration business starting -- as I told you -- until 1954.</sentence><sentence id="1142">And in 1954, a couple of the agencies that were involved with immigration merged, which included the JDC too.</sentence><sentence id="1143">So that took us out of the immigration business and this merged organization, of which the JDC was the principal anyhow -- at least took it out of our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and took the responsibility away from us.</sentence><sentence id="1144">Another operation that we had was the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation.</sentence><sentence id="1145">The foundation was established during the wars to help in the establishment of moon (ph) cooperatives for poor people -- or people who couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1146"><span class="BUILDING">Banks</span> wouldn't necessarily lend to Jews or the interest rates were so exorbitant.</sentence><sentence id="1147">So we provided capital, got the local people to provide capital, and these <span class="BUILDING">cooperative banks</span> were established by the American Joint Reconstruction Foundation, which were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, all over <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>, had these foundations.</sentence><sentence id="1148">And then of course, there were people who couldn't even pay the low interest rate that was being charged by these <span class="BUILDING">local banks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1149">So we opened up free loan societies and provided the capital for that.</sentence><sentence id="1150">As I said before, anything that you touched, the JDC was in there somehow or other in trying to make life more livable, to bring people back to normal as quickly as possible and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1224">Q: Was the primary goal to bring people back to normal, to sustain them or to get them moved out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1226">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1228">Q: Which was the primary focus if there is one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1233">A: That's a difficult one.</sentence><sentence id="1234">I think it was more important to move people out, because they could be brought back to normal in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to which they were going.</sentence><sentence id="1235">And I would say if one had to make a choice, whether you bring people back to normal or move them out, move them out.</sentence><sentence id="1236">Although it was difficult to move them out if they weren't normal.</sentence><sentence id="1237">So which comes first, the chicken or the egg?</sentence><sentence id="1238">It's a difficult one to work on, but it was done.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1245">Q: When you arrived, when you were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erolson</span> (ph) --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1246">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1247">Q: -- overseeing that, did the situation you found yourself in, in terms of the numbers of refugees, numbers of people with great needs, did the situation seem overwhelming?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1249">A: I don't think that's a good term to use.</sentence><sentence id="1250">We knew that we had a big job.</sentence><sentence id="1251">If you're overwhelmed, you stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1252">We had a big job, but maybe the job got bigger.</sentence><sentence id="1253">And you had to do it, but you couldn't be overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="1254">Maybe you were underwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="1255">You certainly couldn't be overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="1256">The job might have been considered overwhelming.</sentence><sentence id="1257">I think there's a nuance between the job being overwhelming and being overwhelmed by it.</sentence><sentence id="1258">You know?</sentence><sentence id="1259">We weren't overwhelmed --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1260">Q: But the job was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1261">A: But the job was overwhelming.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1263">Q: Can you describe that a bit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1265">A: Look, the JDC had a job to do.</sentence><sentence id="1266">And there wasn't any question of weighing things, can we do it or can't we do it, do we have staff or don't we have staff, do we need that or don't we need that, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1267">You just dug in and did it.</sentence><sentence id="1268">Now, that sounds very simple, but to use a vernacular, we surrounded ourselves with a group of "can do" people, and they did.</sentence><sentence id="1269">We had to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1270">There was no choice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1277">Q: Was the situation something more than you had ever encountered before?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1279">A: Of course I'd never encountered it before.</sentence><sentence id="1280">Nobody had encountered in before.</sentence><sentence id="1281">This was the first time in history that you had a problem like this.</sentence><sentence id="1282">You certainly didn't learn how to handle it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1283">You certainly didn't learn it in the school of social work when the people were social</sentence><sentence id="1285">4 workers.</sentence><sentence id="1286">You talk with a social worker and you say listen, did your social work help?</sentence><sentence id="1287">They say it did not.</sentence><sentence id="1288">But again, we had people who were working for us who didn't come out of the <span class="DLF">social work field</span> at all; teachers, for example.</sentence><sentence id="1289">We had -- the man who ran our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> -- you know about the Cyprus business -- he was a school teacher.</sentence><sentence id="1290">He wasn't a social worker.</sentence><sentence id="1291">But he had social instincts.</sentence><sentence id="1292">So we knew what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1293">We didn't have the formal training, but he knew what to do, social work.</sentence><sentence id="1294">People were the way they were -- their characteristics.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1311">Q: Do --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1312">A: Well, I wonder whether I can take a time out to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">men's room</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1313">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1315">A: Where was this Joint successful?</sentence><sentence id="1316">I would say this: I think you have to look at it a little bit in terms of the times.</sentence><sentence id="1317">What had happened to the Jewish people in Europe was really so horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1318">As you think about it, it's incredible.</sentence><sentence id="1319">You can't even talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1320">How do you kill billions of people just like that?</sentence><sentence id="1321">And I think that stirred up a lot of the younger people and some of the older people too, who want to do something to try to -- not make amends, because we didn't do it -- but to try to do something to relieve their plight of people involved a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1322">And they were willing to put in their time and their energies to do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="1323">You had to have certain characteristics of the individual, I think, to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="1324">It had to be people who were interested in doing things for other people.</sentence><sentence id="1325">And when these stories got out as to what had happened, a decent feeling, decent thinking young guy would really want to do something to try to help straighten the world out a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1326">And so they were willing to devote part of their time at least to making a contribution to bettering the lot of some people atleast.</sentence><sentence id="1327">And____ concerns on trying that outlet in the JDC and going overseas and doing something about it.</sentence><sentence id="1328">And I think that probably motivated many people who came overseas to work with us, and I think that that accounts for the quality and level of work which they produced for JDC and contributed to our success.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And I think that the JDC could feel some satisfaction that it really did contribute something to Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="1330">Whether it's the fellow who landed back on his feet in Europe or immigrated <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>, I think we did a lot to help people.</sentence><sentence id="1331">They were in far away</sentence><sentence id="1333">5 <span class="NPIP">places</span>; <span class="REGION">South America</span> or elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1334">JDC followed them along and did what it could to give them some kind of break.</sentence><sentence id="1335">I think people are entitled to a break in life, and if you can do something to help them if they didn't have a break, I think you should.</sentence><sentence id="1336">And I think that motivated a lot of people to do what they did.</sentence><sentence id="1337">And I think that accounts for JDC's success.</sentence><sentence id="1338">And then when you add to that the personalities in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, the lay people, who were behind the JDC and the thought that they give to it, they're entitled to a lot of credit.</sentence><sentence id="1339">They helped create the atmosphere which makes people happy to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1340">And that's all one's asking, --S--------They only see what was undone. They see the <span class="DLF">hole</span>, they don't see the bricks. Every once in a while we sit back and we look at the bricks too, and you get a certain feeling of satisfaction out of doing it, doing something for somebody else, whatever. You don't get wealthy at it, but the satisfaction that you get remains with you. I think that the success that the JDC has had accounts for it. CONLUSION OF INTERVIEW .</sentence></p></dialogue>
