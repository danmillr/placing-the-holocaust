<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Can you tell us your name and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: My name is and they used to call us Willy or Wilek.</sentence><sentence id="3">Loew was L-O- W, but when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> it was changed to L-O-E-W. So the name actually here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is William Loew, but my friends back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they remember me as Wilek.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.855421" long="23.987601">Lemberg</span> is basically a German name for Louve and my parents came from probably <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">I'm not quite sure, but from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and we settled down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">That was <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> at the time and also known as a Austria Hungarian empire.</sentence><sentence id="8">The time in the when I was born I had basically a nice family, a wonderful family.</sentence><sentence id="9">Let me speak about my brothers.</sentence><sentence id="10">I had an older brother we used to call Eli.</sentence><sentence id="11">The oldest one was Abe.</sentence><sentence id="12">We had a very close family.</sentence><sentence id="13">My mother was very -- was a housewife but also dealing in business.</sentence><sentence id="14">Our business was we had a <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> a mead brewery which is a honey wine.</sentence><sentence id="15">The business was quite prosperous.</sentence><sentence id="16">For one thing, our <span class="BUILDING">business</span> has been derived from previous generations.</sentence><sentence id="17">We started, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870.</sentence><sentence id="18">As a matter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine.</sentence><sentence id="19">Our family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers from either <span class="NPIP">side</span>, my mother's and my father's side.</sentence><sentence id="20">We were more numerous on my father's side than on my mother's side.</sentence><sentence id="21">My mother's maiden name was Margulies and some of her brothers went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder stayed there in at that time.</sentence><sentence id="23">We stayed and we tried to continue our <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">My father died when I was four years old.</sentence><sentence id="25">He died probably 1929 so my mother actually took over the business.</sentence><sentence id="26">I don't think she was a good business woman from what I recall.</sentence><sentence id="27">The business continued.</sentence><sentence id="28">We had my oldest brother could not get into a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">So, he studied there.</sentence><sentence id="30">This was expensive to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> because the money that we had from the business was not that prosperous.</sentence><sentence id="31">I'm not quite sure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the business as she should be.</sentence><sentence id="32">So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and we were no longer in the business of honey wine.</sentence><sentence id="33">But my uncles they continued to be in business.</sentence><sentence id="34">At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that we know and also to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">The Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> was the best that can be said back in "37 "38 from what I can recall was lukewarm.</sentence><sentence id="36">It wasn't very bad.</sentence><sentence id="37">It wasn't very good.</sentence><sentence id="38">We did have our quotas going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a matter of fact when I went for my exam to enter the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> even though the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> was ten blocks away from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota.</sentence><sentence id="39">I passed I understand my entry exam, but I couldn't get in.</sentence><sentence id="40">That was back in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="41">So, in order to continue my studies I had to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> back on <span class="DLF">Louve on Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">It was known as the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">Going back to "38, "38 was a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet the loans that my father apparently incurred.</sentence><sentence id="44">So, things were difficult.</sentence><sentence id="45">My oldest brother Abe who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, he finished his master's degree and he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he .</sentence><sentence id="51">tried to stabilize, because he was basically the oldest in our family, he tried to stabilize the family.</sentence><sentence id="52">Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his own good.</sentence><sentence id="53">He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to love each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year old boys used to do.</sentence><sentence id="54">Abe on the other hand was much older that we were.</sentence><sentence id="55">He was older than I by ten years so he was more a serious person and he had very little in common with us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="56">In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were quite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> especially those Jews who were exiled from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and somehow they didn't stay long enough in the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they kept on moving and settled down in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">This was in "39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they came the German Jews in thousands and settled down in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: What year were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Did you work in the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: No, I did not.</sentence><sentence id="122">We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our enterprise, or the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span>, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="123">The only time I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> is to see the process of making wine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists in the winemakers.</sentence><sentence id="124">They were there, of course, I recall we had a <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> that took <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> a whole <span class="DLF">block</span> because that whole <span class="DLF">block</span> used to belong to us.</sentence><sentence id="125">Underneath in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> under the whole <span class="DLF">block</span> was the whole <span class="BUILDING">winery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">I recall that barrels where the wine was stored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high.</sentence><sentence id="127">They were smaller.</sentence><sentence id="128">They were not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but I recall they were maybe 35 gallons.</sentence><sentence id="129">This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey wine.</sentence><sentence id="130">I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma contributed from the honey it was still there.</sentence><sentence id="131">But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and I don't know who took over our business.</sentence><sentence id="132">It could have been that my uncles had took it over.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: You lost your father when you were four years old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Do you remember him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: Very little.</sentence><sentence id="152">There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old.</sentence><sentence id="153">He had a beautiful flag, eight or nine <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was designated for a certain purpose.</sentence><sentence id="154">Beside the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> we had what we used to call <span class="INT_SPACE">salon</span> which is a large area and we had a special <span class="BUILDING">reception place</span> for certain events or for our friends of the family.</sentence><sentence id="155">So, we had a fairly large flag.</sentence><sentence id="156">My grandfather who actually brought .</sentence><sentence id="162">me up because I lost my father when I was four, he used to live with us and my aunt Miriam she was a sister of my mother and we stayed together.</sentence><sentence id="163">That was my family, the immediate family.</sentence><sentence id="164">Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my aunt Miriam and my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="165">My grandfather brought me up.</sentence><sentence id="166">He was in a way a philosopher on his own.</sentence><sentence id="167">He was a self taught mathematician.</sentence><sentence id="168">He was a true philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="169">Not only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own mind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights.</sentence><sentence id="170">He would get up in the morning four o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">I knew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing.</sentence><sentence id="172">Whenever he woke up he would start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any coughing any more.</sentence><sentence id="173">So, he did traditional things with him.</sentence><sentence id="174">He would get up and go to our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">We used to call it a .</sentence><sentence id="176">He would stay there until from four to seven, seven thirty and by that time he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and wake us up and go and prepare ourselves to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">My grandfather, he was very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="178">He actually prepared me for my bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="179">He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of course other languages like Polish and Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="180">But his special language was Hebrew and German.</sentence><sentence id="181">By profession he was a printer.</sentence><sentence id="182">He came from which is south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister, but I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's side that they live in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">He had a good life what I recalled even though it was difficult from a national point of view, but it was close.</sentence><sentence id="186">We were one family.</sentence><sentence id="187">We had a good rapport and a good relationship with our uncles.</sentence><sentence id="188">The other <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> in that was right across our <span class="DLF">street</span> so we had a major <span class="DLF">industrial park</span> if you will of <span class="BUILDING">breweries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">It was the <span class="BUILDING">Isaac Brewery</span> and there was the <span class="BUILDING">Brewery</span> and then there was a <span class="BUILDING">Brewery</span> and we were all together in it.</sentence><sentence id="190">It was good.</sentence><sentence id="191">I recall the way we were distributing our wine to different <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and horses and we would be delivering wine so often.</sentence><sentence id="193">I used to like to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and every so often just to be together with the horses.</sentence><sentence id="194">So, the whole where we used to live, we used to live on which is a normal whole <span class="DLF">block</span> that compares with any <span class="DLF">block</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, it was all one <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">We were sort of like a corner <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was a three story corner <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that borders on and " That was the main <span class="DLF">road</span> in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles.</sentence><sentence id="196">The is sort of almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span>, an <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews used to live.</sentence><sentence id="197">It was a dominant <span class="REGION">area</span> for Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="198">It had many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">In all, the Jewish people used to congregate right there.</sentence><sentence id="200">I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but there are basically, it was the majority in .</sentence><sentence id="201">The minority in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles.</sentence><sentence id="202">There were more Ukrainians in our <span class="REGION">area</span> than there were Poles.</sentence><sentence id="203">This is not to say that this was typical for -In our <span class="REGION">area</span> it was typical.</sentence><sentence id="204">The main activity in was on Friday where all the peasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly.</sentence><sentence id="205">We had a farmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly Fridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce.</sentence><sentence id="206">The potatoes for winter time.</sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabbages</span>, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those farmers.</sentence><sentence id="208">Of course, we were doing also business at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="209">They were also .</sentence><sentence id="215">purchasing wine.</sentence><sentence id="216">It wasn't a trade off.</sentence><sentence id="217">It was just a matter you would be buying for a certain period of time.</sentence><sentence id="218">My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but for the groceries she would go to a special <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where it would specialize in Jewish food.</sentence><sentence id="219">It was a vibrant <span class="REGION">area</span> for Jews to live.</sentence><sentence id="220">It was very interesting and when the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's market</span> was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would see everything was depleted.</sentence><sentence id="221">The whole <span class="REGION">area</span> was quiet because Friday night we would be going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, so the <span class="REGION">area</span> was depleted.</sentence><sentence id="222">Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was still kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping.</sentence><sentence id="223">So the whole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much quieter.</sentence><sentence id="224">Although the Jewish life continued.</sentence><sentence id="225">When the life in those days and I'm saying "38 and "39 was quite active it was also troublesome.</sentence><sentence id="226">Because we wouldn't be completely free of any problems.</sentence><sentence id="227">Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="228">The rumors were obviously of what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what happened in some other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> although we knew very little of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> but there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that affected us automatically.</sentence><sentence id="229">There was a movement in Polish society to promote the anti-semitism.</sentence><sentence id="230">There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> and it was moving toward the end that we were worried.</sentence><sentence id="231">We didn't know whether we had to take any action.</sentence><sentence id="232">In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of saying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming.</sentence><sentence id="233">In 1939 it was a year that we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="234">I don't remember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where the was bombarded.</sentence><sentence id="235">All the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, one bomb hit our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">We were then in our <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, actually in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> was where the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> was, but we no longer had the <span class="BUILDING">winery</span> but we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">A bomb hit just a part of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, just a part of it, but it was -- the damage was done not directly to our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in general, but the <span class="DLF">staircase</span>, for example, which were <span class="DLF">concrete staircases</span>, were they were marked and there were some splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was damage in it already.</sentence><sentence id="238">When we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> we had some other friends and some people were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while that I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage.</sentence><sentence id="239">We didn't see any fire.</sentence><sentence id="240">Nothing was really down other than one <span class="NPIP">portion</span> was hit and there were some other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were attached to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we checked that and I remember my brother said well, there's not much damage to our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">So, that I recall that we were hit by a bomb.</sentence><sentence id="242">Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the beginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> and the Russians came in.</sentence><sentence id="243">This was a new era that we began.</sentence><sentence id="244">The Russians occupied the eastern part of and was part of that <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">I recall when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were rolling down from coming from and they were huge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and apparently they didn't have to fight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">If they were they were somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="247">So, there was no conquest to be bragged about.</sentence><sentence id="248">They kept on moving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not changed other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was in a few weeks that all the major <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were confiscated and we had a .</sentence><sentence id="254">new regime and so on.</sentence><sentence id="255">This was the <span class="REGION">Soviet territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">So that means that our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> no longer belonged to us.</sentence><sentence id="257">And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because this was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with money for the loans we had incurred some years ago.</sentence><sentence id="258">So, that was a relief in a way.</sentence><sentence id="259">The big question was how do you make a living.</sentence><sentence id="260">My mother didn't see how her facial with the army showed that she was concerned about those things.</sentence><sentence id="261">Eli was basically two years older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="262">He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to find himself, and he tried different approaches.</sentence><sentence id="263">He didn't feel like going to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">He never cared for that.</sentence><sentence id="265">My older brother Abe was concerned because he was one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the intelligencias for reasons that I don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="266">They would put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> which was on -- I recall that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> being called .</sentence><sentence id="267">Whether they were arrested or not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">During that period of time, 1939 and into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as Eli.</sentence><sentence id="269">I continued to study.</sentence><sentence id="270">I continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> until that time.</sentence><sentence id="271">The subjects my studies were now basically new.</sentence><sentence id="272">First of all since Jewish -- this was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span>, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language.</sentence><sentence id="273">That was a surprise.</sentence><sentence id="274">In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with the Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay.</sentence><sentence id="275">My mother also makes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language.</sentence><sentence id="276">She used to, back in "39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English.</sentence><sentence id="277">I was better in English than I was in French.</sentence><sentence id="278">That's how I picked up some of my English language.</sentence><sentence id="279">But in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> we picked up two more languages and I was quite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew alphabet.</sentence><sentence id="280">You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it.</sentence><sentence id="281">In the Russian language it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware of that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that we picked up two more languages.</sentence><sentence id="282">The life under the Russians don't have too many bad recollections other than that during that period of time more since <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided into two <span class="REGION">areas</span>, the <span class="REGION">German area</span> which is the <span class="DLF">line</span>, quite a few refugees were coming more so from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">Of course the Germans occupied the <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> so they were directly under the German authority.</sentence><sentence id="284">And Jews were fleeing from that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">I recall that in my <span class="BUILDING">class</span> in we received at least three German students one was from , one was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, two were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and one from .</sentence><sentence id="286">And there was another fellow who was also a student.</sentence><sentence id="287">He was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">I don't know he escaped probably from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, but not <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> per se.</sentence><sentence id="289">He was from the <span class="REGION">Bohemia part</span> that was occupied by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="290">He

was the whole family escaped <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so there were no problems with the family and they hardly spoke about any events that involved them.</sentence><sentence id="460">They were boys.</sentence><sentence id="461">They were my age.</sentence><sentence id="462">They were more interested in soccer games.</sentence><sentence id="463">They were more interested in learning the language, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the Germans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature.</sentence><sentence id="464">We were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="465">We knew the Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="466">We knew the laws.</sentence><sentence id="467">They were not that much involved.</sentence><sentence id="468">They didn't care about that.</sentence><sentence id="469">Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="470">We were not frightened to bring them into our way of life.</sentence><sentence id="471">They had their way of life.</sentence><sentence id="472">So, they did not mention anything of their event.</sentence><sentence id="473">The refugees who were coming in more and more from the <span class="REGION">western part</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, we felt that we better slowly but surely being overwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was just bad.</sentence><sentence id="474">They were claiming that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> are being established.</sentence><sentence id="475">they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on.</sentence><sentence id="476">We thought in because we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't have the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, but these were true persecutions they were telling us.</sentence><sentence id="477">We didn't understand what a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> means.</sentence><sentence id="478">It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that.</sentence><sentence id="479">It wasn't a part that he would accept that, it just wasn't acceptable.</sentence><sentence id="480">We didn't know what people would do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> let alone the <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span> and how do you so things people ignored that part.</sentence><sentence id="481">But as they were coming, more by thousands, the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> that we used to have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we have opened up, the <span class="INT_SPACE">salon</span> and the special <span class="INT_SPACE">section room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="482">We gave it up for them to dwell on it, to live in there.</sentence><sentence id="483">We had a large <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we offered them everything we had.</sentence><sentence id="484">They stayed with us.</sentence><sentence id="485">Some of them took to work.</sentence><sentence id="486">Some of them moved out on their own, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who came who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left some other people back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> wherever their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="487">There was quite a few from , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> from -- I don't recall the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="489">It was the Russians came in and they forced themselves into our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they basically took all of these refugees.</sentence><sentence id="490">That was traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major expulsion of the refugees from to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">And we befriended some people there, so we were not far away from the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">I run into that, and they put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and they were locked up over there.</sentence><sentence id="493">That's how they were going to transport them from to east to <span

they do wrong?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="497">These were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="498">They didn't kill them, but they put them away.</sentence><sentence id="499">We found out later that they were sent to and to different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">I never met them again.</sentence><sentence id="501">Life in continued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that was in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded

the Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't --when I saw we, I'm talking about the family.</sentence><sentence id="512">The family, my mother or my brothers and I was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us.</sentence><sentence id="513">We were concerned yet there wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate danger.</sentence><sentence id="514">Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be threatened by.</sentence><sentence id="515">As I mentioned before we lived in , which the majority of people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and Poles.</sentence><sentence id="516">We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a lot that the Germans are very threatening people.</sentence><sentence id="517">We soon found out that the first few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> after the German occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>, there were quite a few robberies and personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="518">Some of them were maybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out.</sentence><sentence id="519">It was very dangerous to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow the Jews to walk after certain hours, evening.</sentence><sentence id="521">That was maybe just as good, but the problem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main robberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began.</sentence><sentence id="522">It was the night first 1:00, then 2:00, then 3:00 in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="523">They would rush into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and if they couldn't find anything, they would destroy or maim people.</sentence><sentence id="524">Only during the night could you hear the night cries, the night help rescue, seeking help.</sentence><sentence id="525">This was horrible right during the night.</sentence><sentence id="526">We, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we were basically safe because on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> we had a tenant that used to live and apparently he was a .</sentence><sentence id="527">He was half German and half Polish, I think.</sentence><sentence id="528">They occupied that level and they actually controlled the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, not that he would help us directly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so we were basically protected.</sentence><sentence id="529">But you could hear at night the horrible screams being robbed and maimed and so on.</sentence><sentence id="530">It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better because every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point and I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the <span class="REGION">premises</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, where we used to live, and move into a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that was .</sentence><sentence id="531">To find a <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> and to move out, and we didn't have that much time.</sentence><sentence id="532">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, the paintings, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rugs</span> that we had, some of that Snyder took in his possession.</sentence><sentence id="533">He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them.</sentence><sentence id="534">All the beautiful paintings my father bought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and the rugs.</sentence><sentence id="535">It's immaterial now, but at that time it meant a lot to us.</sentence><sentence id="536">So, we moved out with a basic one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> and some of the belongings that we had from the whole <span class="BUILDING">flat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="537">It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there.</sentence><sentence id="538">My oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us.</sentence><sentence id="539">He was taken away just before we moved out to that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">He apparently went to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to get some medicine.</sentence><sentence id="541">He never came back.</sentence><sentence id="542">He had to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> to where later on it became the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">It seems to me it was close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="544">He went there and he never came back.</sentence><sentence id="545">We didn't know what happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="546">We heard that later on one <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="547">They took them away.</sentence><sentence id="548">I'm not quite sure when was established.wasn't even at that time a bad word.</sentence><sentence id="549">But we heard .</sentence><sentence id="550">is an <span class="REGION">area</span> where Jews were killed and it was adjacent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="551">But we heard that word .</sentence><sentence id="552">So, he was not with us.</sentence><sentence id="553">Eli was in and out of our <span class="REGION">area</span>, .</sentence><sentence id="559">our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="560">Not quite sure what he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="561">I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to find some <span class="NPIP">angles</span> to get out of a bad situation.</sentence><sentence id="562">We moved out to that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">A secretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in a free standing <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she offered her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="564">I don't know the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an <span class="REGION">area</span> because you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one <span class="REGION">area</span> to another <span class="REGION">area</span> where you have a comparable exchange of <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="565">It wa questionable, but we had it.</sentence><sentence id="566">With our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in that free standing <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I recall there were maybe three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> perhaps and there was another family that moved in with us.</sentence><sentence id="567">Now, it was a period of time that we acclimated ourselves into this new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="568">The faces that we didn't know before all of a sudden we knew them very well.</sentence><sentence id="569">They were all Jews.</sentence><sentence id="570">The way I understand that a Jewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="571">We were not much concerned with them, other than there was another <span class="REGION">area</span> that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to us.</sentence><sentence id="572">We all of a sudden have a new life in a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, new people, new surroundings.</sentence><sentence id="573">The future, who knows what it's going to bring.</sentence><sentence id="574">The rumors were actually in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you better have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that will help you survive.</sentence><sentence id="575">Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the point where you had to survive somehow not knowing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or anything of that that we are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives.</sentence><sentence id="576">That didn't grasp yet.</sentence><sentence id="577">We weren't involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="578">We were involved mostly in our personal belonging, in our personal lifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a human being.</sentence><sentence id="579">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> didn't mean to us that this was the end of our <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="580">It was perhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="581">You were not directly confronted with the physical abuse, the physical maiming of people.</sentence><sentence id="582">The rumors were you better get work.</sentence><sentence id="583">That was in "41.</sentence><sentence id="584">I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work.</sentence><sentence id="585">Where do you find work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I run across a friend of mine who told me that there is a place on <span class="DLF">Street</span> who -- and they called it that they're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough.</sentence><sentence id="586">I didn't know what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into.</sentence><sentence id="587">I went back to my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for some workers and whether she would allow me to go interview.</sentence><sentence id="588">My mother didn't think that she objected other than she warned me be careful.</sentence><sentence id="589">I went there.</sentence><sentence id="590">I went to .</sentence><sentence id="591">They called it later on .</sentence><sentence id="592">isa <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that made tar paper for the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> and the way they were doing is you roll out a three foot section of paper and you dunk it into asphalt.</sentence><sentence id="593">Later you roll it out and there are some people who were using dry sand and covering the wet asphalt and that becomes a tar paper.</sentence><sentence id="594">What they were looking for workers who could carry balls of paper 75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span>, say from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> that they had right in the back, or <span class="NPIP">storage place</span>, and I wasn't sure that I could do that, but if that meant to have an i.d.</sentence><sentence id="595">and be protected I better do it.</sentence><sentence id="596">I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and told them that I would like this work if they could have me.</sentence><sentence id="597">There was man called Fessel.</sentence><sentence id="598">He was a Jew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slazia</span>, it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and he looked at me and close to him there was a foreman, a Polish foreman.</sentence><sentence id="599">I forget his name and he asked me can you use this young fellow and .</sentence><sentence id="605">he says yes I can only if he can carry that ball.</sentence><sentence id="606">He took me out and tested me out, and he selected the largest ball, 75 kilos.</sentence><sentence id="607">Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I carried it and I dropped it the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="608">You can work with us.</sentence><sentence id="609">It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that I'm employable.</sentence><sentence id="610">I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be more secure.</sentence><sentence id="611">From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working every day with them going back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to or .It's maybe a 20 minute walk, maybe 30 minutes.</sentence><sentence id="612">So, at that time, I was going back and forth and my mother all day long I would be working and evening I would be coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="613">At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the place I used to work, like tomatoes and maybe bread although we could buy some bread but we were rationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="614">So, it was helpful.</sentence><sentence id="615">I don't recall at what point they have established <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="616">It was some time later than -- I'm trying to recall something which I'm not quite at ease with me.</sentence><sentence id="617">Let me say the time sometime in August of 19-- it was in "42 already.</sentence><sentence id="618">I did work a number of months.</sentence><sentence id="619">It seems to me going back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I cannot recall.</sentence><sentence id="620">The image that comes to my mind now is August the action.</sentence><sentence id="621">We called it , where that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in was basically almost evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="622">Practically all the Jews were taken and I was at that time in " was located on <span class="DLF">Z6tkiewska Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">The main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> was from which was the main thorough between north and south.</sentence><sentence id="624">And it was the <span class="REGION">area</span> which would be within a couple blocks of where my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> used to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's it used to be and so on.</sentence><sentence id="625">There was a time I recall when the action came about in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and it was close to evening.</sentence><sentence id="626">Somebody rushed into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> one of our workers.</sentence><sentence id="627">They were moving them out to the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="628">We moved out, I moved out immediately to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> to see what we wanted to see.</sentence><sentence id="629">We saw what we didn't want to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto people were moving and going to <span class="DLF">Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="630">I looked and I saw some of my friends.</sentence><sentence id="631">My friends, dear friends that I used to play with.</sentence><sentence id="632">Some acquaintances.</sentence><sentence id="633">I was looking for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="634">I didn't see her, didn't find her.</sentence><sentence id="635">It was maybe twenty rows and miles of people.</sentence><sentence id="636">They were slowly marching.</sentence><sentence id="637">They were guarded by Ukrainian .</sentence><sentence id="638">I didn't see any Germans.</sentence><sentence id="639">Maybe in the back, but I didn't see them.</sentence><sentence id="640">Mostly Ukrainian on each <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="641">I didn't see the front either.</sentence><sentence id="642">I came right in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="643">I didn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see the end of the march.</sentence><sentence id="644">I just kept on seeing the <span class="REGION">area</span> where it was visible to me from that narrow <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="645">They didn't see me.</sentence><sentence id="646">I saw them because the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was actually locked, the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="647">It was going on for hours and hours because there was a slow march.</sentence><sentence id="648">Finally it ended.</sentence><sentence id="649">People were looking from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> because all was inhabited by Ukrainians and Poles, second third stories, they're all looking at them.</sentence><sentence id="650">It was a very grim sight.</sentence><sentence id="651">I don't recall -- it was the following day that I decided to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="652">Although they warned me not to go, they I mean Fessel and the director of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="653">At that point in time I did already have my i.d.,</sentence><sentence id="654">the identification card.</sentence><sentence id="655">I don't recall whether I had to wear a band or not.</sentence><sentence id="656">I probably did, but I don't recall that.</sentence><sentence id="657">But I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because I wanted to see what happened to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="658">I rushed into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="659">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was empty but the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> where we had the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for my mother was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="660">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> consisted of a frame and on top of the frame there was this soft part which is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="661">You couldn't .</sentence><sentence id="667">0 tell whether that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> was separate for anyone else it was one <span class="NPIP">part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="668">The frame and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span>, the upper part was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="669">That's why when there was any action, my mother would be hiding there.</sentence><sentence id="670">I would make sure of that.</sentence><sentence id="671">When I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the <span class="REGION">upper part</span> was moved so I was scared of that.</sentence><sentence id="672">When I cried out for my mother she came to life.</sentence><sentence id="673">She was there.</sentence><sentence id="674">She was on the inside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> so even it was moved, she was in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">She was wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket.</sentence><sentence id="676">So even though they were looking for her, they didn't find her.</sentence><sentence id="677">She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="678">A number of weeks went by before another action came about.</sentence><sentence id="679">I think during that action I lost my mother, and I don't know how they got her.</sentence><sentence id="680">So, she was gone.</sentence><sentence id="681">Eli was gone, Abe was gone.</sentence><sentence id="682">It was a part of that they have then decided to establish a <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>, I think, on the premises of

was more of a family son.</sentence><sentence id="905">I was closer to my mother and assuring that everything was under control and Eli was not the opposite of me and he wasn't completely with me as I would like him to be.</sentence><sentence id="906"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Abe</span> was completely different.</sentence><sentence id="907">He was much older than we were.</sentence><sentence id="908">He was ten years older.</sentence><sentence id="909">He had his own friends.</sentence><sentence id="910">He had very little to do with us.</sentence><sentence id="911">He would want to talk to me other than in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="912">He despised Polish language, so he would only speak Hebrew to me, and I had to respond to him also in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="913">Although my Hebrew wasn't that good, but I carried on a conversation with him.</sentence><sentence id="914">It was something that I wanted to impress my brother Abe at one point in time there was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or Rumanian king that abdicated sometime in 1938 and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="915">I don't know whether he responded to me, but this was the time I recall an event that I tried</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="922">1 to impress and I wanted his assurance.</sentence><sentence id="923">Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because he was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="924">He tried to settle all the world's affairs.</sentence><sentence id="925">Eli was completely different from both of us.</sentence><sentence id="926">He was more or like a happy go lucky fellow.</sentence><sentence id="927">He wanted to live now not tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="928">Now is the day.</sentence><sentence id="929">Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and sell it to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him.</sentence><sentence id="930">I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to preserve things that the family had.</sentence><sentence id="931">He understood that very well, but he was my favorite brother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used to give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we would be smoking.</sentence><sentence id="932">So, I kept things in secret.</sentence><sentence id="933">He was very good natured, though.</sentence><sentence id="934">He cared about us.</sentence><sentence id="935">Now, Eli was taken away from us some time.</sentence><sentence id="936">I really don't know when.</sentence><sentence id="937">He was taken away from that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="938">Now I heard that Eli was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="939">We weren't sure that this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>, but it was very</sentence></p><p><sentence id="940">fearsome <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be in.</sentence><sentence id="941">The fact that we heard that and people are being killed there.</sentence><sentence id="942">Even though that I heard that Eli is there, I felt always that when Eli is ina tight <span class="NPIP">spot</span> he always will get out.</sentence><sentence id="943">At least I hoped so.</sentence><sentence id="944">When established the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>, I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="945">We were a crew of 40 Jews only men.</sentence><sentence id="946">It was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we felt was a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> at least for the time being.</sentence><sentence id="947">Even it was safe place that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined with each other than others.</sentence><sentence id="948">Probably psychologists would love to study those groups.</sentence><sentence id="949">I was basically with a group of boys my age.</sentence><sentence id="950">The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do we get some cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="951">That was the main thing at that time.</sentence><sentence id="952">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was gone.</sentence><sentence id="953">There was nothing that I can do any more in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">I didn't want to go anymore there.</sentence><sentence id="955">As a matter of fact it was a Jew free area.</sentence><sentence id="956">The only thing that was dominant was actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown ghetto</span> on <span class="DLF">Street and Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="957">That was the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="958">I did not know too much about things that surrounded us because we were confined in a given <span class="REGION">area</span> and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in.</sentence><sentence id="959">Even papers didn't come in.</sentence><sentence id="960">We didn't have any papers.</sentence><sentence id="961">So, the 40 Jews, even though we were together, they had such secrets.</sentence><sentence id="962">I didn't know what the secrets were.</sentence><sentence id="963">I learned later on apparently they built an extra <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="964">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where we used to live.</sentence><sentence id="965">On top there was the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> and in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> they erected a <span class="DLF">wall</span> which was done sometime probably before the action in August.</sentence><sentence id="966">I didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="967">Nobody let me know that.</sentence><sentence id="968">So, a lot of things -- in a way I was a little angry that they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="969">It was a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="970">It was a whole <span class="DLF">wall</span> and in that false <span class="DLF">wall</span>, false partition, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00 they would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="971">Even at that time I didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="972">I found that out later.</sentence><sentence id="973">When I was living in time where maybe I was too ambivalent, to naive of knowing what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="974">But, they were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="975">Families of some of these 40 people and when I learned later on that there is a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and I just hoped that Eli would be alive so I could bring him here.</sentence><sentence id="976">My work at that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> consisted of working first with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bales</span>, carrying the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bales</span> and sometimes just dusting the asphalt with the dry sand.</sentence><sentence id="977">But then later on since I liked so much horses, we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> there with horses that we would transport asphalt into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="978">There was one fellow who was we used to call the foreman.</sentence><sentence id="979">He took care of the horses and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and he would transport the goods, certain asphalt and some of them he would bring also</sentence></p><p><sentence id="982">It has</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="985">the interview.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="987">Information about access

id="990">His name was .</sentence><sentence id="991">And he selected me to be his helper to care for the horses and so on.</sentence><sentence id="992">I really enjoyed that.</sentence><sentence id="993">I'd rather work with horses than work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="994">The foreman of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> liked also bunnies, rabbits.</sentence><sentence id="995">He had a cage of rabbits in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stall</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and he asked me to take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="996">So, I had the horses now and I had the rabbits and I used to take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="997">It was pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="998">I liked to work with animals and at the same time I was the helper of .</sentence><sentence id="999">Lused to call him .</sentence><sentence id="1000">He was a very nice fellow.</sentence><sentence id="1001">A very straightforward fellow.</sentence><sentence id="1002">He was Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="1003">He did not see me as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1004">I was Wilek to him and he was to me.</sentence><sentence id="1005">I didn't care that he was Ukrainian even though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed Jews and abused Jews and vice versa.</sentence><sentence id="1006">He saw me as Wilek, a fellow.</sentence><sentence id="1007">So, he was very nice to me, he was human.</sentence><sentence id="1008">We liked each other.</sentence><sentence id="1009">So, I was his assistant in doing anything that the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> needed, to take care of.</sentence><sentence id="1010">Caring for the animals but also transporting asphalt.</sentence><sentence id="1011">This was going on for a number of months.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Now, I had an opportunity to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with him and see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1013">Now, when I drove with him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the .</sentence><sentence id="1014">So, we used to drive oh maybe a kilometer or so to get the <span class="DLF">asphalt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1015">We had a <span class="BUILDING">refinery</span> not far from us within a kilometer or so.</sentence><sentence id="1016">And that <span class="BUILDING">refinery</span> there was an <span class="REGION">area</span> where there was a <span class="BUILDING">refinery</span>, there was also a <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> for animals.</sentence><sentence id="1017">In that <span class="BUILDING">refinery</span>, the bi product of the <span class="BUILDING">refinery</span> is asphalt and they would pour out the byproduct into an <span class="REGION">area</span>, a depleted area a narrow area not too deep and what we would be doing is we would be cutting them in blocks because they were solid and carry them on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and bring them back to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1021">It has</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1024">the interview.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1026">Information about

id="1029">A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and of course in the process of asphalt being liquified later on in huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> and that's how we get the process of that tar onto the paper.</sentence><sentence id="1030">That was my work in , working with day in and day out.</sentence><sentence id="1031">We were able to drive from our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to maybe two or three different <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and of course at that time Louve, that <span class="REGION">area</span> any way, was already Jew free.</sentence><sentence id="1032">There were no Jews there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1033">Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1034">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was basically very quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1035">It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall back in "38 and "39.</sentence><sentence id="1036">We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very much befriended.</sentence><sentence id="1037">We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these days they will take me away.</sentence><sentence id="1038">The discussion was how do I survive.</sentence><sentence id="1039">How do I get out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1040">I did not have good moves ahead of me.</sentence><sentence id="1041">I did not see too many visions, what is a good way of doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1042">In back of our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> there were <span class="DLF">tracks</span> and those <span class="DLF">tracks</span> you could see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to my mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and said hey, I'm one of you.</sentence><sentence id="1043">But it was just a dream.</sentence><sentence id="1044">Back with Peter, I told Peter what's a good way of surviving.</sentence><sentence id="1045">He didn't give me a good answer.</sentence><sentence id="1046">One day he came and told me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife.</sentence><sentence id="1047">I thanked him for the offer or his thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="1048">We had a farmer that would deliver some produce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours.</sentence><sentence id="1049">He looked me up in , and he told me that if you need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> come to us.</sentence><sentence id="1050">So, in that preparation I was very glad that he offered me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide because I was at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> back on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> a number of years ago, a number of times on my vacation.</sentence><sentence id="1051">He would take me in to .</sentence><sentence id="1052">He had great piergos, it's dumplings with good stuffing.</sentence><sentence id="1053">His wife used to make.</sentence><sentence id="1054">I used to ride on the horses with him and take care of his cows.</sentence><sentence id="1055">It was just fun for me to do that at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1056">So, he came back, and he looked me up and he offered me, I had hope.</sentence><sentence id="1057">There's a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="1058">I had a duffle bag, a leather duffle bag and I put in some of my clothing, some of my things for him to have it just in case I do get to escape and get to his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1059">So, at least I have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="1060">Meanwhile I was working with Peter.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Because I wasn't sure where his <span class="DLF">farm</span> was, I knew but I really didn't know where his <span class="DLF">farm</span> was, and one day, Peter looks at me and says Wilek come over here.</sentence><sentence id="1062">Do you see this lady?</sentence><sentence id="1063">There was a lady that was limping that was going to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1064">I said yes I see her.</sentence><sentence id="1065">I remember her.</sentence><sentence id="1066">I remember her well.</sentence><sentence id="1067">He told me that he delivered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> of potatoes there.</sentence><sentence id="1068">That was some time early part of 1943 that he delivered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> of potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1069">It was a custom to buy potatoes in huge quantities for winter time and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1070">That was the way we did that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1071">I asked him what makes him think that she's the one.</sentence><sentence id="1072">I mean how do I know.</sentence><sentence id="1073">I don't know but remember her and I'll give you an address that in case something happens here, you go there.</sentence><sentence id="1074">Because he felt at that time that the director Fessel is grooming her or grooming this <span class="NPIP">place</span> for him to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1075">I took this as a good omen and I felt maybe he's got something there.</sentence><sentence id="1076">It was a certain time within that period of time.</sentence><sentence id="1077">It was just before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> that it was in April sometime that I remember that two partisans -- a partisan is a person who's a guerrilla warrior.</sentence><sentence id="1078">They used to belong to a Polish underground, and they spoke to our leadership in to join their partisan group.</sentence><sentence id="1079">I'm not quite sure what transpired but I think our leadership rejected them.</sentence><sentence id="1080">They didn't trust them.</sentence><sentence id="1081">It was during that period of time that things are .</sentence><sentence id="1087">4 getting closer and closer of annihilation of the Jewish population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1088">We knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and we knew they were fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1089">We also knew that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown ghetto</span> is getting tighter and tighter.</sentence><sentence id="1090">Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, less and less because until that time you see a group escorted by the militia.</sentence><sentence id="1091">People from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to work from work back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1092">Of course we were stationary.</sentence><sentence id="1093">The group of the 40 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1094">We were stationary.</sentence><sentence id="1095">We live right then and but we see them once in a while and sometimes I saw on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> these groups going back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="1096">I mentioned before this <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> and there was one Jew who used to work there and as we were cutting the asphalt and that Jew across the <span class="DLF">field</span> would look and wave to me and I would go there talk to him and ask him what his business was while he goes back and forth from the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1097">But at the same time, he offered me some meat to take it with me so I would bring that meat back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1098"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> meaning my people.</sentence><sentence id="1099">I would bring that.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Occasionally I would be going from to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> just to go there.</sentence><sentence id="1101">I didn't have anyone there.</sentence><sentence id="1102">Maybe I would be going with a friend of mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I wouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was for meaning that we were working for the , the army, even though that manager of our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was a captain in air force which doesn't make sense but that's the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="1103">He apparently was very good, very good.</sentence><sentence id="1104">A reasonable human being.</sentence><sentence id="1105">He had an excellent rapport with Fessel.</sentence><sentence id="1106">He was I think captain in the air force.</sentence><sentence id="1107">He was the one who would warn us when major problems occurred.</sentence><sentence id="1108">At one point, he would warn us that we were about to be picked up by the guards.</sentence><sentence id="1109">We would move out.</sentence><sentence id="1110">The way I dressed myself -- I was dressed myself as a typical farmer.</sentence><sentence id="1111">This is the way I could disguise myself the best, with long boots, with special boot type slacks.</sentence><sentence id="1112">They're specially curved that the boot accepts the slacks and with a hat and a cigarette in my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="1113">I used to roll my own cigarettes so I was a typical farmer.</sentence><sentence id="1114">The first time that we were going to be picked up I just left.</sentence><sentence id="1115">I had no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="1116"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was opened.</sentence><sentence id="1117">You could go in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but who wants to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1118">So I went downtown on <span class="DLF">Street</span> where I used to go with friends of mine and prominent the <span class="REGION">area</span> when we used to be young boys and free of troubles.</sentence><sentence id="1119">It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock, something right afternoon that I ran off from and there was very little you could do downtown other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who recognized me.</sentence><sentence id="1120">I was not, but my safe thing was to do was go to a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span>, so I went to a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> just to kill time.</sentence><sentence id="1121">After that time thinking just a few minutes ahead, what am I going to do next?</sentence><sentence id="1122">I didn't have the answer.</sentence><sentence id="1123">I had to do things that were natural in that point in time.</sentence><sentence id="1124">I saw a movie, another movie, it was newsreel of cutting.</sentence><sentence id="1125">This was where the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1126">The Russians claimed that the Germans killed them.</sentence><sentence id="1127">The Germans claim that the Russians killed them.</sentence><sentence id="1128">This was the time that Saw that excerpt.</sentence><sentence id="1129">I was all engrossed in that because for the first time I hear there was a cutting, there was a slaughter of Polish officers but from the <span class="REGION">German side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1130">After the movie, I went out and I don't know what time it was but I saw a column of Jews were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1131">I put my armband and I joined them.</sentence><sentence id="1132">That is the only place that I can go right now short of being right down <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> without Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1133">So, I joined them and I went over there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1134">There was probably a few weeks after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> or around that time.</sentence><sentence id="1135">I knew that I had to do something very drastic soon, but didn't have the opportunity yet.</sentence><sentence id="1136">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1137">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so crowded I .</sentence><sentence id="1143">5 did not feel so crowded in my life because that was the first time I was exposed to that.</sentence><sentence id="1144">In other words, living in in my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with only 40 Jews was a paradise from what I have seen over here.</sentence><sentence id="1145">People were living in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1146">Just a terrible situation.</sentence><sentence id="1147">No clothing, torn clothing, and a lady that I recognized who used to live on the same <span class="DLF">street</span>, she was a daughter of a grocer.</sentence><sentence id="1148">A very pretty young lady, she was probably in her 30s, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1149">She became a prostitute in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1150">But she took me in immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1151">She was my neighbor, and she gave me some slotties and I left went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an <span class="REGION">area</span> where some older young men were looking for how do you get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1152">How do you join the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1153">And I was right in the midst of it.</sentence><sentence id="1154">On suggestion was we get a whole group with the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that group all the way down all the way down because nobody is going to ask where are you going with this Jewish group.</sentence><sentence id="1155">That was one of the questions.</sentence><sentence id="1156">The other question is where do you the uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="1157">Where do you get the arms, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1158">It was a round robin exercise, how to you survive yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1159">The following day I got word that we are safe.</sentence><sentence id="1160">In other words I could go back to and resume my work.</sentence><sentence id="1161">I went back.</sentence><sentence id="1162">I went back to and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong.</sentence><sentence id="1163">It's only time before things happen.</sentence><sentence id="1164">There was another major action sometime later, I forget when in "43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was there.</sentence><sentence id="1165">He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day someone else was going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> also because of action, rescuing someone.</sentence><sentence id="1166">I joined them.</sentence><sentence id="1167">I said I want to go with you.</sentence><sentence id="1168">I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just in case I catch him.</sentence><sentence id="1169">I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there was a lady there, an empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> basically and asked her about Eli.</sentence><sentence id="1170">She said he was here, but they picked him up.</sentence><sentence id="1171">I came too late.</sentence><sentence id="1172">I was downhearted.</sentence><sentence id="1173">There was a place that very few people should be going through this exercise.</sentence><sentence id="1174">As I was walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, there was one <span class="DLF">fence</span> there and I hear right on the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, people were praying with a loud voice.</sentence><sentence id="1175">During the action and I kept on walking because I had to get out of that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1176">They will pick me up but I was secure because I did have the armband and I had the W and I had the identification stamp.</sentence><sentence id="1177">I forget the stamp.</sentence><sentence id="1178">It was a swastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp which was the most recent stamp.</sentence><sentence id="1179">So I was safe.</sentence><sentence id="1180">I went through and I got the other people who went with me from and we made our <span class="DLF">exit</span> in a hurry.</sentence><sentence id="1181">At that time, I didn't see any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> anymore or any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1182">They finished the action for the moment so we took our <span class="DLF">exit</span> out.</sentence><sentence id="1183">I went back to .</sentence><sentence id="1184">Eli was gone.</sentence><sentence id="1185">They took him away.</sentence><sentence id="1186">So there was nothing I can do at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1187">He's gone.</sentence><sentence id="1188">The whole family is gone as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Now, a few months went by now and they were talking now about the liquidation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1190">I don't recall when they had liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> other than one point in time just prior that we were to be picked up they pronounced that Louve is Judenfrau, Jew free.</sentence><sentence id="1191">No Jews live anymore in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1192">Now, the more I'm thinking from there on, I'm thinking more and more about this lady, the limping lady.</sentence><sentence id="1193">Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly how to go there to get to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1194">There was sometime in the morning, I forget when.</sentence><sentence id="1195">It was a beautiful morning as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="1196">The sun was out, nice and chilly.</sentence><sentence id="1197">Whether it was September or October, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1198">It was sometime in the fall one day we were told that 1:00 we would be picked up.</sentence><sentence id="1199">Now, time was early in the morning, maybe eight, nine, ten.</sentence><sentence id="1200">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1201">I knew immediately that something is going on because Fessel .</sentence><sentence id="1207">6 and Horowitz they were all dressed up.</sentence><sentence id="1208">They're ready to move out.</sentence><sentence id="1209">They were not moving yet, but they were ready to move out.</sentence><sentence id="1210">I didn't even try to look down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> what is going on regardless even though you have a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, I wasn't about to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1211">I decided to go, to move because I didn't see any future in hiding in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1212">Sooner or later, probably sooner than later we were going to be discovered, so I didn't take this <span class="NPIP">place</span> as a safe one.</sentence><sentence id="1213">My point was is to get out.</sentence><sentence id="1214">The question when, that is within an hour or so.</sentence><sentence id="1215">I went to Peter.</sentence><sentence id="1216">I said goodbye to him and I moved out.</sentence><sentence id="1217">That was the last time I saw Peter.</sentence><sentence id="1218">He wished me luck and I went out.</sentence><sentence id="1219">I kept on walking.</sentence><sentence id="1220">I don't remember all the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that I went through, I just followed certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> and I went through a <span class="NPIP">place</span> a main thorough and right on the <span class="DLF">street</span> a friend of mine, well, not a friend but an acquaintance.</sentence><sentence id="1221">A fellow I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, Sayer his name was and he saw me.</sentence><sentence id="1222">He looks at me.</sentence><sentence id="1223">Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my question is is he going to betray me.</sentence><sentence id="1224">I didn't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1225">He grabbed me and we went to a <span class="DLF">gate</span>, to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I told him I need your help.</sentence><sentence id="1226">What do you need?</sentence><sentence id="1227">I said I need you to be here at a certain time, about three o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="1228">I don't know what time it was then but there was plenty of time.</sentence><sentence id="1229">I thought I'd need him to go to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to get my ticket because I had my farmer in mind.</sentence><sentence id="1230">But I was on my way to that lady.</sentence><sentence id="1231">Just in case I didn't get any results there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to help me out to buy a ticket, a train ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1232">I wasn't sure how to buy it.</sentence><sentence id="1233">I wasn't sure that part how to buy the ticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray me.</sentence><sentence id="1234">He said I'll be here at 3:00.</sentence><sentence id="1235">What else do you need.</sentence><sentence id="1236">I told him I didn't need anything other than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two.</sentence><sentence id="1237">I kept on walking.</sentence><sentence id="1238">I didn't think that I would be betrayed by Sawyer.</sentence><sentence id="1239">I didn't think so even though he was Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="1240">So, I kept on walking and I went to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1241">At first I didn't recognize the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he described me a certain <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but when I looked at those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, they all looked the same.</sentence><sentence id="1242">Across the <span class="DLF">field</span> there was <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where the Ukrainian militia used to live.</sentence><sentence id="1243">There was an <span class="REGION">area</span> where I felt well, you do or you don't.</sentence><sentence id="1244">I went to one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I asked -- her name was Maria, and I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, is Maria <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1245">The person says no Maria here.</sentence><sentence id="1246">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="1247">Then I went to another <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1248">It must have been one of those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> so I went to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1249">The next time and she opens the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1250">Maria was there.</sentence><sentence id="1251">Now, Maria doesn't know me.</sentence><sentence id="1252">I know Maria.</sentence><sentence id="1253">She was limping.</sentence><sentence id="1254">She was a good looking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1255">I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel.</sentence><sentence id="1256">She says no Fessel in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1257">I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his workers is here.</sentence><sentence id="1258">She says no Fessel is not here.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I said okay.</sentence><sentence id="1260">I took off.</sentence><sentence id="1261">Maybe I was misled.</sentence><sentence id="1262">I took this as a true sign I was misled my next option is to go to my farmer.</sentence><sentence id="1263">I kept on tracing my steps back, the same way and I was going to see Sawyer.</sentence><sentence id="1264">As I walked down I'd say a good half a mile down the <span class="DLF">road</span>, I hear some hollering behind me.</sentence><sentence id="1265">It was Maria with her limping legs was after me.</sentence><sentence id="1266">She was hollering for me to stop.</sentence><sentence id="1267">I finally stopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me.</sentence><sentence id="1268">You're so stupid and some other expletives.</sentence><sentence id="1269">Come back with me.</sentence><sentence id="1270">And probably I was stupid and she took me back and walked me right into this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where Fessel was.</sentence><sentence id="1271">Now, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name, how I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them.</sentence><sentence id="1272">Obviously true, Peter could find them.</sentence><sentence id="1273">This was their main concern.</sentence><sentence id="1274">They weren't concerned about me but about Peter.</sentence><sentence id="1275">Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk.</sentence><sentence id="1276">And Peter he was such a friend that he would never betray me.</sentence><sentence id="1277">So there was no concern.</sentence><sentence id="1278">I .</sentence><sentence id="1284">7 wasn't concerned, they were.</sentence><sentence id="1285">The group consisted of Fessel and his brother.</sentence><sentence id="1286">His brother was a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain.</sentence><sentence id="1287">He had a German overcoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow.</sentence><sentence id="1288">It was Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got in there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his personal secretary in .</sentence><sentence id="1289">So at least two people from our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, his brother which I never saw him before, his lady friend.</sentence><sentence id="1290">That lady friend was a sister of that other couple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he came about there.</sentence><sentence id="1291">Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria.</sentence><sentence id="1292">So we had like seven people there.</sentence><sentence id="1293">I think there was seven, I was the eighth one.</sentence><sentence id="1294">It was a time where they were concerned about their security because of Peter.</sentence><sentence id="1295">The question was whether or not they should send me back, back to <span class="NPIP">Peter's place</span> <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell him no one was there.</sentence><sentence id="1296">So, I could go and apparently go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to their <span class="NPIP">place</span> to secure their <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1297">It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put me in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number of miles to his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1298">They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was more of a friend of mine than of theirs.</sentence><sentence id="1299">They left it at that.</sentence><sentence id="1300">So, now I was not one of them, but at least I was in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the time being.</sentence><sentence id="1301">The <span class="REGION">area</span> we were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I think maybe it was another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but basically I was in the front in the large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was together with this hiding family.</sentence><sentence id="1302">We had a <span class="DLF">trap door</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> which was not in the <span class="NPIP">walking place</span> but in a <span class="INT_SPACE">crawling space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1303">We had a special <span class="REGION">area</span> that was covered with a rock in case something happens we all go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and hide ourself there.</sentence><sentence id="1304">We had our food.</sentence><sentence id="1305">Apparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently paying also Maria.</sentence><sentence id="1306">I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money.</sentence><sentence id="1307">I didn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either.</sentence><sentence id="1308">So, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel.</sentence><sentence id="1309">The other couple they also were from Louve, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names because they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort of in a group relationship, you were strangers.</sentence><sentence id="1310">Maybe you had one thing in common, we are all Jews and we want to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1311">There was one thing in common but different interests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing.</sentence><sentence id="1312">So, the dynamics of our group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations.</sentence><sentence id="1313">I could take part of some of them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group.</sentence><sentence id="1314">There was a point in time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> is being liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="1315">The rumors were also that the Russian army is moving toward <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="1316">They weren't talking about immediate occupation or immediate conquer of the <span class="REGION">territory</span> but it was close enough that you need to make a decision.</sentence><sentence id="1317">Whether to stay in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> or to move on.</sentence><sentence id="1318">I did not take any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1319">So that wasn't an option that would be denied to me.</sentence><sentence id="1320">The other option was whether or not to escape <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> all together.</sentence><sentence id="1321">There was a young couple who would be coming and in keeping in touch with us.</sentence><sentence id="1322">They had Gentile papers and they had excellent Gentile features and they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1323">They would know how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued.</sentence><sentence id="1324">Now the question was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1325">They .</sentence><sentence id="1331">8 weren't even talking about <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time at all.</sentence><sentence id="1332">The question was they're going to be moving out, should they take me with them.</sentence><sentence id="1333">I confronted that part with Fessel and I told Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I would like to be with them.</sentence><sentence id="1334">I could always stay here, but I want to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> in general.</sentence><sentence id="1335">This is a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1336">I don't want to be here, even in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1337">He said well, we'll have to see what our resources are.</sentence><sentence id="1338">We'll have to see if we can give you some papers.</sentence><sentence id="1339">He apparently was good enough to do that for me.</sentence><sentence id="1340">I was told that their plan is to escape ultimately to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span> to from to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mountains</span>, through <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1341">That's the plan.</sentence><sentence id="1342">I walked with them all the way.</sentence><sentence id="1343">I'll go with you anyplace you go.</sentence><sentence id="1344">I felt that I could be of help to them if they needed me.</sentence><sentence id="1345">The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it was in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and the stamps and the my name was .</sentence><sentence id="1346">I took the name of an acquaintance of mine from .</sentence><sentence id="1347">He was a very nice fellow and I thought he ought to have my name.</sentence><sentence id="1348">So, from there on, my name was from then on until my liberation.</sentence><sentence id="1349">My religion was catholic, and everything else was true on those papers.</sentence><sentence id="1350">My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my religion.</sentence><sentence id="1351">From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something very interesting happened that I recall.</sentence><sentence id="1352">You know when you are in hiding for so many months you don't know how to purchase things.</sentence><sentence id="1353">How to deal with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> although we are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, because now we have to move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louve</span>, buy a ticket, and these are small items but very crucial items.</sentence><sentence id="1354">Get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, buy a ticket, go into the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, buy a ticket and go to .</sentence><sentence id="1355">Finding the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and maybe a reservation for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or not.</sentence><sentence id="1356">That we did not know.</sentence><sentence id="1357">Maria was not about to buy any tickets for us, so they asked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, look around, see where the purchase ticket box is, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets.</sentence><sentence id="1358">Well, I went there.</sentence><sentence id="1359">One night they left me and I had to go from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> at night walking through the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the militia and there is a small <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1360">I got to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and I got to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and to see where I could buy tickets.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I went to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, bought a ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1362">On the way back to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> and to see the temperament and the environment we would be going through.</sentence><sentence id="1363">When I came back, all the inhabitants of our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> just in case to run in case they caught me and brought militia with me.</sentence><sentence id="1364">They were relieved.</sentence><sentence id="1365">I came back.</sentence><sentence id="1366">Gave them the report and they were ready to move on.</sentence><sentence id="1373">9 Tape #4</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1739">Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1741">A: I'm not quite sure.</sentence><sentence id="1742">I never asked her.</sentence><sentence id="1743">The only thing that I could stipulate was that she was prearranged prior to that.</sentence><sentence id="1744">The fact that I saw her one day in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> walking towards the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that means she was prearranged.</sentence><sentence id="1745">She was given I'm almost sure that she was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel.</sentence><sentence id="1746">I know other things that during my stay in the hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that was the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with Fessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always be the winner on that evening.</sentence><sentence id="1747">He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game was over, he would be coming out with money.</sentence><sentence id="1748">He knew about us obviously, so he was paid that way through winning in this game.</sentence><sentence id="1749">Other than that, I don't have any other facts, but Maria a person of no wealth.</sentence><sentence id="1750">She had this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she was with Usak who told me where she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what was the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of human compassion.</sentence><sentence id="1751">Maybe it was a combination of both.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1763">Q: Was this a very lonely time for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1765">A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active.</sentence><sentence id="1766">I was very active.</sentence><sentence id="1767">My mind was always going regardless what was going -- what surrounded me.</sentence><sentence id="1768">My question was to myself how do you get out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1769">I was fierce about it.</sentence><sentence id="1770">I was driven by that.</sentence><sentence id="1771">How do you get out and stay alive.</sentence><sentence id="1772">Because I felt that I had to say something later on.</sentence><sentence id="1773">Maybe this is why I'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had to say it, to say that part.</sentence><sentence id="1774">So lonely, no I wasn't lonely.</sentence><sentence id="1775">I was too dynamic to be lonely.</sentence><sentence id="1776">So, when they saw me coming back from that <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and they greeted me with enthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our things whatever I had.</sentence><sentence id="1777">I don't think I had anything with me.</sentence><sentence id="1778">I just had just my hat, my jacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go.</sentence><sentence id="1779">We went through the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, got our ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1780">There was a direct <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to .</sentence><sentence id="1781">It was all night.</sentence><sentence id="1782">We went through over night and the following day we were already in .</sentence><sentence id="1783">We were picked up by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">smugglers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1784">Now, let me back off just a bit.</sentence><sentence id="1785">That couple who used to come who had their connection from <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, brought the papers for all of us.</sentence><sentence id="1786">That couple that I forget their name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1787">All of us left, including the lady friend of Fessel's brother.</sentence><sentence id="1788">By the way, she was pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="1789">She was big and my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was walking and she was also determined to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1790">We were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and got picked up later on in by the smugglers who were previously arranged by this couple who gave us all the false papers.</sentence><sentence id="1791">We went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1792">I forgot this <span class="REGION">area</span> at the time where it was that they took us.</sentence><sentence id="1793">I remember that we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa.</sentence><sentence id="1794">We had a piece of bread and that evening or that night, we were going to move out of .</sentence><sentence id="1795">Because everything else was prearranged.</sentence><sentence id="1796">It was sometime December or it was early part of January.</sentence><sentence id="1797">I don't know that period of time.</sentence><sentence id="1798">It was 1944, January or 1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time.</sentence><sentence id="1799">I want to say that I am close right on .</sentence><sentence id="1805">0 the <span class="DLF">verge</span> between December and January.</sentence><sentence id="1806">It was very cold and we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> close to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra Mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1807">It was basically a <span class="DLF">ski resort</span> and we departed from there.</sentence><sentence id="1808">We picked up and we kept on walking.</sentence><sentence id="1809">It was an <span class="REGION">area</span> probably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police.</sentence><sentence id="1810">By the way, this <span class="REGION">area</span> was strictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police.</sentence><sentence id="1811">The smugglers were actually Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1812">I forget their name.</sentence><sentence id="1813">I forget even their faces but we got through and we kept on walking through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1814">The episode that I recall was walking in the snow.</sentence><sentence id="1815">It was so called and also the snow was very deep.</sentence><sentence id="1816">The surface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into a trap because you couldn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="1817">It was a very difficult walk.</sentence><sentence id="1818">Now, the lady who was pregnant she had a horrible time walking.</sentence><sentence id="1819">At least I had boots but I don't recall if she had boots.</sentence><sentence id="1820">So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her.</sentence><sentence id="1821">No one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph.</sentence><sentence id="1822">The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart problem.</sentence><sentence id="1823">He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that mode.</sentence><sentence id="1824">I was young.</sentence><sentence id="1825">I felt good.</sentence><sentence id="1826">I was strong and I tried to help her.</sentence><sentence id="1827">I did help her.</sentence><sentence id="1828">I kept on walking with her.</sentence><sentence id="1829">At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her

asked Usak to help her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they wouldn't survive the trip.</sentence><sentence id="1831">I couldn't leave her.</sentence><sentence id="1832">I had to walk with her and I walked her and a long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out.</sentence><sentence id="1833">Such a shame, but we survived.</sentence><sentence id="1834">We went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tatra mountains</span> and got into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1835">At least we were there.</sentence><sentence id="1836">We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us.</sentence><sentence id="1837">They took us into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified ourselves as refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so we were all Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1838">So, from this police area I think they took us into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1839">We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for.</sentence><sentence id="1840">I don't recall how long we stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="1841">There was another couple from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, independently they came in.</sentence><sentence id="1842">They were refugees.</sentence><sentence id="1843">One was a professor | think, a Polish professor with his wife, and some other people.</sentence><sentence id="1844">At that point they took a picture of us that [had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time later.</sentence><sentence id="1845">The object has to move from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> now to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and within a few days I think we were moved from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to another <span

the early part in January.</sentence><sentence id="1850">If I recall well, when I was already in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later part of January but not the early part.</sentence><sentence id="1851">We were brought in and and there was a Jewish couple that took us in for that evening.</sentence><sentence id="1852">It was a Friday I think and the reason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LA</span> is a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1853">It was very good, very tasty.</sentence><sentence id="1854">This was the first time I was exposed to it.</sentence><sentence id="1855">1 was very grateful for it.</sentence><sentence id="1856">The following few days from because we wanted to g into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and that was our goal because from there on Fessel had his plans.</sentence><sentence id="1857">I had my plans so once I got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> which we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> within a week or so.</sentence><sentence id="1858">I don't remember that period very well, but I remember that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and the question was we were not occupied at that time so we were free and I identified myself .</sentence><sentence id="1864">1 with the Polish organization with all there were different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span>, not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> but <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and you reported yourself that you are one of them.</sentence><sentence id="1865">Whether they helped us or not I don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="1866">It was immaterial to me.</sentence><sentence id="1867">What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a Polish refugee and to be on their books.</sentence><sentence id="1868">From there on it was just a matter of finding out your level of survival.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Where do you go from there.</sentence><sentence id="1870">The trigger point was the time when the Germans again invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1871">That was the trigger point, be on the run.</sentence><sentence id="1872">You had to run again, and where to you run.</sentence><sentence id="1873">By that time I had already met some people, not friends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1874">The same problem, where do you run.</sentence><sentence id="1875">One thought was to run to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1876">The way you could get to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> was through <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1877">The other thought was to run to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, means you had to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1878">Which <span class="DLF">route</span> do you explore.</sentence><sentence id="1879">You explore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other.</sentence><sentence id="1880">I felt to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> would be a good deal to do, but to go you had to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1881">That was bad.</sentence><sentence id="1882">A better way is to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1883">I had friends that became my friends that were in the underground movement and I joined them.</sentence><sentence id="1884">Some of these people were mostly Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1885">Some Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going to run somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1886">I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish underground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be comfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group.</sentence><sentence id="1887">Even that group, I have some Polish members.</sentence><sentence id="1888">I was in a <span

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, but this was a short trip and I came back.</sentence><sentence id="1893">One time I had to carry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about it.</sentence><sentence id="1894">I'm doing something about it.</sentence><sentence id="1895">Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers, false birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1896">Church papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1897">Not specifically for Polish refugees.</sentence><sentence id="1898">We were all saved so called.</sentence><sentence id="1899">The question now is how do you help out the Hungarian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1900">They needed the papers.</sentence><sentence id="1901">They did not have the flexibilities that we did have because we were right <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1902">There was a time that they were mostly almost confined to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">house

whenever there was a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, there was always a heart beat, an extra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking at the <span

some <span class="REGION">areas</span>, but this was in <span class="REGION">Gentile areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1910">I never lived with Jewish families, not in <span

examined and to be found that I had any problems with them being either question whether I was a Gentile or not.</sentence><sentence id="1912">As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday morning, and to be one of them.</sentence><sentence id="1913">It was that kind of life that we tried to provide papers to the Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1914"><span class="BUILDING">Papers</span>, birth certificates, status certificates and so

left and right, left and right, and they selected me.</sentence><sentence id="2293">I think it was a left position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back.</sentence><sentence id="2294">Took me back into my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2295">It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they look at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that | all of a sudden get to my mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2296">But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or not a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what my status was because I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="2297">One major event that I recall wa the hanging of five Polish prisoners who escaped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2298">When they were brought back, they took out the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to watch the hanging.</sentence><sentence id="2299">That was sometime probably in December.</sentence><sentence id="2300">It was awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the

feet.</sentence><sentence id="2315">They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me personally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2316">I always felt that I could survive.</sentence><sentence id="2317">There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I couldn't physically move things the
