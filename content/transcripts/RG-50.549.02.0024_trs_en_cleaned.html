And when he told them that he was going to go to German -- to -- sorry -- to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, they said, "Why don't you stay here?</sentence><sentence id="12">In the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>, you will be very safe, and they do need a horse dealer here.</sentence><sentence id="13">There are lots of farmers who are always in need of new horses.</sentence><sentence id="14">And also, there are some people that are interested in riding horses."</sentence><sentence id="15">Well, it appears that he allowed himself to be dissuaded from going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and remained.</sentence><sentence id="16">And obviously sent, shortly thereafter, for my mother and me.</sentence><sentence id="17">I, at that time, was two years old.</sentence><sentence id="18">So, the two of us came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and my recollections obviously are not too clear.</sentence><sentence id="19">With regard to my parents beliefs and opinions, I have a feeling that my mother in particular, felt German first, Jewish second.</sentence><sentence id="20">I think my father may have been a little bit more neutral in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">By the way, my mother came from a fairly Orthodox family.</sentence><sentence id="22">Her father went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> a lot and I don't know if they had a really, strictly <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, but they were fairly observant.</sentence><sentence id="23">My father's family, however, was not.</sentence><sentence id="24">I don't think they were either very religious or very much associated with a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or community, as such.</sentence><sentence id="25">I think they were more interested in their business and my grandfather, incidentally, also was in the same line of business -- my paternal grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="26">And interestingly, my mother's father was a cattle dealer, slash, farmer.</sentence><sentence id="27">I am not too sure how politically active or conscious they were, other than the threat of</sentence></p><p><sentence id="30">ontectnetonancedjusinetneey for tarher biormatieraboutfisestecion</sentence></p><p><sentence id="31"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0024 4 Nazism.</sentence><sentence id="32">But, other than that, I don't think they were involved in any party or political organizations.</sentence><sentence id="33">My father did serve in the German army in the first World War.</sentence><sentence id="34">I do not know in what capacity, but he was a soldier, I don't know what rank he ever -- if any, he achieved.</sentence><sentence id="35">In any case, my mother's family, just to complete the picture, consisted of her parents, a brother -- an older brother and sister, who incidentally, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in "37 or "38.</sentence><sentence id="36">The mother, having been left behind for good reasons, because they wanted to establish themselves first in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and therefore, the mother remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchau</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Badbuchau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">My father's family consisted of three brothers, two sisters and of course, my father.</sentence><sentence id="38">All of the former went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> also, in -- I assume it was in 1938, with the exception of one younger brother, who also went to the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">So, that is for background information on the family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">I --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="41">Q: What happened to the brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: Good question.</sentence><sentence id="43">The brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>, did not think that anything was going to happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="44">Incidentally, he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, and when my father did say to him -- his name was Ludwig, "Ludwig, things are getting tight.</sentence><sentence id="45">Don't you think you should go into hiding?"</sentence><sentence id="46">Ludwig had responded, "No, I'm going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, and I know that's where many of them are going and I'm sure I will be all right."</sentence><sentence id="47">Obviously, he was not all right, he was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">However, all the others, they lived and thrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>, <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">So, to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, we -- we settled in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">These very nice people by the name of Pagrach found us a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and incidentally, they almost become surrogate family to us.</sentence><sentence id="51">They found us a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> across the</sentence><sentence id="53">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 5 <span class="DLF">street</span> and I seemed to have really bonded with them, calling them Uncle Ohm -- Ohm and Tumter and Oma and Opa, in lieu of having any Omas or Opas around me.</sentence><sentence id="54">So, my father started his new life and seemed to do quite nicely, I think, from an economic point of view, we -- we were all right.</sentence><sentence id="55">My mother was and still is, a very gregarious woman and she quickly made friends.</sentence><sentence id="56">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Jewish community</span>, it seems that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span>, a lot of German Jews came over the <span class="DLF">border</span> and settled there.</sentence><sentence id="57">And my mother managed to make contact with some of them and she used to have her Saturday afternoon coffee klatches with them and seemed to be fairly content with her life, although I think living in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like that must have been a little bit frustrating to her.</sentence><sentence id="58">I really don't know if she was always very happy living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="78">Q: Was she a very cultivated person, who'd love music and <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and so on that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- city life would offer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="80">A: No, unfortunately she was not -- was not and is not.</sentence><sentence id="81">She was a very good looking, young woman and I think somewhat indulged in by both her father, as well as my father.</sentence><sentence id="82">She was more interested in being courted than perhaps going to <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span>, to concerts, to movies, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="83">She read.</sentence><sentence id="84">I don't know how much she read, but she read.</sentence><sentence id="85">I really don't know what her interests at that time were, other than to be able to set a nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and to entertain her friends.</sentence><sentence id="86">And my father was a very, very good provider, but he too did not seem to be very much connected with -- he was quiet with the community.</sentence><sentence id="87">He would go on Saturdays to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, which was the proper thing for everyone to do.</sentence><sentence id="88">He would play cards, I believe, perhaps once a week with some of, again, the German Jews.</sentence><sentence id="89">They</sentence><sentence id="91">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 6 led a fairly self-contained life and there was really not much culture in and around that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">And this is sort of the atmosphere I grew up in.</sentence><sentence id="93">I adored my mother.</sentence><sentence id="94">I was very much attached to her, to the point where I would be with her if I could have been with her, morning, noon and night.</sentence><sentence id="95">I was less attached to my father.</sentence><sentence id="96">I guess I admired my mother.</sentence><sentence id="97">She was a very good looking, always very well groomed, dressed lady and I must have been quite taken by that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: You were an only child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: And I'm interested in knowing if you would suppose that to be the case because by the time you were born, there was clear -- clearly ominous signs on the horizon?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="125">asked my mother once why it was that I was an only child and she said, "Well, the circumstances were not exactly propitious to have more children.</sentence><sentence id="126">And of course, obviously, it was -- it was a g -- inadvertently, it was a good decision, because | think it would have been very difficult for us to have found two <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> -- I mean, <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> for several children.</sentence><sentence id="127">I don't think I considered myself to be a very spoiled child, but I don't know, of course, that's not for me to judge.</sentence><sentence id="128">My mother was very, very strict, a fairly tough taskmaster or mistress and I was expected to obey and she -- in many ways she controlled me quite a bit, because if I were offered a cookie by a stranger, I would look and see if she would nod and say yes, you may take the cookie, or no you may not take the cookie.</sentence><sentence id="129">And expected to make my little curtsy when I shook hands with somebody and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="130">She -- She was strict, my dad was not.</sentence><sentence id="131">He was more -- I</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="135">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 7 think he was more loving, a little warmer than she.</sentence><sentence id="136">I -- It's very hard to recall the en -- really, the environment too much.</sentence><sentence id="137">It -- I think, in many ways, that I perhaps got more nurturing from my adopted family, the Pagrachs or more attention from the Pagrachs, than I might have gotten at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">It's very difficult to describe this so many, many years later.</sentence><sentence id="139">In any case --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Well, you know a thought occurs to me.</sentence><sentence id="141">It's interesting that your mother would seem to be perhaps a -- a little self centered and yet, when tested by life, she came through with such flying colors, of courage and fortitude and optimism, which is remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="142">I wonder if you think those strengths in both your parents really came through s -- a spiritual sense?</sentence><sentence id="143">A s -- Convictions that were deep in the background?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: I doubt it.</sentence><sentence id="145">I really, really doubt it, but I think your point is well taken.</sentence><sentence id="146">There was this sort of -- well, what?</sentence><sentence id="147">They were not -- They were not as warm or giving as I think they could have been.</sentence><sentence id="148">I don't know, but spiritual?</sentence><sentence id="149">I think it was a matter of, we have to survive, we want to survive and no further thoughts were given to it.</sentence><sentence id="150">It's very possible.</sentence><sentence id="151">In any event, I would say it was a -- a good childhood, it was nothing extraordinary.</sentence><sentence id="152">I -- I got what I think I should have gotten and what I needed and I had my little friends, who would come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and play with me.</sentence><sentence id="153">I read a lot, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and got very many books and I was encouraged to read.</sentence><sentence id="154">I think my mother read to me.</sentence><sentence id="155">My mother, incidentally played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and would play for me sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="156">But, I have no remembrances of either one of my parents ever playing with me, playing games or really doing very many so-called fun things.</sentence><sentence id="157">I've tried to -- to think if there were instances and</sentence><sentence id="159">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 8 the only instance I can remember where I was taken somewhere just for my pleasure, was some -- I guess you would call it a very fancy <span class="DLF">playground</span> in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">But then again, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span>, did not have many opportunities for very many activities, so we had to make our own.</sentence><sentence id="161">We certainly managed to do that and did it very, very well, I think.</sentence><sentence id="162">So life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> really went on with friends and this -- the Pagrachs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Now you had taken identity papers from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pagrachs</span> when you went into hiding.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="185">What was the purpose for doing that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: No, I did not take identity papers of the Pagrachs when I went into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="187">I got those papers after the war.</sentence><sentence id="188">After the war, the Pagrachs came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> to, they were in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="189">One sister perished, her name was Lien and I had the letter from the Red Cross in which they notified the family that Lien had died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">I got that letter from Lien's sister, whose name was Berta -- Bertha, and she also gave me other papers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: And those are the papers I also turned over to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="201">So, was she -- was she also a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="205">The Pagrachs, there was a brother and there were two sisters and they were all contemporaries of my parents.</sentence><sentence id="206">And the oldest sister came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and lived near us and as I said, I considered her truly an aunt and a member of the family and had a lot of fondness for her, and m -- when she came to -- we had her come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and when she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and couldn't live there any longer, we moved her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockville</span> and we looked after her there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="209">ontectnetonancedjusinetneey for tarher biormatieraboutfisestecion</sentence></p><p><sentence id="210"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0024 9</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Now, moving along, what I was interested in knowing how you -- how your father arranged the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and whether his ability to reward somebody financially had any role in that.</sentence><sentence id="212">O-Or whether people would be given help through the organized resistance.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mm-Hm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">Well, my father and -- arranged -- it was not done through an organized resistance.</sentence><sentence id="215">My father, because he knew very many farmers, had sort of, in a discreet way, tried to find who could he trust, who could he not trust and who could he contact and who could he not contact.</sentence><sentence id="216">And found -- And knew a farmer with whom he had been doing business and had sort of dropped a hint, saying, you know, things are getting tough for us and when push comes to shove, I think we -- we probably have to try and hide ourselves rather than report.</sentence><sentence id="217">And this man, whose name was Yolink and this figures very prominently in my survival, said, "Well, I have these --," I think they were cousins of his and they were sh -- teachers.</sentence><sentence id="218">And he said, "They are involved in the underground movement, or in the resistance movement and why don't you talk to them, because I think they may know some people.</sentence><sentence id="219">But," he said, "I, myself, would be more than happy to take you."</sentence><sentence id="220">And, so that was arranged, that my father would meet those two ladies.</sentence><sentence id="221">And they -- And they'd had probably a number of addresses, one -- two of whom were the people where we ended up being in contact with.</sentence><sentence id="222">But, above all, Mr. Yolink said to my father, "I would be happy to kee-keep you, but not your wife and child, because I can only take one person."</sentence><sentence id="223">And that's how we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yolink</span> and then my father learned about the other families, but did not meet them at all.</sentence><sentence id="224">It was just a name -- two names that</sentence><sentence id="226">ontectnetonancedjusinetneey for tarher biormatieraboutfisestecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 10 were given to him.</sentence><sentence id="227">And one of the families had said they would take me and the other family said they'd take my mother and her mother, my grandmother, who, remember I said, had been left behind in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and came to live with us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="246">Why do you think these people did this and put their lives on the <span class="DLF">line</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: I think these people are -- first of all, they were -- especially the Hartamings where we stayed, were very deeply religious, they were Dutch Reformed and the Yolinks were also Dutch Reformed, perhaps a tad less religious than the Hartamings were.</sentence><sentence id="250">I think it was religion, slash, humanitarian need to help your fellow man, because interestingly -- and I'm jumping ahead a little bit now, when I have spoken to them about why, they -- they sort of look at me in amazement and they say, "Well, we'd do it all over again."</sentence><sentence id="251">And Yolink's son said, "Well, I don't think it was such a big deal."</sentence><sentence id="252">Well, it was a big deal indeed, because, after all, they put their lives and their <span class="DLF">farms</span> and their families on the <span class="DLF">line</span> for us, but over and over, over the years, they have said, no, they would do it again and it was only the right thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="253">So, I guess it was indeed Christian as well as humanitarian.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="260">I'm jumping ahead also, to that wonderful moment you describe, o0-of the -- at the end of the war, when you gave thanks in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">And I wonder if you'd talk more about that.</sentence><sentence id="262">And I was interested also, when your host family -- and I think it was the mother who prayed, were -- did you also -- those of you who were Jewish, did you also offer thanks?</sentence><sentence id="263">Do you remember if there was more to the ceremony?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="272"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0024 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: Well, it wasn't really a ce -- I don't know if it wa -- it wasn't really a ceremony, it was all -- the war was over and we all came out of our little crevices and, as I had mentioned before, we sat around this, what looked to me like a huge, round <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> they sat at every night and they ate their porridge and then they played the organ and they sang hymns.</sentence><sentence id="274">So that the day of liberation, Mutter Hartaming, Mother Hartaming said, "Well, we should all sit down and eat," I guess the porridge or whatever it was, together and all of us did there, six, seven children, Father and Mutter Hartaming.</sentence><sentence id="275">My mother, my father and I, two or three other young men that were s-semi hiding there and our neighbors, whom I talked about on my tape, that had crawled into the <span class="DLF">hole</span> with us for the last few weeks.</sentence><sentence id="276">And we all sat around that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and then Mutter Hartaming simply said, "Well, let us pray."</sentence><sentence id="277">And we all sat and we bowed our heads and then she said, "I want to thank the good Lord for having allowed us to survive this and to be able to save --" and she named all of us and sort of said, "We thank the good Lord."</sentence><sentence id="278">And we all sat and then we said amen, and that was it and I think there were many a wet -- not too many dry eyes left after that.</sentence><sentence id="279">Also, I think the Sunday after our liberation, we came back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to accompany all of them to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> for a service, where we sat and prayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="280">We looked at the prayer books and prayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="281">Being Jewish didn't make any difference.</sentence><sentence id="282">And it was a very beautiful moment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Do you have a memory of the shape that people were in physically then?</sentence><sentence id="294">Would your parents -- I mean, would you be sitting in your -- the arms of one of your parents at that</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="299">ontectnetonancedjusinetneey for tarher biormatieraboutfisestecion</sentence></p><p><sentence id="300">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">farmhouse table</span> and think you were very weak, at the end of the war, but I wonder if the others too, were poorly nourished and ragged in your clothing and so on?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: As a matter of fact, no.</sentence><sentence id="302">I think all of us who came out, probably looked as well as we did when we went in.</sentence><sentence id="303">My mother, who was blonde, I think her har -- her hair may have darkened a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="304">And I had gotten rather heavy and I think part of this was due to the illness, coupled with inactivity and I think I was a rather roly-poly, with long hair.</sentence><sentence id="305">My father looked the same as he always did and the farmers themselves -- of course, we did not suffer from any malnourishment.</sentence><sentence id="306">We were always very adequately provided for.</sentence><sentence id="307">It may not have been gourmet food, but it certainly was good food and we -- what they had, they shared with us.</sentence><sentence id="308">So no, I think -- and clothing-wise, it's funny -- I don't remember that too well, I know I must have outgrown the few clothes that I had when I went in, but I also know that as soon as we came out, someone gave me clothes, perhaps some friends, to fit me and my mother immediately went in search of her dressmaker and found some material to have herself some dresses made.</sentence><sentence id="309">And dad had probably the same clothes he had before the war, so there was no -- no problem there, and I know when the war was over, we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinksburlow</span> and the first thing I did -- and I don't know why I did it, I had, at that time, very long braids, and I had them cut off, because I thought I had to start to look a little older, but I don't think it helped.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: And you -- your mother was blonde, you were dark-haired as a child, and that would increase the risk of you being discovered, is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: I wanted to -- you to tell me, first of all, in your first few months in hiding, when you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span>, what do you remember about following each day and having a sense of time then?</sentence><sentence id="558">And then go on to tell me how your mother coped and whether she was able to deal with the situation more ably than your father in his <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="559">And to what extent she always kept up her <span class="DLF">defenses</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="563">A: Interestingly, my recollections of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> are fairly vague.</sentence><sentence id="564">I see it in front of me, how we went into it and we were lying on those huge sacks of milled flour, I think it was and it had a very dr -- it was very dry and stuffy.</sentence><sentence id="565">It was as if you are constantly inhaling dust, but of course it didn't -- there was an odor to it, too.</sentence><sentence id="566">So, it was big enough that we could stretch out in it and we were lying there.</sentence><sentence id="567">I don't think we could sit [indecipherable] positive.</sentence><sentence id="568">And they would -- they put us in there and we had a little receptacle in case we had to use the toilet facilities.</sentence><sentence id="569">And must have been given some food.</sentence><sentence id="570">What I do remember</sentence></p><p><sentence id="573">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 20 quite well though, is at night, the daughter, or one of the daughters would come, open the lid and told us to go out, because this was in a -- in an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>-like <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="574">Opened up the lid, we would go out, stretch, walk and we were given food at that time and I guess maybe we washed ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="575">It's -- It is truly very vague.</sentence><sentence id="576">And while we were lying in there, my mother and I would of course talk incessantly and she always tried to put a positive thing on everything, this is only going to be a short time, they are going to find us another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and told me stories, which she did the whole time anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="577">But also, during that time, I wasn't well.</sentence><sentence id="578">And I think that was the -- probably already a forerunner of what was to come, because one evening, when the daughter took us out, I had chills and I was really not feeling well.</sentence><sentence id="579">I had the sore throat already.</sentence><sentence id="580">So, mother was ma -- mother was positive and I was, I think, fairly weepy and well, we stayed there and I wish I remembered how long it was.</sentence><sentence id="581">I can't believe it was all too long and then we were transferred to the other wonderful <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> that I called it, that we occupied for the remainder of the time.</sentence><sentence id="582">And, with respect to my father, there was little contact and strange, I -- I wasn't homesick for my father.</sentence><sentence id="583">I think I was too busy trying to adjust to that life that I had to lead there with my mother, that I could not think too much about my father's absence.</sentence><sentence id="584">It was [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: Tell me about the one occasion when your mother did let her feelings -- reveal her feelings to you, of disappointment.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: And it was only one occasion that that happened.</sentence><sentence id="587">It was during the time -- it must have been in "44, I think, when the allies had this aborted invasion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span>, near</sentence><sentence id="589">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0024 21 Ironham, I think that's eventually, what the movie, "One <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> Too Far," was based on and they were sent back and we had hoped that the end was in sight, and we were all so euphoric about it all.</sentence><sentence id="590">And then it all came to naught and then my mother was very down, I would almost say depressed, and said, "I don't think we'll ever get out of here."</sentence><sentence id="591">And another thing she said to Mutter Hartaming, "I guess if you had known that it would last this long, would you have taken -- you wouldn't have taken us."</sentence><sentence id="592">And she said, "We took you, no matter how long it would be."</sentence><sentence id="593">But my mother is one of these people who you can't keep down too long and she recovered from this tremendous disappointment and the farmer said to, "An end will come and you have to continue to hope."</sentence><sentence id="594">So, we went on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="605">Q: Well, I wanted to ask you about -- your mother told you stories, that helped to pass the time.</sentence><sentence id="606">Has that been important in your life since then?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: I think, in my years here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, alone, although -- because even while I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span>, I still felt very controlled by her.</sentence><sentence id="638">I was controlled as a young child, i.e. the cookie incident where, you know, you shouldn't always take -- accept cookies or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="639">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> and I only went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on occasions, but even then, I was supposed to -- to do her bidding.</sentence><sentence id="640">And I think one of the reasons that I went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when I did, and as I did, was probably to get -- become a little bit more independent, because | think I realized that she was too -- too controlling.</sentence><sentence id="641">And my father was not at all, but she was and I think that continued through my early and late adolescence and even my early adulthood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="647">Q: On the other hand, I cannot imagine that you would have survived if you had been in hiding, not allowed to come out of your <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, without your mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="664">Q: This was not a normal adolescence.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Tell me about how much of your experiences you shared with your children.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1952">A: Well, as I started to say, this is interesting, because when my husband and I first met, of course we talked about our backgrounds and what happened to him, what happened to me and in general, and very much aware of each of our histories.</sentence><sentence id="1953">And then we married and we really never talked about it any more -- very little.</sentence><sentence id="1954">Perhaps alluded to it here and there.</sentence><sentence id="1955">And then the children came, Tanya first, in "57 and David in 1960 and I think neither one of us ever really made it a point to -- to sit down and say, "Well, you want to know about what happened to us."</sentence><sentence id="1956">We may have touched it, we may have talked about it here and there, but not in depth.</sentence><sentence id="1957">And I think, as we got older, as the -- as we were less involved in the children's lives, namely once they were out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and out on their own, if you will, I think much later we started to think more about it and to discuss it more.</sentence><sentence id="1958">And even, you know, going more into details of what happened to us, particularly in my case, because my husband was always much more reluctant to talk about it because, you know, his parents, of course, had a very horrible ending.</sentence><sentence id="1959">And, as we sometimes said, he never really had a chance to grieve for them and it was always a little difficult for him to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1960">And as time went on, it wasn't as if we were hiding anything.</sentence><sentence id="1961">We answered and they knew I was in hiding and where I was in hiding and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1962">But I think it became very much topic A after I -- after we got involved</sentence><sentence id="1964"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0024 69 with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and after I gave my testimony and after my t -- my tape.</sentence><sentence id="1965">And I think then, we started to talk much more about what was than we did in the earlier years.</sentence><sentence id="1966">And I think part of it -- I really wasn't deliberate -- I think it was more we were very much engaged in working, bringing up children and making a life and did not really dwell on what was.</sentence><sentence id="1967">And I think, as we got older, we thought back, more about what happened and it's a reminiscence, really.</sentence><sentence id="1968">And again, as I said, the tape was sort of a -- a final presentation to them, as to the what and the whereabouts -- the wheres.
