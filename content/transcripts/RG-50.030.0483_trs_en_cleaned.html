<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Oh my God.</sentence><sentence id="10">Well, my childhood -- course in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> as you probably know, I didn't stay there very long.</sentence><sentence id="11">I mean I -- I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">My father was Hungarian, my mother German, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, it's no secret really, because my father's family would not have my mother, who was a very pretty young actress, much younger than my father, but extremely pretty, well they would not have her in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, not at -- at his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">So he had to give all this up, and he did, he gave it all up for her and bought a flat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and came to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, which is -- I -- it must have been -- I didn't know him, you know, he died when I was two, so I never knew him, but I gather he was a charming man, I bet he was.</sentence><sentence id="14">But he was 30 years older than she.</sentence><sentence id="15">So it -- one can imagine, can't one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Let [tape break] right --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: So they hear my dirty laugh all the way.</sentence><sentence id="25">Well, never mind.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: They hear your dirty laugh all the way.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: And what kind of people did she surround you with?</sentence><sentence id="62">I mean, were they actors, were they playwrights?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Well, they were partly actors, and partly ar -- aristocrats, because she was very -- as I said, she was very -- you know, a very sort.</sentence><sentence id="66">She went out a lot, she had absolutely beautiful clothes made by a little seamstress from models.</sentence><sentence id="67">The seamstress came once a week for two days.</sentence><sentence id="68">Abso --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: As often as that?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: As often as that.</sentence><sentence id="74">She had a lot of clothes, and she would go to all the <span class="BUILDING">sales</span>, sometimes dragging me along, and buy these abso -- the remnants, you know, of beautiful, beautiful materials.</sentence><sentence id="75">And this little seamstress, who was absolutely splendid, and was able to copy models.</sentence><sentence id="76">So anyway, all this, this was the sort of child life, until I was 11, and then by this time I had changed <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, had gone from, you know, my <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>, which was a very ordinary <span class="BUILDING">state school</span>, which I loved.</sentence><sentence id="77">I loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyway.</sentence><sentence id="78">I had gone to a <span class="BUILDING">riyah gimnasium</span>, which is sort of -- you know, a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> for girls, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lueetlan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">And -- and at 11 I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">My brother -- I had a brother who was four years older than I, Guido.</sentence><sentence id="81">Guido had already been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> years before, also at -- no he -- he ma -- he was sent at 12 actually, because my father wanted us brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, which was a very wise idea, I think.</sentence><sentence id="82">I mean, he also wanted us brought up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, which also happened, so you know -- not my brother, but I. So I -- I was able to speak these languages, you know, which is good.</sentence><sentence id="83">And then I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">dramatic school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Now there's an extraordinary incident that you've written about in 1934, when your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> broke down as you were going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Tell me about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="102">I was -- it was very interesting, I mean a -- it -- it broke down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, and it was the time of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> party day.</sentence><sentence id="103">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, they couldn't find --- well, I gath -- I gather they couldn't find a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to replace it, so they had to repair it, which was going to take five hours.</sentence><sentence id="104">And so the -- there was another child on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> by itself, so we were unaccompanied children.</sentence><sentence id="105">I was in my school uniform, which is brown and green, and the German Red Cross took us over, this little girl and me, who was also going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, not my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but another <span class="BUILDING">school</span>,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">and took us to the party day.</sentence><sentence id="109">And we were taken to the -- there was a children's sort of gallendare if you -- if you know what that means.</sentence><sentence id="110">I mean, it was just a -- you know, rows and rows of -- of -- of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> going up, all children, it was only children.</sentence><sentence id="111">And so we were taken way up, because there was -- there wasn't any <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, as you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="112">But they put us in there, and I just thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.</sentence><sentence id="113">It was absolutely magnificent.</sentence><sentence id="114">And you know, all the -- the -- the -- this wonderful rhythm and these -- these -- these clean looking boys and -- and girls -- I mean and also marching, you know, people.</sentence><sentence id="115">And then of course there were these speeches, and I had absolutely no idea what they were saying.</sentence><sentence id="116">I mean, I didn't understand a word.</sentence><sentence id="117">But I screamed like everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="118">I mean, I thought it was just so exciting.</sentence><sentence id="119">I had never been so excited in my life, I think.</sentence><sentence id="120">The colors, and the -- I don't know, the -- the music, and the -- the rhythm, you know, there was just -- it was <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> like you - - one -- it's almost indescribable of course, you -- you've seen it, everybody has seen it on film.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="121">But of course here I was actually seeing it, you know, and the colors are quite different when you are actually watching these -- these -- these flags wave, you know, in the wind.</sentence><sentence id="122">And you're there, and they're -- and you -- you get the wind, the -- that the s -- that the flags made, that they were all -- all around, they were everywhere, and there were thousands of flags.</sentence><sentence id="123">It was just beautiful.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="124">And anyway, so I -- I screamed like everybody else, heil, heil, and I don't know who he was -- I didn't know who he was, but anyway --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Did you have any idea what it was about, what it signified?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: No, I knew it was the German National -- you know, I knew he was the leader of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I knew that I had heard of course grown-ups, my mother -- my -- my mother's friends.</sentence><sentence id="127">I had heard people say that he was a bad man, but of course I had no idea why he should be a bad man, it was so pretty.</sentence><sentence id="128">Why should he be bad, you know?</sentence><sentence id="129">And -- and to me it was just absolutely</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="133">wonderful, as to everybody else there.</sentence><sentence id="134">So anyway then -- then there was the interesting thing, which I have written about, I came to -- came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">I had this wonderful teacher whom I adored, Lee Hindly.</sentence><sentence id="136">She died fairly recently.</sentence><sentence id="137">Lee Chadwick afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="138">Well Lee Hindly, who I thought was a -- you know, fantastically grown up lady, becau -- I think she was 24, I mean -- and she was a very, very English, English girl -- young woman, with this wonderful voice, and this -- you know, this -- this absolutely beautiful -- not 0 -- Oxford English, but just the real sort of -- I-I can't describe it, I mean, I just thought it was divine, and of course she taught me every word I learned.</sentence><sentence id="139">I mean, I knew -- I didn't know a word of English when I came there.</sentence><sentence id="140">And she was very, very kind, and I adored her.</sentence><sentence id="141">Anyway, I arrived back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and -- and I wrote this -- we were supposed to write this, you know, this [indecipherable] this eg -- essay about our most beautiful day of the holidays.</sentence><sentence id="142">Well, naturally I wrote about this.</sentence><sentence id="143">And -- and she read it, and -- and having read all the others, a prize was given for a girl who wrote -- little girl who wrote about a stallion having -- I mean, not a stallion, a -- a -- a horse having a baby, I me -- wonderful, wonderful story.</sentence><sentence id="144">And -- and she -- she said to me, that's a very good job of work, so that was enough for me.</sentence><sentence id="145">And then she said, "Can you stay here a minute afterwards?"</sentence><sentence id="146">After the lessons, so I did.</sentence><sentence id="147">And she said, "I brought this for you, and I want you to read it."</sentence><sentence id="148">And she gave me this book, in English.</sentence><sentence id="149">And I said, "What is it?"</sentence><sentence id="150">It said Mein Kampf in German underneath, and said, you know, my battle.</sentence><sentence id="151">And I said, "What is this?"</sentence><sentence id="152">And she said, "Well, the man you saw speak wrote this book about his plans for Europe, and I want you to read it."</sentence><sentence id="153">And I said, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="154">And she said, "Because anybody who comes from your corner of the world needs to read this book."</sentence><sentence id="155">She -- I later found out, I didn't know this, nobody knew this -- she was a member of the Communist party, and she became really very active indeed.</sentence><sentence id="156">In fact, you know later, much later, years later, she became a councilor for the Communist party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldeburough</span>, in</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="160"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laseton</span> where she lived, having married twice, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="161">Anyway, she was -- she continued to be absolutely wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I read this book.</sentence><sentence id="163">I mean, I can't say I read this book, but I read into this book.</sentence><sentence id="164">It was impossible for me to read the whole book, you know.</sentence><sentence id="165">I wa --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: You were 11, right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: I was -- yes, I was 11.</sentence><sentence id="168">I mean, I was -- I was 11 and a half by then, because it was six months -- Pd been in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for six months by then.</sentence><sentence id="169">And you know, I -- I did understand it.</sentence><sentence id="170">I mean, I would -- well, I would have said probably I read a third of it, you know, read here -- reading here and there, and there, and there, jumping, of course, which she knew I would.</sentence><sentence id="171">I mean it was impossible to read for -- for an 11 year old.</sentence><sentence id="172">But I -- I knew perfectly well that -- I saw perfectly well.</sentence><sentence id="173">I never understood how people told me afterwards they -- well, they couldn't read it to start out with, they hadn't read it, which was a lie.</sentence><sentence id="174">Everybody said they hadn't read it.</sentence><sentence id="175">All -- all ger -- I don't think I -- well no, I did meet some Germans who admitted to having read it, but most Germans, including Speer, indeed, said they hadn't read it, that you know it was that Hitler wa -- ca -- in Speer's case, Hitler told him it was -- it was way over, it was -- it was too late, not to bother.</sentence><sentence id="176">I mean, so many things had happened that it was -- we were holed, as they said.</sentence><sentence id="177">Anyway, so I brought it back to Lee, to Miss Hindly, and -- and she said, "Well what did you think of it?"</sentence><sentence id="178">And I said, "Well, I da -- I -- two things.</sentence><sentence id="179">I mean, what I -- I mean, how is he go -- I mean, he wants to -- he wants Europe, he wants to rule over Europe, that seems quite clear.</sentence><sentence id="180">But how can he do this," I ask, "without a war?"</sentence><sentence id="181">And she said, "Well, I'm asking you, you tell me."</sentence><sentence id="182">I said, "Well, I mean, other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> aren't just going to give him their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>."</sentence><sentence id="183">And she said, "Uh- huh, mm-hm."</sentence><sentence id="184">And I said, "And what is he going on about the Jews?</sentence><sentence id="185">I mean, he keeps talking about the Jews, and he says awfully nasty things about them."</sentence><sentence id="186">And she said, "He hates them."</sentence><sentence id="187">So I said, "But why?"</sentence><sentence id="188">And she said, "I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="189">You will have to make up your mind yourself in</sentence><sentence id="191">the end.</sentence><sentence id="192">Learn it, read, and maybe you'll find out."</sentence><sentence id="193">But of course I never did until, you know, until I did this work, which I did much later.</sentence><sentence id="194">Probably this is where of my -- my wish to do something started, without my knowing it, of course, you know.</sentence><sentence id="195">Anyway, that's my childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Now, you've written that your most influential and important years were your teens and 20's.</sentence></p></dialogue>

"</sentence><sentence id="259">I don't know," I said, "I don't know, 10 - 20?"</sentence><sentence id="260">She said, "Right."</sentence><sentence id="261">And you know, it was not two hours later that 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> arrived, and two nights later we had 56, and they came during the day, and we had 56 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> by that night.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: How was sh -- how was that organized?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: She bought them.</sentence><sentence id="299">She was a millionaire.</sentence><sentence id="300">I mean it's wonderful when you're very rich, you know, you just pa -- pick up the telephone.</sentence><sentence id="301">She picked up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>, she ordered 56 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: What was the extent of your duties while you were doing this work?</sentence></p></dialogue>

how many there were, you know, I</sentence><sentence id="698">1 didn't count them.</sentence><sentence id="699">And then slowly they got up and they disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="700">And then

her father had been an illegal Nazi, and -- and he had told her, the day before this happened, on the 13" of March, my birthday, he had told her that -- or was it even on the 12", at dinnertime, he said that she was never to talk to any Jew again, and that all these s-sou -- Saujuden they called them, they would all be taken care of, or whatever, you know, eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="711">And she told me this.</sentence><sentence id="712">She was in despair.</sentence><sentence id="713">She was really in despair, because we loved all these teachers, you

liked him already for that.</sentence><sentence id="720">And then for some or other reason he liked me, I don't know why, but he did, because I really was not a -- I was not a -- well, I mean there

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="825">A: Well, I returned for the purpose of serving in displaced person's camps.</sentence><sentence id="826">They needed people with languages, and of course they needed to -- they were very keen to have somebody who already had experience with children -- with children such as the children I had taken care of in</sentence><sentence id="828">3 <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">And so I -- I was sent -- I was engaged as a -- as an assistant, because I was young, an assistant child welfare officer.</sentence><sentence id="830">I then became a -- you know, I was promoted, but I went there in a rather junior position, and I'm trying to think where my first assignment was.</sentence><sentence id="831">Yes, my first assignment -- well, I was first, as a matter of fact, my very first assignment was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, which was quite a shock because I'd -- I didn't realize that that would be my first assignment.</sentence><sentence id="832">We were all -- we all went first to a t -- a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span>, which was the -- the western allied headquarters for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="833">And a huge, huge sort of -- oh, it was this -- you know, former I don't know what it was, but hundreds of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and things, and -- and that's where we all stayed for awhile, had various lessons in this and that, and orientation, and then were assigned from there.</sentence><sentence id="834">And to my great surprise, I was called in and I was told that I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="835">And I said, "But there are no children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>."</sentence><sentence id="836">And the -- the woman who was talking to me, she said, "I'm afraid you're going to have a rather shocking surprise."</sentence><sentence id="837">Which I did.</sentence><sentence id="838">I really did have a shocking surprise, because there were a lot of children.</sentence><sentence id="839">Of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was not -- you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> is much misunderstood in the -- in the literature, and by historians.</sentence><sentence id="840"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, as you probably know, was the fi -- I shouldn't be addressing you, but anyway, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> the Nazis opened, and it was purely a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">political camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="841">It was for -- it was intended for German political prisoners, and some cr -- and some criminal prisoners, who usually became, in fact, the kapos.</sentence><sentence id="842">It was not intended for Jews at all.</sentence><sentence id="843">And later it was represented as an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span>, which it never was.</sentence><sentence id="844">I have just read a -- a completely new book, which in fact has not yet been published, but is about to be published in three weeks in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and it still has this presentation of it, which is really a great shame.</sentence><sentence id="845">This is particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that they misrepresented.</sentence><sentence id="846">It is as if it's a need, always to associate, you know, the Nazis with the crime against the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="847">Now, of course, all of us who write, up to a point, have to do this,</sentence><sentence id="849">4 because it was the worst thing they did, and you cannot not do it.</sentence><sentence id="850">But if you do that exclusively, then you are misrepresenting history.</sentence><sentence id="851">And you're misrepresenting what Hitler was, what his plan was, what the whole thing was, and why the danger was so enormous, you know, for the whole of Europe, or the world.</sentence><sentence id="852">I mean, the death of the Jews was the worst thing, of course, and the factory killings, and -- but it was -- basically it was a part of a huge geopolitical program which really the -- most of the world doesn't know because it has so focused on that one part of it.</sentence><sentence id="853">And it's understandable, I mean, emotion is understandable, but historically it's wrong.</sentence><sentence id="854">Anyway, so when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, there was -- there were all these kids.</sentence><sentence id="855">And there were two groups of kids, which is also extremely interesting.</sentence><sentence id="856">There were the child -- there were no Jewish children, virtually no Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="857">Maybe one or two <span class="NPIP">somewhere</span>, but this was not -- you know, the Jewish children -- no, there were more than one or two, there were -- there were a few, but it was -- there -- that was the easiest.</sentence><sentence id="858">They brought in -- <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> had a -- had a special issue, like a special division for taking care of -- of Jews who survived the Nazis, and they very sensibly assigned to this, or made responsible for this division, Jewish UNRRA officials.</sentence><sentence id="859">I mean, it was the right thing to do, because they understood better, and they can deal with it better, and they could -- and they would be accepted much better by these victims.</sentence><sentence id="860">And so this is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="861">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> too, within da -- I mean, I came there very soon after it was -- after the Americans arrived.</sentence><sentence id="862">I mean, really within days.</sentence><sentence id="863">And within -- again within days, some of UNRRA officers arrived, who took away the Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="864">That was -- you know, that was wonderfully organized.</sentence><sentence id="865">So I was left with another -- with another <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">I think she was -- I think she was a higher rank than I. But anyway, we were friends, though, and oh became -- had become friends.</sentence><sentence id="867">And we put in -- were in charge of these children.</sentence><sentence id="868">And you have -- these were all on the one hand, children whose parents had been brought into -- into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as forced laborers.</sentence><sentence id="869">So</sentence><sentence id="871">5 they were mostly Polish and Russian children.</sentence><sentence id="872">They spoke no German, they spoke Polish and Russian, and a few words of German here and there.</sentence><sentence id="873">Some Czech children, but mostly, as I say, it was eastern European children, who had either been brought in by themselves, or they had been brought in after their parents had been taken in with them.</sentence><sentence id="874">Because in quite many -- in quite a few cases, the Nazis brought in people from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, letting them take their smaller children.</sentence><sentence id="875">In quite a few cases, not -- not -- not -- not -- it was not a rarity.</sentence><sentence id="876">So we were landed with quite a few quite young children, who couldn't speak [indecipherable] the girl who was -- sorry, the girl who was with me was of Polish descent, an American of Polish descent.</sentence><sentence id="877">She spoke Polish, which was a great help.</sentence><sentence id="878">Anyway, so that was one group, and the other group were German children.</sentence><sentence id="879">And they were the children of the 20" of July German officers, who had been in the assassination plan against Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="880">This was an extraordinary thing, because here you had these German children, who had gone to elite <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, you know, who were very, very German children.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1681">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1682">I'm not absolutely sure about that, but I think so.</sentence><sentence id="1683">Anyway, it's in my book.</sentence><sentence id="1684">And you know, after one day of sitting there, I knew that -- that -- that Spiess had hit the nail on the head.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1685">This was a slightly different man.</sentence><sentence id="1686">It was -- the degree was very small, how he was different, but there was just -- there was a sadness about Stangl, which I had not found in any of the others, and which Spiess had not found in any of the others.</sentence><sentence id="1687">They were arrogant, they were hard.</sentence><sentence id="1688">They were proud of what they had done.</sentence><sentence id="1689">Stang was not proud.</sentence><sentence id="1690">And quite aside from that, he was sad.</sentence><sentence id="1691">And I thought, if he was capable of being sad, unless we find out that it's only about his situation, if he was capable of being sad about the whole thing, then there was that remnant of conscience, which of course I did find in him.</sentence><sentence id="1692">Took me a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1693">Took me a very long time to find it, but I did find it.</sentence><sentence id="1694">And he was the right choice.</sentence><sentence id="1695">I mean, I couldn't have done this with -- with any of the others.</sentence><sentence id="1696">I met several of the others before, and of course after I met him.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And -- and tried to talk to them, too.</sentence><sentence id="1698">And only one of I met, who -- but he was not -- he was just not as intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="1699">I mean, Stangl was not very intelligent, but he was more intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="1700">And in fact, if he hadn't been more intelligent, he wouldn't have been given the job he was given.</sentence><sentence id="1701">I mean, he was a -- he had an enormous job.</sentence><sentence id="1702">I mean, commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>, you could not have a bigger job in that branch of the SS or Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1703">It was impossible to have a bigger job.</sentence><sentence id="1704">So of course he had the qualifications.</sentence><sentence id="1705">He was a brilliant organizer, which is what was mostly needed.</sentence><sentence id="1706">And -- and he was a -- he was a man, in a way -- don't misunderstand it, but he -- he was a man in a way, of quality, in that he had no -- no vices.</sentence><sentence id="1707">He was not a drunkard, he didn't play around with women.</sentence><sentence id="1708">He didn't, of course, didn't gamble, or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And he was not a man given to violence.</sentence><sentence id="1710">So there were four things, which no doubt the Nazi bigwigs who appointed him saw just as much as I did.</sentence><sentence id="1711">I mean, they had him first -- his first assignment, his first -- I mean, he was a police officer, of course, an Austrian.</sentence><sentence id="1712">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.114063" long="13.940913">Wels</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1713">He</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1717">5 was a provincial.</sentence><sentence id="1718">And his first assignment as a police officer, was to become the police head of <span class="BUILDING">Schloss Hartheim</span>, which was a euthanasia institute.</sentence><sentence id="1719">Bad enough, God knows.</sentence><sentence id="1720">And there -- and th-these <span class="BUILDING">euthanasia institutes</span>, where they appointed 96 SS people to become either heads or, you know, or officials there.</sentence><sentence id="1721">Always in higher positions, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1722">Under them they would have Ukrainians and Latvians, and usually <span class="REGION">Baltics</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1723">They could, of course observe and -- and see these quote, qualities, unquote, which I have mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="1724">Because already in the <span class="BUILDING">euthanasia institute</span>, I mean, it was quite clear that he had these qualities.</sentence><sentence id="1725">And so he was -- he was predestined to be promoted, there's no doubt about it.</sentence><sentence id="1726">And then he -- he -- he got these two jobs, first at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>, as a kind of preparation, which he opened, which he started, built.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And then of course, the worst one of them all, <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2243">A: I spent three weeks with him, every day.</sentence><sentence id="2244">And then I went back and spent another week with him.</sentence><sentence id="2245">So all together I spent four weeks with him.</sentence><sentence id="2246">But this -- these were long days, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2247">I mean, I came there at nine in the morning, stayed until half past 12, I think it was, came back at a half past one, and stayed until five.</sentence><sentence id="2248">Now -- during which time he talked all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2255">Q: What is it that's kind of burned itself into your mind of -- of what he told you?</sentence><sentence id="2256">What are the images, or the particular stories that you can't forget?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2259">A: Well, first, no -- I do -- I can't tell the stories, but I mean what -- what set -- burnt itself into my mind at first, and which has been confirmed by -- you know, by -- by many other talks I've</sentence><sentence id="2261">8 had with people such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span>, is their self pity.</sentence><sentence id="2262">I mean, first there is the self pity which is perfectly justified, about their childhoods.</sentence><sentence id="2263">Every one of them had a terrible childhood, I mean it's extraordinary.</sentence><sentence id="2264">It's extraordinary, I'm -- I'm horrified at the number of terrible childhoods there are.</sentence><sentence id="2265">And it's true, you know, because I looked into it afterwards in each case, and I found out, absolutely confirmed, beaten, all the rest of it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2266">Absolutely true.</sentence><sentence id="2267">And -- and these children are conditioned, for God's sake, for violence.</sentence><sentence id="2268">You be violent with a child, and the child in conditioned toward violence.</sentence><sentence id="2269">I'm not saying that every child that is beaten as a child is going to become a Stangl, of course not.</sentence><sentence id="2270">But if the circumstances are created, where becoming a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span>, or something like that, is admirable in the eyes of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2271">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="2272">And -- and for Stang] this was exactly it, | mean it was admirable what he was doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2289">Q: So from what you tell me, I mean there is no sense of, you know, being when you -- you're in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with Stangl, of being in the presence of evil.</sentence><sentence id="2290">You're in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a provincial Austrian policeman who got lucky, or what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2293">A: No, you're in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a -- it's not -- that's too simple, really.</sentence><sentence id="2294">And you're just saying this to draw me out, I know.</sentence><sentence id="2295">But of course it's too simple.</sentence><sentence id="2296">You can never simplify somebody like Stangl, you can say -- I can say here is just a provincial Austrian.</sentence><sentence id="2297">Of course he was just a convincial -- provincial Austrian.</sentence><sentence id="2298">But he was a provincial Austrian who went through a series of experiences which burned itself into his spirit, and corrupted him totally.</sentence><sentence id="2299">He was a totally corrupt man.</sentence><sentence id="2300">A man who should never have been allowed again into the presence of children.</sentence><sentence id="2301">Which is what his wife felt, eventually, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2302">I mean -- and -- and I'm not even saying that -- you know, I'm not even saying that you can blame only Stang] for this.</sentence><sentence id="2303">You have to blame -- you have to blame the whole -- the circumstances, and the environment.</sentence><sentence id="2304">So the people who created this environment, are of course as blameworthy as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2305">Do you see what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2306">I mean, of</sentence><sentence id="2308">9 course Stangl, had he had the right help from his wife, he could have got out of it.</sentence><sentence id="2309">But it would have been difficult, and demanded, you know, character.</sentence><sentence id="2310">I mean, the kind of character he didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="2311">I mean the kind of civic courage that he didn't have, and also some conviction of sorts that he didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="2312">For instance, the conviction that no one person, because he was Jewish, is bad, rather than another person is good.</sentence><sentence id="2313">I mean, it -- it simply -- thi -- thi -- this is -- the moment this division exists in the person, where to him, you know, where a Russian is bad, and an Englishman is good -- I mean, this is total bullshit of course, total nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="2314">And the moment you feel anything like that, which is one of the dangers of war by the way, you're lost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2339">Q: What was the experience like for you?</sentence><sentence id="2340">Apart -- you've said that it was fascinating, but when you open that <span class="DLF">door</span> every morning, okay you're fascinated, and you want to know, and you're getting somewhere, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2341">A: No, but it's not okay you're fascinated.</sentence><sentence id="2342">I mean the fascination is -- you know, the intellectual challenge is tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="2343">I mean, it's a tremendous -- I mean it's like -- it's like alcohol.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2344">Q: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2346">A: You know, it's a tremendous thing, in which -- which is -- which was one thing with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span> where I was -- where I was -- the one thing I was worried about, about myself with these conversations with Stangl, is that I was constantly the superior.</sentence><sentence id="2347">This is very dangerous for anyone's character.</sentence><sentence id="2348">It's very bad for you.</sentence><sentence id="2349">And I was lucky enough that, you know, I had this wonderful family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2350">I had the counterweight of my extremely intelligent husband, and you know, very intelligent children.</sentence><sentence id="2351">So not -- I'm saying intelligent because you know, you feel that you are so much in command, that your brain is more in your mind than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="2352">I mean, there were moments when I -- I -- I knew I couldn't go on, and I then could go on, because that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="2353">But -- but it was very different, of course, when I undertook this thing with sha --</sentence><sentence id="2355">0 with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Speer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">Because Speer was not just my equal, but he was way superior to me in intellect.</sentence><sentence id="2357">He was far more cultive than -- than I was at the time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2358">He had read far more.</sentence><sentence id="2359">He -- he -- he was a -- an absolutely extraordinary man, and so it -- it was a completely different challenge.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2376">Q: Tell me a little about it.</sentence><sentence id="2377">Let's move on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Speer</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: Well, Speer -- Speer, whom I didn't like when he -- when h-he -- Speer asked me to do this.</sentence><sentence id="2381">I mean, he got in touch with me having read, "Into That Darkness."</sentence><sentence id="2382">And obviously -- I mean, as I said before, these people want to speak, they want to talk.</sentence><sentence id="2383">And Speer read, "Into That Darkness," which kept him sleepless, he said, for several nights.</sentence><sentence id="2384">And -- and he decided that this was somebody he could talk to.</sentence><sentence id="2385">Now Speer had talked to a lot of people, you know, because he was, of course, a huge personality, of enormous importance historically.</sentence><sentence id="2386">And I suppose every major journalist in the world -- certainly in the <span class="REGION">western world</span>, tried to talk to Speer.</sentence><sentence id="2387">I mean, it would have been insane not to.</sentence><sentence id="2388">I didn't like him.</sentence><sentence id="2389">I saw him on TV, I -- you know, I read -- of course I read his books.</sentence><sentence id="2390">I thought he was an arrogant man.</sentence><sentence id="2391">His charm did not charm me.</sentence><sentence id="2392">| thought his -- he was very suave, and I couldn't bear it.</sentence><sentence id="2393">So when he -- when he wrote to me, and then followed this up with quite a lot of phone calls, I was -- I was very reluctant indeed.</sentence><sentence id="2394">He became -- he became very atta -- not attached, that's the wrong word, but he -- he liked my husband very much, already on the telephone.</sentence><sentence id="2395">I mean, they had these long conversations on art, about which Speer knew, I mean far more than either of us, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2396">But also, Don knows far more than I, but Speer knew far, far more than -- and -- and it was quite interesting for my husband, you know, who was still very actively on "Vogue," and doing lots of photography, also to do with artists and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2397">So it was all very interesting for him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2416">Q: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2418">A: And he -- he didn't like Speer very much, any more than I did, but -- on the phone, I mean.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2422">Q: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2423">A: But somehow a kind of relationship developed, and when there had been, you know, something -- I don't know how many weeks it was, it was several weeks of these phone calls which came in from Speer, all asking me, well when would I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>, and I mean wasn't I planning?</sentence><sentence id="2424">I was so often in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, wasn't I -- blah, blah, blah, blah.</sentence><sentence id="2425">And finally I thought, what is the matter with me?</sentence><sentence id="2426">I mean, if th -- this man is so desperate for me to do a Stangl on him, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2427">I'll do it.</sentence><sentence id="2428">You know, as vulgarly as that, I thought.</sentence><sentence id="2429">And of course that kind of thought immediately disappeared the moment I met him.</sentence><sentence id="2430">I've got to say, I mean really.</sentence><sentence id="2431">I mean, we were -- we went to have lunch with him and his wife in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> [indecipherable], and there was this humble man.</sentence><sentence id="2432">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> he was just as arrogant as on TV.</sentence><sentence id="2433">So every tra - - telephone call supported my -- exta -- not every, some of them there was this curious humility.</sentence><sentence id="2434">Anyway, at lunch, I mean, you know, there was a different man.</sentence><sentence id="2435">And I thought, well wait a minute, maybe I'm all wrong about this.</sentence><sentence id="2436">What is this man, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2437">What is this?</sentence><sentence id="2438">And of course, he talked a lot during a long, long lunch.</sentence><sentence id="2439">And talked a lot about it, about Hitler, which is what I encouraged him to do.</sentence><sentence id="2440">And by the end of the lunch, and Don and I went back to our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, I said, "Jesus, of course the one thing that in all these weeks I didn't think about, was that this man was the closest to Hitler of anyone in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2441">Am I crazy not to want to talk to him?"</sentence><sentence id="2442">Don said, "Oh yes, you're crazy."</sentence><sentence id="2443">So -- so anyway, that's how it started, you know, and of course the moment I started talking to him, I -- one's attitude changes.</sentence><sentence id="2444">Once -- as I told you, once -- once people start talking about their childhood, and with me they always have to talk about their childhood first, because I think everything starts in childhood.</sentence><sentence id="2445">I know that this is a -- a cliche thing to say, and Freudian and all the rest of it, but it's not Freudian, it's -- it's purely human.</sentence><sentence id="2446">It doesn't apply to everybody either, I have to say.</sentence><sentence id="2447">Because you can have a rotten</sentence><sentence id="2449">2 childhood, or a difficult childhood, and still become a perfectly ordinary and good person.</sentence><sentence id="2450">So it doesn't apply to everybody, but somebody who then develops in a certain way, and has had a terrible childhood, then you can find -- you know, you can find connections.</sentence><sentence id="2451">And certainly with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Speer</span> there were very, very strong connections.</sentence><sentence id="2452">He was extraordinary lonely as a child.</sentence><sentence id="2453">I mean, the middle child of three, and neither liked by his father, nor by his mother, who liked the two at the other -- one each, you know, of the other brothers.</sentence><sentence id="2454">He was very alone throughout his childhood.</sentence><sentence id="2455">And -- and -- an-and really suffered under it, I mean, he -- he suffer -- he had a -- he had a suffering childhood, Speer, which is odd.</sentence><sentence id="2456">So when he found Hitler, of course it must have been the most extraordinary experience.</sentence><sentence id="2457">And when Hitler found Speer it must have been the extraordinary experience, because, you know, if you want to make it very simple -- and why not make it simple, then a man who had never been a father, found a son.</sentence><sentence id="2458">And a son who had never had a father, found a father.</sentence><sentence id="2459">It's as simple as that, really, except it's much more complicated.</sentence><sentence id="2460">But start with the simple things, and you find answers.</sentence><sentence id="2461">Because certainly Speer and Hitler loved each other.</sentence><sentence id="2462">They loved each other.</sentence><sentence id="2463">And it took Speer -- it took Speer all those years to understand, partly, that there was something terribly wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2464">And he never, never understood it really, until he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span>, and was alone, and could read.</sentence><sentence id="2465">You know, he read 5,000 books in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2466">And boy, he could read, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2467">And he c -- he -- by the time I met him, he knew -- boy, he knew more than anybody else did.</sentence><sentence id="2468">He really did.</sentence><sentence id="2469">I think he knew more about the Nazis -- of course, knew more about Hitler than everybody else did, but he understood more than anybody else did.</sentence><sentence id="2470">And as for this one part of this Nazism, which everybody, of course, as you -- as you know, I think, is exclusively concerned with, Speer was never an ideological anti-Semite.</sentence><sentence id="2471">He was an anti-Semite because they were all anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="2472">But he was not an ideological anti-Semite.</sentence><sentence id="2473">He could manage with anybody, actually.</sentence><sentence id="2474">And he could manage, of course after -- I mean, after</sentence><sentence id="2476">3 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span>, I mean my God, I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> he -- you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> he had a -- a great deal to do with -- with Jewish officers, and actually had -- I mean, he even emotionally changed a lot there.</sentence><sentence id="2477">You see, it was a -- it was a tremendous opening of understanding of what people were, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2478">People, that it's not -- it's not where they come from, it -- but what they are.</sentence><sentence id="2479">Which is the only thing that counts.</sentence><sentence id="2480">I mean, it doesn't matter where anybody comes from, what religion, or what they like to call race.</sentence><sentence id="2481">I mean, this ridiculous and dreadful word, race.</sentence><sentence id="2482">It's -- it's totally unimportant, the only thing that matters is what the individual is, with a capital I. And that's what Speer -- what Speer certainly learned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2483">So you know by the time -- by the time he came to me, I mean he was really preconditioned to really talking.</sentence><sentence id="2484">And he did, I mean he -- he -- Speer t-taught me more than I could ever give him.</sentence><sentence id="2485">He would have hated this book, of course, absolutely hated it.</sentence><sentence id="2486">He was very, you know, he was very, very dubious about what I would write.</sentence><sentence id="2487">And he was so right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2560">A: Yes, he -- b-because once, you see that that's -- that of course is -- I mean, it's the secret, you know, I mean what have I been doing for the last three hours -- you know, three and a half hours, when I really told myself, and told Don, three hours is it, no more.</sentence><sentence id="2561">And -- and I have talked to you.</sentence><sentence id="2562">When people start to talk, they talk, because the point is that -- and this applies to almost everybody, as you have found, too, I'm quite sure in your professional life.</sentence><sentence id="2563">But people like Speer -- and I won't say people like I, because I don't mean to compare myself to Speer, but -- but --</sentence><sentence id="2565">4 but people of some, if you like, some intellect, or some -- they are not protected by this.</sentence><sentence id="2566">They need it just as much, or it happens just as much.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And certainly Speer -- I mean there were days when he -- when he obviously had had some experience with jailers, or whatever, I don't know, when he -- when it was really very difficult to get him to go on.</sentence><sentence id="2568">But on the whole, he was completely different, of course, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stangl</span>, I mean obviously.</sentence><sentence id="2569">But he was looking forward to these conversations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2582">Q: How tortured was he emotionally by the process you put him through, and the process he put himself through in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2584">A: He was -- Speer was -- I tell you Speer was more tortured by guilt than anybody I've ever met.</sentence><sentence id="2585">He felt guilty for every Jewish death.</sentence><sentence id="2586">Every one of the six million.</sentence><sentence id="2587">And he never said that, but I know this, I know this.</sentence><sentence id="2588">He was desperate about it.</sentence><sentence id="2589">The only mistake was -- and I could never, never -- I could never persuade him of this, that he too felt that that was the only thing he needed to feel guilty about.</sentence><sentence id="2590">And when I said to him, and I did of course, not once, but oh, how many times, you brought the forced laborers to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, you are responsible for the death of a hundred thousand of them.</sentence><sentence id="2591">This was your work, not Sowers, who was hanged for it.</sentence><sentence id="2592">He was under your orders, it was yours.</sentence><sentence id="2593">It simply didn't touch him, it was like -- as if I didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2594">I might as well have kept my mouth shut.</sentence><sentence id="2595">He felt no guilt for this.</sentence><sentence id="2596">This was part of his - - I won't call it duty, but it was -- it was simply part of what he was there for.</sentence><sentence id="2597">And as far as he was concerned, of course -- and this is true, I mean, of course I checked all this.</sentence><sentence id="2598">When he found out that foreign laborers -- I mean, fo -- he called them Gastarbeiter, but <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, they weren't Gastarbeiter.</sentence><sentence id="2599">When fo -- foreign laborers were mistreated anywhere, if he found out, he took measures.</sentence><sentence id="2600">He did.</sentence><sentence id="2601">And -- and you know, he mentioned a number of occasions to me.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Every occasion that I could look into, I did.</sentence><sentence id="2603">Every single one of them was confirmed.</sentence><sentence id="2604">He took steps, it</sentence><sentence id="2606">5 was changed, the people were properly treated, they were moved into different <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were properly treat -- or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2607">So, he did.</sentence><sentence id="2608">Even so, the system, it is the system, and he agreed to the system, and he supported it, and he was Hitler's closest friend, and he was responsible for God's sake.</sentence><sentence id="2609">He was responsible, he was responsible for their deaths.</sentence><sentence id="2610">But he knew it, you see, and he was -- he was the unhappiest man of all the Nazis I met.</sentence><sentence id="2611">He was the most important, and he was the unhappiest.</sentence></p></dialogue>
