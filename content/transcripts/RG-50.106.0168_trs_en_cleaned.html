things.</sentence><sentence id="971">I was looking after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was -- I was very domesticated and I loved to -- I loved to cook, so that kept me

id="1018">So I worked there and actually where I should backtrack and say that when I went to work for the -- for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, after I was there for six months they say
