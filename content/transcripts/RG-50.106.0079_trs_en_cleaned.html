<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1297">Q: And what was that experience like for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1299">A: Well, that was a really very -- it's emotionally a difficult experience, but we -- we decided that we wanted to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1300">And we adopted them through the <span class="BUILDING">Louise Wise Agency</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1301">And that was quite an experience in itself, going through that procedure.</sentence><sentence id="1302">But I must say they -- they were supportive because they saw we were sincere and they felt that we would make good parents.</sentence><sentence id="1303">And we adopted our son then when he was -- well, he was about three months old.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And so then short -- then three years later we decided maybe we should try for another adoption, which was very unusual.</sentence><sentence id="1305">The agency did not give out a lot of second children.</sentence><sentence id="1306">They had just</sentence><sentence id="1308">started a program -- in fact, initially, when we adopted our son, they gave out no second children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1320">Q: Was that because they didn't have enough children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1322">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1324">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1326">A: And then they, somewhere during that time period, apparently, they started a program for giving out second children.</sentence><sentence id="1327">They felt that perhaps it might be good for the children, that they would have siblings, or go to a family, not be an only child.</sentence><sentence id="1328">So they started a program to place second children, and we were able to get into that program.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And then we adopted my daughter about three years after my son.</sentence><sentence id="1330">And she again was about three months old when we adopted her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1336">Q: And were they Jewish babies?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1338">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1339">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time, the law was that you -- they -- the children could only be placed in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of the religion of their mother.</sentence><sentence id="1340">So the agency could only place Jewish children, and it could only place them in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1341">Except that there was one exce -- an interesting exception.</sentence><sentence id="1342">There was a program for Native Americans adoption.</sentence><sentence id="1343">You c -- the law did not apply to Native Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1344">And they also had a program for placing Native American children.</sentence><sentence id="1345">It was a rather small</sentence><sentence id="1347">program.</sentence><sentence id="1348">We never got -- did adopt a Native American child.</sentence><sentence id="1349">But that was the only exception at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1363">Q: Would that have been your choice, to adopt Jewish babies?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: Not necessarily, because we -- they could have become Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1366">So that -- it just worked out that way because when we went -- the agents -- had we not been able to adopt through the <span class="BUILDING">agency</span>, we probably would have tried some other means, but it all worked out very well.</sentence><sentence id="1367">So -- and -- so then after we adopted my daughter -- well, first of all, the agency required that you have a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for each of the children, that was one of the conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1368">We only had a thr -- <span class="INT_SPACE">two bedroom apartment</span>, and my son was already in the second <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1369">So we -- we told the agency we would get a sec -- a third -- another <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for the -- for -- for my daughter eventually, so we looked for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1370">So on -- on the condition that we would, you know, provide a second <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for the -- my daughter, they placed my daughter with us on -- she was still in the -- we were still in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1371">But what we did was we made a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> out of a <span class="INT_SPACE">dinette area</span>, temporarily, for my daughter.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And somewhere after that we -- we did move into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and then we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> for each child.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And meanwhile I was working, and I worked for five years for a <span class="BUILDING">public accounting firm</span>, Touche, and -- whose name changed several times while I was working for them.</sentence><sentence id="1374">But by th -- when I left they were called Touche</sentence><sentence id="1376">Ross.</sentence><sentence id="1377">And after about five years I went with a company called Mark Marietta(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1378">It was shortly after the company was formed, it was a merger of two other companies, that's -- is frequently the case.</sentence><sentence id="1379">And I was with them until I retired really, in 19 -- at the age of 62, in 1992.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1658">A: I don't know if we see each other that wa -- well, obviously we've had some different experiences, but because we were child survivors and also because we were not really directly in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> we weren't in the -- in the Holocaust in that sense, we don't quite have the same experiences that the people who went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had.</sentence><sentence id="1659">Those survivors, I think we feel very different than they do.</sentence><sentence id="1660">So we -- we probably don't feel as different as these other volunteers, although we do feel somewhat different because of -- of our experiences and the things that we -- we saw happening to our families.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1664">Q: Do you feel that you have a greater emotional understanding of what it's about?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1702">Q: And -- and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1703">A: Oh, some of the other volunteers also do.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1704">Q: And you do that just on your own initiative --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1705">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1706">Q: -- to kind of refresh the experience?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1708">A: Yes sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="1709">Or sometimes we have friends who come in, and we" ll go with them, and sometimes we'll accompany them through the exhibit.</sentence><sentence id="1710">But on-only infrequently will we go through.</sentence><sentence id="1711">But we do want to go through periodically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1716">Q: And could you say something about the direct experience that you have with the visitors, what that feels like for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1718">A: Well, of course, in most cases it's -- th -- it's -- it's not ver -- you do -- you don't have too much reaction, but it c -- but periodically you find that there are people who really have some kind of em-emotional experience they want to convey to</sentence><sentence id="1720">56 someone, and they -- they do that, and they come up and they speak to the volunteers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1725">Q: This is an emotional experience that they have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: In the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1727">Q: -- after --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1728">A: Afterwards, they come and -- and -- and they want to speak to somebody about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1730">I guess they just feel they have to get it off their che -- out -- off their chest, or they want to pass it along to someone in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, that -- that -- this experience that they've had.</sentence><sentence id="1731">Just a few months ago I had a very interesting experience.</sentence><sentence id="1732">A woman came in who spoke -- didn't speak too much English, she was German, a German teacher.</sentence><sentence id="1733">And so she had come up to one of the other volunteers who knew that I spoke German, so she brought this woman over.</sentence><sentence id="1734">So we spoke, and she said she was a teacher and she was here on some conference and she wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1735">And afterwards, she came up to me and she s -- was very emotional about what she had seen.</sentence><sentence id="1736">And she said now, she said, I'm really happy that I've seen this, because now no one in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> can tell me that they didn't know what was going on during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1737">She said, and I have to pass this along to my grandchildren and my children.</sentence><sentence id="1738">She said, I want them to know, make sure that they know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1739">So occasionally you get those kind of reactions.</sentence><sentence id="1740">Or people who are just</sentence><sentence id="1742">57 very emotional about what they've seen for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="1743">Either just because the whole exhibit is that way, or they've had some experience in their lives that attaches them to the Holocaust in some way.</sentence><sentence id="1744">Some family member, or they themselves; we frequently get other survivors who come in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and come up to us and tell us a little bit about what they felt when they went through the exhibit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1761">Q: So how has that affected your life the other six days of the week?</sentence><sentence id="1762">Does that make your experiences more intense, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1763">A: I think we feel an attachment now to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and to the -- and to -- to the people who come, because it seems to be an experience that's -- that's important to them in many cases.</sentence><sentence id="1764">And we're very kin -- we're particularly also very interested in seeing all these children that come in, these children's groups, school groups.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1767">Now, some of them, of course, probably don't get much reaction.</sentence><sentence id="1768">You know how children are sometimes, it's just another thing on their list.</sentence><sentence id="1769">But many of them seem to be very interested and do get something positive out of that experience.</sentence><sentence id="1770">And that's always something very worthwhile, when you see that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1775">Q: So when you leave at the end of your duty every Thursday afternoon, how are you usually feeling?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1777">A: Very tired.</sentence><sentence id="1778">Not only fi -- not -- not so much physically all the time, but emotionally sometimes draining.</sentence><sentence id="1779">But -- but we're -- we're -- but I feel good about it,</sentence><sentence id="1781">58 and Jill does too, although she decided to stop the visitors" service work for a couple of reasons; one, it was getting to be physically to -- diff-- hard on her.</sentence><sentence id="1782">She felt that it was too tiring, and she wanted to try something else for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="1783">Not that she was unhappy doing it, it was almost physical, more than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="1784">You know --- even though, you know, a lot of people say well, you're always doing the same thing, and there's no -- but it isn't always the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1785">It isn't always the same thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1795">Q: So when people come up and want to talk to someone and you're it, that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1796">A: Yeah, it's very satisfying.</sentence><sentence id="1797">Or you can answer questions for people.</sentence><sentence id="1798">Lot of people come who have no experience or understanding of what happened in the Holocaust and after they've seen it, or even be -- sometimes before they see it, they have questions, and they want to ask someone, or -- or they want to tell you something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1802">And if you can help them deal with that, or answer their questions, that's very satisfying, cause that <span class="NPIP">place</span> is a place where people should learn.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1804">Q: Is there any more you want to say about that experience before we move on to a new subject?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1806">A: Oh, I think that about covers it.</sentence><sentence id="1807">I think that's the -- the satisfaction we get out of it is -- is -- is -- is dual.</sentence><sentence id="1808">One is satisfying to us because of what we're doing, and it's</sentence><sentence id="1810">59 also satisfying because we feel that that's something we've done for the people that were lost in the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1816">Q: Have you made trips back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1818">A: Well, we made trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1819">And of course, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> and that -- lo-long before we had a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1820">Now that's a very different kind of <span class="BUILDING">institution</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1821">We found that to be emotionally very difficult to handle, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span>, as well.</sentence><sentence id="1822">But I f--I find that I n -- in a way I find the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here easier to handle than I did Yad Vashem for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="1823">I'm not sure what it was, but -- or maybe it was just because the time has passed and I've just adjusted better to handling my emotions in relation to that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1830">Q: Oh, this was the first <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> you had [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1831">A: Yes, yes, and that was many years -- the first time we went was many -- that was many years ago.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And -- and on our other trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we never -- we never went back to the -- to the -- to Yad Vashem, because we found it emotionally so upsetting.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1833">Q: Do you think if it had not been so upsetting, you might have considered going?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1835">A: Maybe, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1836">I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1839">Q: How was it for you otherwise, visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
