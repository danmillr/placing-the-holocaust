<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Was your family religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Well, my father went, you know, in -- in Europe basically most people were religious, at least that's what I was aware of.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: Min-hm, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: So you celebrated the holidays, and -- and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Yes, oh, definitely, this was part of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: -- and Shabbat, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: -- Shabbat, yeah, that was a-all part of life and I felt that that's the way it has to be.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: So, how old were you when you s -- did you start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="49">A: Inever started s --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: You never did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: --I never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until after we were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="53">So basically, at that point I was almost nine years old before I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, without knowing how to read or write.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: So, when the war started, you -- you were on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span>, or you were on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: We were on the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span>, and then the -- the Soviets came in in -- I guess in 1940, maybe, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: And tha -- and of course, and then the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="63">The Soviets, we were a little bit afraid of the Soviets, not to be taken to -- my father was afraid that they'd</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="67">take him to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="68">And we thought that maybe ca -- jer -- he thought that maybe ki-- when the Germans came in, they didn't -- they weren't going to harm Polish Jews, only their own Jews, you know, maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">But of course we discovered very quickly otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="70">And after awhile, which I don't really remember how long, they formed a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and everybody from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> -- our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">And many people came to live with us, and there was a lot of starvation.</sentence><sentence id="72">Cause I remember people basically dying, I don't know how long it took after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was forming, but on our <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> there would be dead people that have -- from hunger, you know.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="73">And they were looking in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage cans</span> for potato peels or onion peels.</sentence><sentence id="74">And we basically, since we were in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, I imagine my -- my parents may have stored some food, so I don't remember being hungry at that point.</sentence><sentence id="75">Maybe I was too young to remember hunger, you know, and then we had three acti -- akejas they call it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="76">The first one we -- we had relatives outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they -- we went there, to outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">My father, I think, remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but my grandfather, when we came back, we discovered my father's father was killed, right across the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">He was shot right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">And then the second one, we went into hiding someplace outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">But the third one, my father brought us to a Christian family, and he -- they said that all workers should come and register, and he felt that he was young and strong, and he was going to register.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="81">And after a day or two, he will come and get us.</sentence><sentence id="82">And it took about a week and he</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="86">never came back.</sentence><sentence id="87">So my mother worried, she took us out and we started walking out -- out of the -- their -- wherever they hid us, in their <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">And they were shotti -- shooting after us, you know, when we -- they saw that we were, you know, Jews, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="89">And we went back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but eventually this akeja must have stopped, or whatever, but they came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they chased us out.</sentence><sentence id="90">Out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">And I was, you know, very young, but my mother told me to grab -- she had a -- her girdle, which she had gold dollars sewn into it -- to take that.</sentence><sentence id="92">As a child I was able to sneak by with that.</sentence><sentence id="93">And this is basically -- that eventually saved our life.</sentence><sentence id="94">And then they made <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judenfrei</span>, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was Judenfrei, but my grandmother on my father's side had survived, and then an aunt, my father's sister.</sentence><sentence id="95">And we went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and we --I guess my mother must have known that across this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, was called the Kinester(ph), there were Jews, were still Jews there.</sentence><sentence id="96">And you -- you were able to get there.</sentence><sentence id="97">So we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> right acro -- from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and hiding in there, and a young student came across.</sentence><sentence id="98">He knew my mother, and he said, you hide, he says, but during the night when the water gets shallow or whatever, he says, I will come and -- and take you across.</sentence><sentence id="99">He carried me across, because I was the youngest one.</sentence><sentence id="100">My brother, my mother, my aunt and my grandmother, they walked across with packages, if they had -- whatever they had.</sentence><sentence id="101">And we came to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potok Zloty</span>, and before we know it, you know, a couple of days later, they made Judenfrei over there.</sentence><sentence id="102">And we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.064504" long="25.383855">Buczacz</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.064504" long="25.383855">Buczacz</span> we lived with a family that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="103">And there were also many</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="107">akejas and I remember that we always had to watch at night, people were watching.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">And I would go out during the day, of course, and play with other children.</sentence><sentence id="109">And right after the akeja I'd come out and they'd say, the children are dead, they're -- they're gone.</sentence><sentence id="110">Or -- and one day I came out and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> full of dead children, with bleed -- blood coming out of the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">You know, when -- so I was always ready, I was afraid I'd be left behind, being the -- the youngest one.</sentence><sentence id="112">So as soon as they -- I'd be -- at night or whatever, I'd be the first one to get dressed and hold onto my mother to go into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="113">And basically after this -- you know, after -- I'm--I'm not sure of how much time passed, they made that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> Judenfrei, and my -- and we had an-another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, my ki -- father's relatives, cousins were there, and they -- I don't how they communicated with my mother, but she decided to go there.</sentence><sentence id="114">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kopyezynce</span> was that name.</sentence><sentence id="115">And we went in -- we stayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="116">And of course then it started over there; the -- the killings started over there.</sentence><sentence id="117">And my f--- relatives" son, they -- he was 17 or 18 years old, with other boys they built a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> from that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in to under the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and we felt it was very safe, you know, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> it was camouflaged, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, and we were there.</sentence><sentence id="118">There were a couple of <span class="BUILDING">akejas</span> there, but this was like the last one.</sentence><sentence id="119">We we -- all went into this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, we were 30 some odd people that went in there.</sentence><sentence id="120">And they must -- they built a <span class="DLF">air</span> -- you know, some type of <span class="DLF">air</span>, to give us air in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">And either the noise or whatever, they discovered that we -- that there was a -- that we -- there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> under there, so they started digging from</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="125">the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> the <span class="DLF">street</span> and came in that <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">And then they realized that there had to be an opening in a -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you know, that we -- how we got in there.</sentence><sentence id="127">So they discovered us on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">They pulled everybody out, and they started throwing hand grenades into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">And basically, I don't know what happened to my mother, she either, you know, went to another part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="130">A -- but I was holding onto my brother.</sentence><sentence id="131">And people died, and the dead bodies fell on top of us.</sentence><sentence id="132">And when it had quieted down, people came to rob, you know, the dead, to see what was there.</sentence><sentence id="133">And they hit my brother over the head with an axe, you know, to tr -- they thought that he was still alive.</sentence><sentence id="134">But I was covered with bodies, so they pulled my foot, and they pulled off my shoe.</sentence><sentence id="135">And basically, I survived with that one shoe on, through the war.</sentence><sentence id="136">And then we -- we -- when -- after we were discovered, we were the only ones, they thought we were already dead, or whatever, they were all dead people.</sentence><sentence id="137">At night we snuck out of there, went into a -- into another <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, out onto a <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">We stayed there for a long time without any food.</sentence><sentence id="139">Being the youngest one, my mother worried, you know, my -- my throat was closing up from not eating or drinking.</sentence><sentence id="140">But there was like a -- a --a rusty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tub</span>, or whatever with the -- with the water was leaking from the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">And she found a straw and made me drink the water with a st -- through a straw, because it was feathers and dirt in that water.</sentence><sentence id="142">And then we were discovered there.</sentence><sentence id="143">But if-- they only robbed us.</sentence><sentence id="144">There were some other people from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> that survived, another three men, I think wi-with us.</sentence><sentence id="145">And -- you know, and they let us -- they --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="149">they told us, this is the end, they're gonna -- going to keep killing until all the Jews are gone, he says.</sentence><sentence id="150">But there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> outside of -- of -- that some Jews are working on the labor -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">To us, of course, it was a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we weren't there very long.</sentence><sentence id="152">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- walled ghetto.</sentence><sentence id="153">But we -- these two men that were with us on that <span class="DLF">roof</span> came down with us and looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go over the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">And they found like an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, I don't know what it was, and my mother was able, and my brother, to get over.</sentence><sentence id="155">They threw me over the -- th -- over the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and we started running away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">And it was -- a man was leading a cow, so he told the guards at the -- the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, the Jews were escaping, and they start -- they shot after us.</sentence><sentence id="157">Well, we were able to get to -- I think one of the man got -- you know, was shot, but we were able to get into the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, and there was -- the wheat was very high, and we hid there for a couple of days in -- my mother had the feeling that we were heading towards that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> where Jews were still working.</sentence><sentence id="158">We got there and we -- we s -- we got there at night and there was nobody, the Jews used to run away at night.</sentence><sentence id="159">They were always afraid that at night they'd come and get them.</sentence><sentence id="160">We were in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that wasn't quite finished yet.</sentence><sentence id="161">They came to rob us again, and they -- my mother had -- at this point she had slipped the gold dollars into her shoes, she wore a high, like a boot, and they touched her boot that it was there.</sentence><sentence id="162">So they hit her to get off the boot and she refused.</sentence><sentence id="163">She said, we'll scream.</sentence><sentence id="164">They were allowed to kill Jews, but they weren't allowed to rob.</sentence><sentence id="165">So they got scared and ran away.</sentence><sentence id="166">And then morning came, and my</sentence></p><p><sentence id="169">0 mother went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and ta -- find out if she could work there.</sentence><sentence id="170">And the man that was in charge of labor -- my mother happened to have been a beautiful blonde woman, so he picked her she could wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in her -- in his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">And he started talking to her, and he said, you know, you could pass as a Polish woman.</sentence><sentence id="172">So she says, but I have two children.</sentence><sentence id="173">So he said, two children, he says, do you have a -- so she says, I have a son and a daughter.</sentence><sentence id="174">Says well, no son, I cannot help you with a son, but with a daughter.</sentence><sentence id="175">But a couple of days later he said to her, I--if you have any money left, he says, if you have any money, I have a friend that would be willing to hide you <span class="NPIP">outside</span> into -- in a -- <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in another <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">And my mother said she didn't -- she was afraid to say that she had the money with her.</sentence><sentence id="177">But she said, I have money in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and I will sneak back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and dig it out.</sentence><sentence id="178">She wanted to make sure that he meant it.</sentence><sentence id="179">And sure enough, he did have a friend, he sends a worker from that other <span class="DLF">farm</span> to pick us up, you know, to -- to take us -- he wanted gold dollars, he didn't want -- so we were very lucky to have gold and not paper money.</sentence><sentence id="180">And they took us to this other f-- to this other <span class="DLF">farm</span>, or to -- you know what -- what it was, it was -- was a lot of people working for him, he was like the boss.</sentence><sentence id="181">And they put us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, they -- it was an empty <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="182">And there was a man that was assigned to bring us food or take out our waste, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="183">And he -- the man didn't tell us that he was Jewish passing himself off as a--he was the bookkeeper on that <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">But he was a Jew, and he passed himself off as a-- you know, as a non Jew, but he was the one to provide us whenever he</sentence></p><p><sentence id="187">1 could.</sentence><sentence id="188">I mean, mostly it was potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="189">And being the youngest one after we were there for eight months, and then they started -- rumors were he ki -- brought back rumors saying that the Russians were coming, that the Russians were winning the war, and they were coming closer.</sentence><sentence id="190">And the partisans were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, we were hoping we'd get liberated.</sentence><sentence id="191">But eventually, of course, the -- the war came closer, and I think that they -- that somebody must have discovered that there may be Jews in there.</sentence><sentence id="192">So they moved us to a still.</sentence><sentence id="193">But the -- and the still in -- these big barrels in a still, and -- and then we went up to the -- the <span class="DLF">roof</span>, I don't -- and they were going to bomb the Germans when they were leaving, they were going to bomb that <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> because they didn't want the Russians to get ahold of the liquor that was in there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">And we heard them talking <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you know, that this is next, they were going to [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="195">And then the bombs started falling all around, they ran away.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">And we didn't really know if we were -- if the Russians were coming, if the rai -- so we stayed there for quite awhile with no food or anything, because they -- they couldn't bring it to us over there.</sentence><sentence id="197">Eventually they came and they told us you're liberated, you're free.</sentence><sentence id="198">And at that point I was swollen, my stomach and my feet were swollen.</sentence><sentence id="199">And we got <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we hitched a ride with the Russian soldiers as they were advancing to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">And -- and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they were -- some Jews started coming out of -- you know, there were a couple of families came out of hiding, and we stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="201">So basically, that was our liberation.</sentence><sentence id="202">And then we started running because the war was going on right near us.</sentence><sentence id="203">We tried to go closer to</sentence></p><p><sentence id="206">2 the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">And other people were coming out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, and they had typhus, and my mother and I both got typhus.</sentence><sentence id="208">And we -- that <span class="NPIP">part</span> is completely like way -- vague in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="209">I know that I couldn't walk, that I lost my hair.</sentence><sentence id="210">But L, you know -- and eventually, as it quieted down, we worked ourselves back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, hoping that there would somebody be left, somebody would be -- you know, we didn't know what -- the fate of my father, we just --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: -- knew that he didn't come back, and my mother's sisters, grandmothers, everybody.</sentence><sentence id="213">You know, so we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and some Jews finally unfil -- you know, came back.</sentence><sentence id="214">Some of the Jews that -- we stayed there for awhile, and that's when the first -- when it got a little bit -- they wanted the children to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: -- so that was my first experience to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> at that point --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: -- but it was the Russians -- within weeks they changed it to <span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">And then we ha -- we -- since we were Polish citizens, we -- we were able
