could survive.</sentence><sentence id="181">And...uh...She went in this state in the middle...she didn't want to show it to us, I think, how...how desperate she was.</sentence><sentence id="182">And so she went to...to sit on a...a...in a little place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and I only know by her story what happened.</sentence><sentence id="183">I didn't see it.</sentence><sentence id="184">Uh...uh...Secretary from the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> arrived and asked her, "Aren't you the

making of the newspaper, and we were able to live from his income and soon we had...uh...a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and...uh...my brother went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and...uh...everything seemed...uh...to pick up except that we were very worried about our family that we had left behind.</sentence><sentence id="194">My father...my

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="489">A: Uh...We had...we had...uh...the Germans advanced.</sentence><sentence id="490">In the beginning, it was called the Drole de Guerre because nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="491">And then in...in the springtime, the Germans advanced and...uh...the unexpected happened.</sentence><sentence id="492">They weren't...they weren't....they were victorious.</sentence><sentence id="493">Nobody had imagined that.</sentence><sentence id="494">They conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="495">They conquered <span class="REGION">Northern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="496">And...uh..we couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="497">At one point, you could hear the...the cannons and...uh...and...uh...the...the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and everything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were dark...of course, darkened, and you could hear the bombs.</sentence><sentence id="498">And it was frightening, and people started running away.</sentence><sentence id="499">Most of the French people had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the...in <span class="REGION">Southern France</span> somewhere and or grandparents and knew where to go, but people like us didn't know where to go, so we couldn't make any plans, but also we couldn't make any plans because the police did not let us travel.</sentence><sentence id="500">And...uh...we were told by our conciege that we should not even think of leaving our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, because she would...uh...notify the police.</sentence><sentence id="501">And...uh..so we were under...under observation, and we didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="502">In the end, when the pressure became so...I mean...by pressure, I mean we realized the Germans are going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in 2 days.</sentence><sentence id="503">Uh...We decided we are going to leave.</sentence><sentence id="504">And...uh...we didn't know where my brother were...was, and nor where my father was.</sentence><sentence id="505">Uh...We...we assumed that my father was...uh...somewhere fighting perhaps or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>, and my brother equally and...uh...but we didn't know where they were, and we didn't know where to go and we had no means of going any <span class="NPIP">place</span> except the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">So we decided the following: My mother would go on foot.</sentence><sentence id="507">She would make auto stop, and I would follow her wherever she would go.</sentence><sentence id="508">And...uh...so I wouldn't have a...a <span class="NPIP">destination</span> except the destination where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that would accept her would take her.</sentence><sentence id="509">That would be my destiny and our destiny.</sentence><sentence id="510">And it...we...we didn't imagine the difficulty of carrying out this plan, but we went to the Port d'Orleans in the south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, which was uh...group.</sentence><sentence id="511">already filled with people leaving and it's very difficult to even recognize the layout.</sentence><sentence id="512">And...uh...But quickly I got a...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="513">I...My mother was too shy to do the auto stopping herself, and...uh...so I did it for her.</sentence><sentence id="514">And then I put her into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and then I quickly asked the driver where he was going as he rolled away, and he said, Rambouillet and so I took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and all I knew is...was my mother was on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="515">And as I bicycled I realized I don't know where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span> I am going to meet her.</sentence><sentence id="516">Also there were more than one <span class="DLF">road</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span>, so she could be in the north, or east or west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">Fortunately, by almost a miracle I found her at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rambouillet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">I was looking at every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I</sentence><sentence id="520">can't tell you today how come I found her.</sentence><sentence id="521">I found her.</sentence><sentence id="522">It's not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="523">And...uh...We stayed the night there at a very poor <span class="BUILDING">woman's house</span> who was very...uh...uh...to whom we were very thankful for taking us in.</sentence><sentence id="524">We slept at her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the next day, the voyage started all over again.</sentence><sentence id="525">But we had learned to be a little more precise about our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="526">So we said when the...the next person says where he is going, we will meet at the Marie, at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, because every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> has a <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="527">So the next time, I...uh...I think it was...we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chauteaudun</span>, and then we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chauteaudun</span>.</sentence><sentence id="528">And it was at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and again we were very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="529">We met somebody who offered us...uh...a...a place in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="530">And the next day, my mother...we went to...oh, I think...no, the next... Excuse me, I... think I am mixing it up.</sentence><sentence id="531">The next day we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chatres</span>, and there's a... Yes.</sentence><sentence id="532">And somehow I went much faster than my mother because of the....the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were all clogged with people and...uh...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> could go in and out and the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were stuck.</sentence><sentence id="533">So, | arrived at...uh...Chatres earlier than my mother and...uh...I waited for her.</sentence><sentence id="534">And then...as she came, at the moment she came, there was...uh...uh...bombing attack, and we had to run into the <span class="INT_SPACE">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="535">And I remember taking my mother's hand and leaving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and taking my mother's hand and running into the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="536">And when we came out of the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> 2, 3 hours later, there was two policemen standing next to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and they said, "Is this your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="537">And I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="538">And they said, "You're a German spy."</sentence><sentence id="539">And I said, "I am not a German spy."</sentence><sentence id="540">And they said, "What's this?"</sentence><sentence id="541">And showed me..in my...I had taken along in my...my musette, I had taken along Emest's passport.</sentence><sentence id="542">I had taken along Goethe's Faust, and I had...and something else that indicated to them that I am...I had some German origins and they arrested my mother and myself and put us in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="543">And...uh...I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="544">I said, "What...what are you doing?I mean L...We're just trying to flee from the Germans, and you say Iam a German spy."</sentence><sentence id="545">I couldn't believe it, but they didn't listen.</sentence><sentence id="546">And...uh...somehow...uh...at 5 o'clock in the morning, they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and they said, "The Germans are coming.</sentence><sentence id="547">The Germans are coming.</sentence><sentence id="548">Run away."</sentence><sentence id="549">And I took my mother, and we ran away, literally.</sentence><sentence id="550">I even found my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, and...uh...then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateaudun</span>.</sentence><sentence id="551">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chateaudun</span>, the next day...we...the next day we...we said we are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span> if possible because we were depending on...we couldn't say at anytime where we wanted to go, only where....where we could go.</sentence><sentence id="552">Right?</sentence><sentence id="553">So, I...when my mother got into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vendome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">So I was supposed to meet her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vendome</span> and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vendome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="555">And at that time the...the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were clear and I expected my mother to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vendome</span> before me because with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> you go slower than with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, but she wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="556">And I was worried and...uh...but I didn't have much time for worrying because a bombardment started again and...uh... a man came to me and said you have to...to leave where you are in front of the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> to go and go into shelter.</sentence><sentence id="557">And I said, "I can't go into <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">I am waiting for my mother."</sentence><sentence id="559">He said, "You can't stay here.</sentence><sentence id="560">It's not allowed.</sentence><sentence id="561">You have to go into the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>."</sentence><sentence id="562">So I put a big piece of paper with my mother's name and telling her that I was in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>, and then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">And when I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>, the piece of paper was gone and my mother wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="564">So I couldn't understand anything, and I was pretty upset because my mother perhaps had seen it, but she hadn't come to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> or she hadn't waited for me.</sentence><sentence id="565">What was I supposed to do?</sentence><sentence id="566">She wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="567">And the Germans were going to come.</sentence><sentence id="568">So in my being</sentence><sentence id="570">so upset, I...uh...looked at the....I don't think I had a map, but I must have looked at something that shown me that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of my father was only 3 or 4 miles away from where I was.</sentence><sentence id="571">So I decided that I'm going to see if I cannot find my father and then come back to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vendome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="572">Or go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span> where we said we would be together this evening.</sentence><sentence id="573">So I left a note again at the Marie saying that I am on the way to look for my father.</sentence><sentence id="574">If it is late, I will go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span> and find her at the Marie in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="575">And when I came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my father was supposed to be, there was...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was empty.</sentence><sentence id="576">And I found one officer there who packed his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and he said Yes, your father was here about 4 hours ago.</sentence><sentence id="577">He...he went with his...uh...group.</sentence><sentence id="578">Uh...He went into this and this direction, and you probably can catch them if you bicycle fast.</sentence><sentence id="579">So I was torn between trying to find my father and going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span> as I had promised my mother.</sentence><sentence id="580">And I thought I would find my father for sure, but I wouldn't find my mother perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="581">Perhaps I wouldn't find my mother.</sentence><sentence id="582">And so I decided to go to where my father was.</sentence><sentence id="583">And I bicycled and bicycled and bicycled and then finally, I realized I was bicycling...bicycling in the wrong direction toward the Germans and...uh...after I had bicycled for 4 hours and not found my father.... I don't know whether I had gotten the wrong directions or whether L..I can't... can't say what went wrong there.</sentence><sentence id="584">Anyway after 4 hours bicycling, I was at the end of my physical possibilities.</sentence><sentence id="585">And I propped myself against a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and...and passed out.</sentence><sentence id="586">And then when I came to myself, I was surrounded by four Belgian soldiers who gave me sugar and fed me sugar and then I woke up and...uh...they said...uh...you'll have to move from here.</sentence><sentence id="587">The Germans are coming instantly.</sentence><sentence id="588">And I said, "I am looking for my father.</sentence><sentence id="589">I have to go to this other <span class="NPIP">direction</span>."</sentence><sentence id="590">They said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="591">Your...your father is not there.</sentence><sentence id="592">Your father couldn't be there."</sentence><sentence id="593">Then I said, "Okay, then I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span> and find my mother.</sentence><sentence id="594">And they said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="595">We go with you."</sentence><sentence id="596">And we took the <span class="DLF">road</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span>, and as we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blois</span>, the policeman said, "You cannot cross the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="597">We are going to blow it up."</sentence><sentence id="598">And I was on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Loire</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> was on the side of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> they were going.</sentence><sentence id="599">In other words, I couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="600">And...uh...I...L..[ nearly threw myself on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, but they took me off and...uh...they said, "You can't do this.</sentence><sentence id="601">You can't go across."</sentence><sentence id="602">I said, "I have to find my mother."</sentence><sentence id="603">And they said, "Your mother is not there, because we are going to blow this whole thing up."</sentence><sentence id="604">And so L...this is why I lost my mother too.</sentence><sentence id="605">And...uh...they blew up the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="606">The...the bombs rained down.</sentence><sentence id="607">The whole thing looked like in a...looked so surrealistic.</sentence><sentence id="608">The fire, the bombs, the everything.</sentence><sentence id="609">And...uh...I was lost.</sentence><sentence id="610">And...uh...] went to the...uh...to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and...uh...cried, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="611">And then the...the Belgian soldier said, "If you want to go, you could go down south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with us.</sentence><sentence id="612">We are going down there."</sentence><sentence id="613">So I said, "Fine.</sentence><sentence id="614">I'll join you."</sentence><sentence id="615">And this was very lucky for me, because they were very...uh...dependable fellows and I had learned in the meantime that to go with four fellows was safer than to go with one.</sentence><sentence id="616">And...uh...we...this must have been....I don't know what day this was anymore, but any...anyway, we went to this...toward the south and bicycled and bicycled.</sentence><sentence id="617">And one day...uh...where we stayed overnight...
