<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: I found out after the war that she was involved in a...in an underground group that was smuggling people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to the West to safety.</sentence><sentence id="40">And I found out about it in a very strange way.</sentence><sentence id="41">There is a psychiatrist in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, a Doctor Pearl who was involved in the Nuremberg trials as an American psychiatrist, and he is married to a lady who knew my mother from those times, who knew about her underground activities and knew about the whole group that they were caught.</sentence><sentence id="42">And then I found out from practically the only surviving relative of mine, an Aunt, a sister of my mother, that my mother was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and was executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">But I don't have any other details and I don't have any documents about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Then you and your father...where did you and your father go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: My father we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">My father, I understand, was quite desperate because, of course, he couldn't find any work and he was practically just waiting for the opportunity still to get out and one day in March or April 1942, he got an invitation to report to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, that he will be taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">So the night before that happened, he wrote a note which I have...was given to me after the war, where he authorizes my aunt to hand me over to a Jewish family in that small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> that was supposed to be protected from deportation because they had what was called either the yellow or the white exemption which could have been bought from the Slovak government.</sentence><sentence id="60">This yellow/white exemption indication that the person is important for the Slovak economy.</sentence><sentence id="61">This was already ,<span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> did not exist anymore, the Slovak 01:05: State, a puppet state put together by Hitler, and Hitler installed the Slovak fascist government.</sentence><sentence id="62">The head of it was Monsieur Tiso.</sentence><sentence id="63">This was already the Slovak State.</sentence><sentence id="64">So when they took my father I still stayed with my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="65">A few weeks later, they came to take my aunt and her husband and the maid.</sentence><sentence id="66">They had a maid.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: What was her name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agnes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">Agnes Rebunska.</sentence><sentence id="83">And she woke me up and I remember this...this actually [is] one of the first recollections that I have about this time.</sentence><sentence id="84">She just sent me out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">And she pointed the direction to me, the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where her parents lived.</sentence><sentence id="86">I basically knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because she would take me there over the weekends.</sentence><sentence id="87">So I ran to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">On the <span class="DLF">road</span> somebody picked me up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, brought me to her parents, and from there on based on that authorization that my father wrote just before he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> I was given to this family who had these exemptions, the yellow/white exemptions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: When Agnes Acnes got you out of there, and this is one of your first recollections, remember how you...what you saw that would be.</sentence><sentence id="98">Did you have any feelings about it at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Feelings I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="102">I remember thoughts that it seemed to me too far.</sentence><sentence id="103">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> seemed to me too far, and that I was very relieved when one of the young men from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who was on his way either to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or to a job in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> took me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, turned around, brought me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and handed me over to the parents.</sentence><sentence id="104">I recall much better when I was then brought to this family.</sentence><sentence id="105">The name was Pollack.</sentence><sentence id="106">They knew my father.</sentence><sentence id="107">And when I arrived there they had a 19 year old son and they asked me</sentence><sentence id="109">to feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">This will be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">Incidentally, from this family's <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> I was watching when my father left for the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to report to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">They told him that he will go to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaki</span>, which was just...I don't know, maybe 25 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">And I also recall that people were telling him, "Mr. Reiss, don't go.</sentence><sentence id="114">You are going to be taken somewhere else, not to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>."</sentence><sentence id="115">And he just dismissed this and I remember standing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and waving to him.</sentence><sentence id="116">It was the last time I saw him.</sentence><sentence id="117">And after that I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">I was a first grader in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> which was just around the corner from this <span class="BUILDING">family's house</span> so that my last recollection of seeing my father...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: You had no notion that that was the last time you would see your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="143">No.</sentence><sentence id="144">Neither did my father, because my father wrote a card which I have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">I have it framed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, smuggled it out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and the card says in German, "We are full of optimism, and we are looking forward to all that's to come and we will stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaki</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">And there and then he sends regards to several friends so he did not know, and of course, I had no idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: And you're with the Pollack family.</sentence><sentence id="153">Can you tell us what happened them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: The Pollack family.</sentence><sentence id="157">And 6 weeks, maybe 6 weeks later, with this yellow exemption or white exemption disregarded, we went to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zilina</span>, which is about, 100 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> and also in <span class="REGION">northern Slovakia</span>, but it's also very close to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">And from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is a very short distance.</sentence><sentence id="159">I don't know...maybe a hundred miles maybe, a little bit more, but certainly not much more.</sentence><sentence id="160">There I already recall that we were very cramped in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">And I was 7 and I was looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> being filled with people and I remember I always enjoyed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was always something I was looking forward to...incidentally to this day.</sentence><sentence id="163">And I was just waiting..."when will our turn come," so I did not view it as something negative.</sentence><sentence id="164">I wanted to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride.</sentence><sentence id="165">I got different feelings when I saw that they closed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was just standing there and some people were screaming for water.</sentence><sentence id="166">And also what frightened me, there wasn't...there wasn't one German.</sentence><sentence id="167">This was all administered by the Slovaks, by the so called Hlinka guard.</sentence><sentence id="168">Was the fascist uniformed members of the Hlinka party.</sentence><sentence id="169">And one day I was wondering through this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">There were wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and one of these Hlinka guards...I don't know whether they took pity on me.</sentence><sentence id="171">I don't know what I looked like.</sentence><sentence id="172">But he invited me into a large <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and there were all these knapsacks and there was food, canned food.</sentence><sentence id="173"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sardines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">And there were lemons I remember.</sentence><sentence id="175">And he said, "Take what you want."</sentence><sentence id="176">And I was...I believed quite a street smart kid, so I put some string around my pants and I stuffed the pants with all kinds of foods, cans, sardines.</sentence><sentence id="177">And I brought it to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where we were staying.</sentence><sentence id="180">And I remember a great feeling of satisfaction because I distributed food.</sentence><sentence id="181">There wasn't starvation really there.</sentence><sentence id="182">We were fed.</sentence><sentence id="183">I believe twice a day we were getting some soup.</sentence><sentence id="184">And this was basically just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where people arrived, loaded in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and sent on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: How did you get out of there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Well, this man...this Pollack was a dentist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">He had a brother named Arthur.</sentence><sentence id="219">Arthur was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> which is the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and he was by profession a printer and he had a very influential friend and professional colleague from the printing business whose name was Shajno Mach (ph.).</sentence><sentence id="220">He was a minister of interior in the fascist government of Monsignor Tiso in charge of solving the Jewish question of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">And Shajno Mach and Arthur Pollack were friends, drinking friends, card playing friends, fellow printers.</sentence><sentence id="222">And Arthur was sort of a bon vivant as a I always understood, a womanizer.</sentence><sentence id="223">All kinds of vices, but he was also very close friend of Shajno Mach.</sentence><sentence id="224">So Arthur, as I understand, went to <span class="BUILDING">Shaino Mach</span> and he arranged that we were released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">I remember that one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> showed up and we were let out.</sentence><sentence id="226">And the magic word was a phonogram.</sentence><sentence id="227">| did not know what a phonogram was, but I can still visualize it.</sentence><sentence id="228">It was a white piece of paper with something written on it, and it had a red stripe across.</sentence><sentence id="229">And this was the paper that gave the orders to let us go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Did you have any idea that you are being rescued from death by that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="246">No.</sentence><sentence id="247">Quite the con...I think I was...I was... | must have had mixed feelings.</sentence><sentence id="248">I don't know exactly, but I know that part of the feeling was there will be no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride.</sentence><sentence id="249">So that was the negative feeling.</sentence><sentence id="250">But I already saw some misery.</sentence><sentence id="251">I remember and I can still visualize it.</sentence><sentence id="252">There was a man laying on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">There were many people around him.</sentence><sentence id="254">And it bothered me terribly because this man was not 01:15: supposed to be there.</sentence><sentence id="255">He was ill.</sentence><sentence id="256">He was supposed to be in some kind of a therapeutic environment.</sentence><sentence id="257">I couldn't verbalize it at that time in this way, but I just remember that this was disturbing.</sentence><sentence id="258">The other disturbing thing was that we had extremely small <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we were sleeping on straw.</sentence><sentence id="259">And this was again something that doesn't happen to you when you are in comfortable times.</sentence><sentence id="260">So it must have been a mixed bag but that I am not going to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride that bothered me.</sentence><sentence id="261">So we got out of there and we knew that we have to go into a semi-hiding.</sentence><sentence id="262">So we went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> (ph) which is in <span class="REGION">eastern Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">And there we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">Pollack could no longer practice as a independent dentist, but he took employment with a Jewish dentist.</sentence><sentence id="265">It was 1942.</sentence><sentence id="266">And we stayed in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> til 1943.</sentence><sentence id="267">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="268">And then some how things became bad.</sentence><sentence id="269">Was either end of 1943 or even the beginning of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="270">and Pollack decided that we have to go into hiding again.</sentence><sentence id="271">Not complete hiding, but just out of <span class="NPIP">site</span> into some <span class="NPIP">location</span> where we will be safer than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> which is a quite Slovak</sentence><sentence id="273">conditions, quite a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">Let's say it had 20,000 inhabitants.</sentence><sentence id="275">And he made a very unfortunate decision.</sentence><sentence id="276">He decided together with two extended families, maybe some 35 people, that all of us are going to go back to <span class="REGION">Western Slovakia</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span> (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="277">near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Hadn't some of you become nominally Lutherans at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: We came Lutherans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="318">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span> we...we attended <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">We got papers that we were Lutherans.</sentence><sentence id="320">I still have the baptismal certificate.</sentence><sentence id="321">And it was a serious situation, yet it was a funny situation too because Pollack was brought up in a Yeshiva and was brought up as an Orthodox Jew.</sentence><sentence id="322">And to see this man forcing me and his wife to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran service</span> was quite a funny sight.</sentence><sentence id="323">And on top of everything, he would also use every opportunity and go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">I don't think it was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="325">It was a stiebel.</sentence><sentence id="326">It was a <span class="INT_SPACE">prayer hall</span>, but nevertheless came, so the same man who on a Sunday would piously sit in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with us, on a Friday night on a Shabat or on a holiday would put on his talith and pray in a stiebel.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: Were you aware of the incongruity of that at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="341">Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="342">I was 8 and I remember I had a friend there whose name was Thury, who I will tell you a very sad story about Thury.</sentence><sentence id="343">His name was Arthur.</sentence><sentence id="344">His nickname was Thury.</sentence><sentence id="345">And I remember we were somehow discussing it and had a good time discussing the funny aspect of that.</sentence><sentence id="346">Because his family had nothing to do with the Lutherans.</sentence><sentence id="347">We were 01:19: the ones.</sentence><sentence id="348">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="349">I don't know how it happened, but we were the ones who attended the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran services</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">So now Pollack took this maybe 35 peoople to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span>, and it was a very stupid decision because first of all, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> alone had many Hlinka guards.</sentence><sentence id="351">And one evening somebody came to tell us...somebody from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, "Listen, tomorrow the Nazis are coming with the Hlinka guards."</sentence><sentence id="352">There were already Germans in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="353">And they're going to take everybody."</sentence><sentence id="354">And Pollack did not want to do anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="355">We were urged to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">Pollack had a son who was 19, 20 by that time.</sentence><sentence id="357">Maybe 21 by that time.</sentence><sentence id="358">And he said, "If you don't want to go, I am taking the child (meaning me) and my mother and we are asking anybody else who wants to leave to leave with us into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>."</sentence><sentence id="359">By the way, Pollack also brought to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> his brother, the baby that was about 4 months old.</sentence><sentence id="360">All in all there were maybe over 40 people.</sentence><sentence id="361">So the son of his, Marcel took us.</sentence><sentence id="362">He finally... he relented.</sentence><sentence id="363">His brother went too with a child that was my age, and his third brother stayed with his 4 month old child.</sentence><sentence id="364">So only the two families, we left at night for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">Sunday morning, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> appeared with Hlinka guards, with Nazis, loaded up everybody and took them to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nemchita</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">A few miles from this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> they had to dig out their own <span class="DLF">grave</span> and they were all executed there.</sentence><sentence id="367">The children were not...they're not even shot.</sentence><sentence id="368">They were just</sentence><sentence id="370">buried alive.</sentence><sentence id="371">And I know that because after the war Pollack went to the exhumation.</sentence><sentence id="372">And I was there too.</sentence><sentence id="373">I was on the side.</sentence><sentence id="374">I did not see the act in itself, and I know that that was the conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="375">The children were not even killed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: Did you know about what had happened, though, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sharfia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="417">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="418">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="419">And incidently, this Thury whom I mentioned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bardell</span>, we had a fight shortly after we arrived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, the two of us, and either I pushed him or he fell and he had quite a large wound on his leg.</sentence><sentence id="420">And when they exhumed him, he still had the bandages on his leg.</sentence><sentence id="421">Well, now they are buried in a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> near this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: At the time this event took place, you and the Pollacks were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>...in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, so you had escaped this and you heard about it after you returned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="431">Q: You weren't directly involved?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="468">Linka was a maid at <span class="BUILDING">Leonhardy's house</span> and she saw a situation and she offered that she will take us at night to the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from where they took these 35 to 40 people and that we can hide in their <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="469">And this is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="470">Linka was about 25 years old.</sentence><sentence id="471">She took us and we were hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we would have survived the war there, but Simon Pollack ran out of cash.</sentence><sentence id="472">He was paying Linka's father so that he can get some food.</sentence><sentence id="473">But he ran out of cash and Linka's father said, "Look it is...1 don't know.</sentence><sentence id="474">But now it's maybe August 44.</sentence><sentence id="475">Said, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="476">The war will end and you will pay me," but Pollack concluded for some reason he has to pay.</sentence><sentence id="477">Otherwise we are in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="478">Whether he assumed that they won't keep us without money, which I think was the wrong conclusion or whether the man did not have money to go and buy food, which I don't think was the case because the man was growing his food and I remember they were slaughtering a pig while we were there hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="479">And I remember big disputes between him and his brother.</sentence><sentence id="480">They really had fights there.</sentence><sentence id="481">They had fights that necessitated the separation of the two families in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> under the worst of circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="482">So he asked his brother whether he has has cash and his brother told him no, he does not.</sentence><sentence id="483">So Pollack since he was a dentist, he was missing some teeth and before we went into hiding from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbell</span>, he created some removable dental work out of gold.</sentence><sentence id="484">And he said, "I have this gold here.</sentence><sentence id="485">I am going to send Linka's brother to sell it, and we'll have money.</sentence><sentence id="486">So Linka's brother took the gold, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span>, got drunk, told somebody that here he has the gold that the Jews who are in hiding in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> are selling, and he must have realized what he has done because he came back running to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he said what he had done.</sentence><sentence id="487">So in a hurry it was at night, we picked ourselves up, run back into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: I don't...must have been a few weeks.</sentence><sentence id="513">And we ran there and there was sort of a small <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> that belonged to one of the villagers.</sentence><sentence id="514">So that's where we went.</sentence><sentence id="515">That's where we were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="516">And what I remember a big bang and the tiles that covered the <span class="DLF">roof</span> broke up.</sentence><sentence id="517">And then there was banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they dragged us out and all I remember seeing: Hlinka guards, some behind machine guns and laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">I remember 3 or 4 SS men in uniforms and they were dragging us out from this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and as we came out, one of the Hlinka guards said, "You are going to dig a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and Pollack became hysterical and so did his brother.</sentence><sentence id="519">The women were very calm, and the two boys...the two of us, we were very calm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: Did you have any idea what the implication of that was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="531">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="532">At that time I knew exactly what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="536">Q: Let me interrupt for a second.</sentence><sentence id="537">At this point, you were about...a boy of 9 years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="545">Q: How much awareness did you have and what were your feelings up to this point of everything that had happened to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: In my life, it's a very significant moment.</sentence><sentence id="548">That's the first time I remember thinking about a supernatural being, so there's God.</sentence><sentence id="549">And I was so calm that...Pollack's wife told me that I was barefooted.</sentence><sentence id="550">She said, "Put on shoes."</sentence><sentence id="551">And I said, "Why would I need shoes?"</sentence><sentence id="552">I remember the thought was, "How preposterous that she should ask me to put on shoes.</sentence><sentence id="553">In a short while later we won't be any more."</sentence><sentence id="554">I remember this thought very vividly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="563">Q: You knew...you knew that you are going to die at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="565">A: That we are going to die.</sentence><sentence id="566">The second thing I remember that they were throwing out... Oh, actually I found out what happened.</sentence><sentence id="567">Why did those tiles on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> break?</sentence><sentence id="568">They threw a grenade.</sentence><sentence id="569">It did not explode.</sentence><sentence id="570">So one of the SS men went upstairs and was throwing our belongings down.</sentence><sentence id="571">One of them was a sort of an attache case that broke open while it was coming down from the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and it was full of bank notes and it belonged to the brother of Pollack.</sentence><sentence id="572">He had plenty of money, but said he didn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="573">That means had he said he has money, we would not have been in that predicament.</sentence><sentence id="574">We would have been in hiding.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="585">Q: He didn't let his brother know at the time his brother was trying to pawn the gold tooth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="587">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="588">And he wouldn't share the money.</sentence><sentence id="589">So we are going to die.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="593">Q: Would you express that.</sentence><sentence id="594">The fact that I've just said, the fact about Pollack's brother's behavior and its effects.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="597">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="598">He was asked whether he has any money and he said he doesn't have.</sentence><sentence id="599">Had he said he has money...had he just lent it to his brother, we would have been safe because I remember the number of bank notes and the bank notes were in thousand crown denominations.</sentence><sentence id="600">That would have saved us.</sentence><sentence id="601">So as we were standing there and the man got hysterical, suddenly somebody came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>, a Nazi, and gave instructions.</sentence><sentence id="602">I did not hear him what he was saying, but it was obvious because they stopped everything and they took us down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">Later we found out that the instruction was to take us down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span>, which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">county town</span>, into the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and to find out from us where the Partisans are.</sentence><sentence id="604">That we must know because we were caught in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: So you were saved then because they thought you had information about the Partisans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="618">A: Precisely.</sentence><sentence id="619">So they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and I remember sitting next to...there were maybe just a handful of SS men.</sentence><sentence id="620">The rest were Hlinka guards.</sentence><sentence id="621">And this SS man gave me something to eat, and I remember touching his gun and he sort of showed it to me.</sentence><sentence id="622">At that time, we already knew what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nenchita</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">And my thought was they are taking us somewhere else for the same purpose as they took Thurie and all the 40 people around him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="630">Q: They had all been killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nenchita</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: You say that there is no more lightness.</sentence><sentence id="666">Is this kind of a turning point in the whole experience?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: It was a dark moment because later on optimism again surfaced.</sentence><sentence id="670">Hope again surfaced, but at that time it was just bleak, dark, no hope.</sentence><sentence id="671">The next day, somebody opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="672">It was a Hlinka guard, and in a very vulgar way asked us to use the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="673">He used very descriptive language to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and what to do there in a Slovak---in the Slovak language.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: What did he actually say?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="681">A: He said, ??..</sentence><sentence id="682">That means go and do number | and do number 2.</sentence><sentence id="683">Short while later, a man</sentence><sentence id="685">0 came and brought in some food.</sentence><sentence id="686">And Pollack looked at him and said, 01:37: "Aren't you Mr. Kopsa?"</sentence><sentence id="687">And sure enough he was.</sentence><sentence id="688">The non-Jewish prisoner...I don't know for what reason...I think he was a Czech originally and that might have been the reason that he was in a <span class="BUILDING">Slovak prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="689">And that was the first spark of lightness again.</sentence><sentence id="690">We knew somebody who is in a position of power in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and we know him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="705">Q: How did Mr. Pollack know him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="707">A: Must have been a patient of his.</sentence><sentence id="708">I don't know exactly how.</sentence><sentence id="709">I think he was a patient of his who used to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> to take a cure.</sentence><sentence id="710"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piestany</span> is a <span class="DLF">spa</span>, quite a well known <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> for treating rheumatism.</sentence><sentence id="711">And then just a day or so later, Pollack was called by the commandant of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="712">I believe his name was Cunsa.</sentence><sentence id="713">I am almost sure it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cunsa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">And he told Pollack...
