<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="857">A: Yes, she met us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="858">She had two kids, beautiful, beautiful, two boys and -- but you know, she wasn't a wealthy woman, so she took us in to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, she had a <span class="INT_SPACE">one bedroom apartment</span>, walking up three flights.</sentence><sentence id="859">But she was so happy to have us there and we were so happy to be there together.</sentence><sentence id="860">I remember we slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that closed up, you know, because she couldn't keep it open, then the kids wouldn't have where to play.</sentence><sentence id="861">But it was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="862">I mean, you know, she was just wonderful, she was just wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="863">And, you know, I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> but I saw that I had to go and provide for myself.</sentence><sentence id="864">You know, you couldn't help seeing it.</sentence><sentence id="865">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night and I went to look -- actually, I</sentence><sentence id="867">a February 21, 2001 think what really saved me from not mourning there forever is because I knew I have to get out and get a job.</sentence><sentence id="868">And so I tried getting a job, and you know, I wasn't trained for anything, and I -- I -- although I-I-I was learning how to speak English for n -- for close to a year, but still -- 1 understood most of it but I couldn't speak it too well.</sentence><sentence id="869">So there are so many drawbacks for me to get a job.</sentence><sentence id="870">Well, it took me about two, three weeks going every day.</sentence><sentence id="871">My brother-in-law, he would take me and paid for my carfare, for my token because I had no money.</sentence><sentence id="872">And I was going around and he helped me, he came with me at times, and they were telling me they would love to hire me, but I'm not trained for anything.</sentence><sentence id="873">And of course, you know, when I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> I didn't have money to buy clothes, so I was walking around with this big -- these big sweaters and these heavy pants.</sentence><sentence id="874">You know, I didn't really look that presentable, either.</sentence><sentence id="875">So one day I -- there was a big <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">fur place</span>, and my brother-in-law took me up there to ask for a job and I went over to the boss and I asked for a job and he looked at me, and I told him my problem and he was very sympathetic, but he says to me, I wish I would, but I don't know where to put you because you do -- y-you don't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="876">I mean you -- where -- wa -- how - - I says, I'm going to do anything you want me to do, just -- just please give me a job.</sentence><sentence id="877">He looked around and sadly said, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="878">So, I wanted to see how this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> looks like because I heard so much about it and how it works and all that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="879">So from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I sneaked into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I see that's the</sentence><sentence id="882">*s February 21, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="883">So I walk in there just to see the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and while I was passing, I saw there an old man standing and he had a beard and he wasn't working, he was just standing, looking around.</sentence><sentence id="884">And I said to mys -- you know, in my -- my grandfather came in front of me, he had a black hat like my grandfather ha-had, but he was a little shorter than my grandfather, my grandfather was very tall.</sentence><sentence id="885">So I walked over to him and I -- I felt that I can speak Yiddish to him and I did.</sentence><sentence id="886">And I told him my story.</sentence><sentence id="887">I-I says, you know, y -- I don't know if you know the tragedy on what has happened to the Jews in Europe, but I survived with my sister and I came out here, and I have a sister, but I -- I can see she cannot feed me or take care of me, I'm forced to get a job and I don't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="888">And the man listened and listened and listened.</sentence><sentence id="889">And then he says to me, wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="890">So I said to myself, why not?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="891">Ill wait.</sentence><sentence id="892">I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and no -- nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="893">I'll wait at -- and a -- I -- I -- I was watching where he was going and I saw him go to the same man that just told me that he doesn't have a job for me and I thought I was going to faint.</sentence><sentence id="894">And he was standing there and standing there with this man, and standing there and talking to him.</sentence><sentence id="895">And then he finally comes back and he says to me, come back tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="896">I says, tomorrow?</sentence><sentence id="897">What time?</sentence><sentence id="898">He said nine o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="899">When I came back, I stayed near the <span class="DLF">door</span>, eight o'clock I was already there waiting the <span class="DLF">door</span> -- for the <span class="DLF">door</span> to be opened.</sentence><sentence id="900">And finally I went in there, into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="901">Shall I continue?</sentence><sentence id="902">A -- so anyway, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, they took one look at me and as I said, I didn't look</sentence><sentence id="904">so presentable.</sentence><sentence id="905">It was a problem.</sentence><sentence id="906">And he must have promised his father, that was the son of this old man, he was the boss and IJ didn't know at that time.</sentence><sentence id="907">So this man wouldn't leave the son until he would promise him he'll give me some kind of a job.</sentence><sentence id="908">So they looked at me and they had -- it was a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they had their own designers and were so many secretaries in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="909">So the de -- I don't know, I think she was one of the designers, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="910">She takes one look at me and she says to me, you never go <span class="BUILDING">shopping</span>.</sentence><sentence id="911">I's -- wi -- I said to her, you know, there is a problem, I don't have no money.</sentence><sentence id="912">She takes another look at me, she says, well don't worry about it, we'll -- we" ll bill it to the -- to the company.</sentence><sentence id="913">So I had no choice, I go with her and this lady, I tell you, she knew exactly what to do.</sentence><sentence id="914">She knew exactly what to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="915">She -- she took me in.</sentence><sentence id="916">I remember they were smaller <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="917">Now that I know there's -- was <span class="BUILDING">Macy's</span> and everything, but she didn't want to waste time.</sentence><sentence id="918">So she took me into these smaller <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and took out different dresses.</sentence><sentence id="919">And every time she brought a dress for me to put on -- first of all, I -- you know, I didn't have a bra, I didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="920">Sh -- so she got me a little bra and stockings, she put stockings on me, I never had stockings in my life.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="921">And she -- we -- we bought a pair of shoes with a little heel, I think it was an inch and a half, or -- and she tells me I should get dressed and then she brings these dresses.</sentence><sentence id="922">I says, you know, they're so expensive, I -- you know, and I don't have any money.</sentence><sentence id="923">She says, don't worry about it, just put it on.</sentence><sentence id="924">So I put it on and I tell</sentence></p><p><sentence id="927">you, I looked like a different person.</sentence><sentence id="928">You know, I just looked like a different person.</sentence><sentence id="929">Then she went and took my -- my hair was raw, you know.</sentence><sentence id="930">She took my hair and put it in a bun, and then she put a little lipstick on me.</sentence><sentence id="931">And she bought a lot of clothes that I wasn't paying much attention because it was scaring me.</sentence><sentence id="932">And we went back and we got into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and -- and I tell you, I did look different, I must say.</sentence><sentence id="933">And so the boss came in and he took a look in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> because he was in the main <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you know, watching the workers.</sentence><sentence id="934">And I saw him looked at -- looking at me twice, like to say well, is that the same girl?</sentence><sentence id="935">So, anyway, then they gave me a job.</sentence><sentence id="936">They had a v -- like a [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, where very rich ladies came in to pick out skins for their coats.</sentence><sentence id="937">I didn't realize how rich these women were at that time.</sentence><sentence id="938">And they were training me on what to say to them and how to deal with them and in no time I was so anxious to hold this job that -- and then I-I didn't mind staying after the time, or I never went down for lunch.</sentence><sentence id="939">I would -- my sister would give me a Jell-o sandwich, I would quickly eat it right there, and I was trying my best they should keep me there.</sentence><sentence id="940">And after awhile -- after awhile they saw how -- I became a good thing for them, too.</sentence><sentence id="941">You know, they paid me, they paid me well and I became a good thing for them too, because whatever they needed, or -- they could do with me.</sentence><sentence id="942">And then had models when -- whenever a buyer would come from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, they would call a -- a model, or a few models, matter of fact, and they came in, it was a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="943">So one time I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="946">became lucky and a model didn't show up, and you know, that lady, she says, well, why don't we call in Helen?</sentence><sentence id="947">So they called Helen in and I came there and they said to me, listen, put on this coat and take a walk.</sentence><sentence id="948">You know, on a walk.</sentence><sentence id="949">I put on the coat and I took a walk, and you know, I was younger, taller, I tell you.</sentence><sentence id="950">A- Anyway, I took a walk and this buyer said to me, take another walk.</sentence><sentence id="951">I smiled at him and I took another walk.</sentence><sentence id="952">And it went well, you know, it went well.</sentence><sentence id="953">So finally that lady said to the boss, let's send her to <span class="BUILDING">modeling school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">So -- so they send me to <span class="BUILDING">modeling school</span> for a few hours, but I still had to come into <span class="BUILDING">work</span> to get my paycheck.</sentence><sentence id="955">After a few weeks, what happened was they told me the same thing, yen -- you know, put your chest out, you know, lift your head, walk graciously.</sentence><sentence id="956">You know, how many times do you need to be told what to do?</sentence><sentence id="957">So I walked over to her, I says, listen, I don't mind going there, but it seems to me like I know everything already what to do.</sentence><sentence id="958">And I did it, you know, I sort of did it -- evidently a good job because then, when a buyer would come in, they would ask, is Helen going to be there?</sentence><sentence id="959">Somebody tipped me off that a -- a buyer was asking about me, then I felt already secure with the job.</sentence><sentence id="960">Then I felt so happy.</sentence><sentence id="961">I was so happy, you have no idea.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="962">Anyway, I wound up with a beautiful job and people were very nice to me and they paid me a lot, I thought at that time, they paid me a lot.</sentence><sentence id="963">I think I was getting 75 dollar a -- a week.</sentence><sentence id="964">You see, and what happened was, they paid these models by the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="967">% February 21, 2001 hour.</sentence><sentence id="968">And here I'm willing to anything they want me to do for 75 dollars a week.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="969">But they paid me overtime if would come in on Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="970">And I ju

come soon and we're gonna go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1115">So I says -- so he says, well come, we" ll just get a Coke and we'll come right back.</sentence><sentence id="1116">So that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1117">In the meantime, I had to tell him who I was, that I'm a survivor and I just came from where -- well, then I became an object to him, that he wanted to know what happened because he -- I was the first survivor that he came -- he came in contact with.</sentence><sentence id="1118">Well, I want to tell you something, he started asking me questions and every question he gave me, it just -- I wanted to really hit him, because -- and he didn't realize what he was questioning.</sentence><sentence id="1119">And then he -- he -- so I told him, you know, you're talking to me like</sentence><sentence id="1121">it's -- like you're cross examining me.</sentence><sentence id="1122">He says, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="1123">I just want to know what happened there, do you understand?</sentence><sentence id="1124">And I wasn't ready to talk.</sentence><sentence id="1125">And the more I resisted not talking, the more he wanted to know.</sentence><sentence id="1126">So our meet -- first meeting didn't go too well.</sentence><sentence id="1127">He -- he -- and like, you know, he -- he would ask me - - he -- he really didn't mean to hurt me or anything, but he didn't know how to deal with me.</sentence><sentence id="1128">So he says to me, you know, I read in the papers that they were taking young women for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1129">I says, y-you heard right, but they were taking -- what happened was whenever they -- they took the Czech girls, they picked them up from the <span class="DLF">street</span> if they saw a Czech girl, a Polish girl, they did use them for the - - for the arm -- for the army, but the Jews were picked to be killed, not you know, taking them there.</sentence><sentence id="1130">At -- so I -- I said to myself, a lot of Jewish girls probably would feel lucky if they -- you know, just to survive -- to -- to -- to be able to do that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1131">Anyway -- but it was very, you know, it wasn't -- it wasn't good.</sentence><sentence id="1132">So then he finally says to me, listen, I want to take you <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1133">I says no, you're not taking me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, cause I'm going to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the five of these girls.</sentence><sentence id="1134">So the girls finally came.</sentence><sentence id="1135">I -- think hey kept on staying there because he wanted to pull out words from me, you see, because I wasn't ready to talk.</sentence><sentence id="1136">I couldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="1137">And finally the girls came and you know, we are finished having a good time and we says, let's go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1138">So he says to the girls, listen, I want to take you all <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1139">So the girls says yeah, take me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1140">We were five of them.</sentence><sentence id="1141">So I was between them, so -- he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1142">He had</sentence><sentence id="1144">deg February 21, 2001 a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1145">Matter of fact, he had a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Buick</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1146">So he sa -- we -- he took us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and finally he dropped them all off and my sister and I were the last one and he still wanted to talk and the guy says no, no, I have to go, you know, we're late, my sister is going to worry, we're supposed to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1147">So I -- I -- he says to me, I'll come and see you tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="1148">I says -- I heard him say it, but I didn't even answer him, I just wanted to go in, because I was annoyed with him, the way he talked.</sentence><sentence id="1149">So finally we went in and my sister says, you know, I worried -- and then my sister told us not to go into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we came in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we didn't want to lie to her.</sentence><sentence id="1150">So we -- we told her what happened and nec -- next day I was washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span> and I forgot about him, because I wasn't too nice to him.</sentence><sentence id="1151">A-And the bell rings, and -- see, we didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> was downstairs and if there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> for us, you know, somebody picked it up and rang our bell.</sentence><sentence id="1152">And my sister was busy with the kids and I was washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1153">But -- so my sister says, Helen, run down and see who's on the telephone.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1154">So I run down there barefooted, you know, because I was washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> on my hands and knees.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And I see this man standing there, I said to myself, what happened here?</sentence><sentence id="1156">Well, I did -- he did tell -- say that he's gonna come back, but I just wasn't paying any attention, my mind was so preoccupied with other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1157">So he came back and he wants to go <span class="NPIP">upstairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1158">I says look, I'm in the middle of washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I-It's very busy there, my sister is busy with the kids, I don't</sentence><sentence id="1161">think you can come upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="1162">So he says, I'll tell you what, I'1l wait in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> until you finish washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1163">So he comes up and he stays in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and my sister says, who is he?</sentence><sentence id="1164">So I says, you know, this is the guy that [indecipherable] yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="1165">I told him that he can't come because we're busy here, but he said -- he chose to stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>, so he's in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1166">So my sister was very nice, you know, she was normal, you know, she wasn't like me, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1167">So she walked out and she says, who are you, what are you?</sentence><sentence id="1168">So he was very good friends with the family of the Bestform.</sentence><sentence id="1169">The -- their name was Benenfeld.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1170">You see, he la -- he lan to the yeshiva with the Benenfeld's son-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="1171">They had one daughter and that son-in-law was a nephew of the geera rabba.</sentence><sentence id="1172">So today geera rabba don't mean anything, but in Europe it was a big situation.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And my sister knew the Benenfelds, so she says -- so she felt a little embarrassed, she says, well as soon as she finishes washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, come on in.</sentence><sentence id="1174">Because the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> wasn't that big, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> wasn't that big.</sentence><sentence id="1175">So he came in and he talked, and my sister talked to him, you know, my sister talked to him.</sentence><sentence id="1176">At that time -- at that point he wasn't no longer a stranger, but he -- sh -- he made connections with my sister, actually.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And he stood there, he says he's got to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>, he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">He told me the truth, he had a place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>, but then he -- he -- e-everything he said he told the truth, but it didn't connect with me.</sentence><sentence id="1179">So that night he left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span> and he said that he wants to come back, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1182">Q: What was his name?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1183">A: Abe Goldkind.</sentence><sentence id="1184">And so when he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>, he telephoned me a few times and then he says he is sorry that he cannot see me this week because -- but did I get the flowers?</sentence><sentence id="1185">I says yes, I got the flowers, but you know what?</sentence><sentence id="1186">I don't want you to send me any flowers.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Because they were roses and you know, after three days in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, the roses started dying.</sentence><sentence id="1188">And don't ask, I couldn't deal with that.</sentence><sentence id="1189">To me those roses represented life and all of a sudden I'm faced with death again.</sentence><sentence id="1190">So anyway, he -- he just didn't understand what I was talking about, nobody did.</sentence><sentence id="1191">And then he -- he did come to see me and -- but my sister wouldn't let me go with him because, you know, I was so young and you see, even though I was 17 - 18 years old at that time, right, I was still like a child of 12.</sentence><sentence id="1192">I had no experience with -- you know, interacting with what -- so I didn't go out with him becau -- you know, he was just come to visit me in my <span class="BUILDING">sister's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1193">And after awhile he got tired of it, he says, I want to take her to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benenfelds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1194">So my sister says, well, you're telling me you're going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benenfelds</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1195">So she says yes, so he got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and we went to the Benenfelds and I saw that, you know, he knows these Benenfelds and they were four brothers and they were, you know, very close friends, from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="1196">So yeah, came back, I says, here I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Benenfeld's house</span> and -- and after awhile he wants to take me to the movies, you know, a few weeks later when he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1197">So now my sister said no, sh -- you</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1200">deg February 21, 2001 can't take her to the movies.</sentence><sentence id="1201">So she says, okay.</sentence><sentence id="1202">So he says, fil -- you know me already, you know, you -- you must understand, I have a background.</sentence><sentence id="1203">And I wouldn't hurt her, she was hurt enough.</sentence><sentence id="1204">At that point he already understood who I am, where I come from.</sentence><sentence id="1205">So my sister says, all right, well if you take her with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>, Pll let you go.</sentence><sentence id="1206">And he had to park the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> downstairs and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>, and we went to see Al Jolson.</sentence><sentence id="1207">And that's how it started, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1208">So actually, I think what the beginning was he -- he really wanted to know what happened there.</sentence><sentence id="1209">He was a very curious person, and
