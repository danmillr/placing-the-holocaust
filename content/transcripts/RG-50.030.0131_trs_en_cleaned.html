I mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ended.</sentence><sentence id="72">This is it.</sentence><sentence id="73">Because in the meantime, we were so many people; and the sanitary things were so unsanitary.</sentence><sentence id="74">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="75">And we had three children got sick...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What kind of work did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: I worked...I was cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">In order... Anybody that didn't work, didn't get a ration of 400 gram of bread.</sentence><sentence id="117">So, of course, every...even though I was young; but I had to go to work in order to get my ration.</sentence><sentence id="118">Ration.</sentence><sentence id="119">How do you say it?</sentence><sentence id="120">Ration, ration of bread.</sentence><sentence id="121">So I went to work in the taiga--you know, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">And we were cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, you know, by hand.</sentence><sentence id="123">Cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, putting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="124">And that's how we earned our bread and water.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: How did you live?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: Well, we lived... You see, they had those wooden <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that their prisoners lived.</sentence><sentence id="138">So they took them someplace else, and they gave those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to us.</sentence><sentence id="139">And, of course, we used to cut our own wood for heating the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>--which was one <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...was one big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and like two families would live.</sentence><sentence id="140">So we would build, like against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span>; you know, from <span class="DLF">wall</span> to <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">And we slept one next to another.</sentence><sentence id="142">First of all, it kept warm; and it saved <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, because there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">And there we would go...like we would melt the snow for cooking.</sentence><sentence id="144">Cooking consisted of... 1 mean, if you got a pound of uh corn kernels, so we used to grind it and it became flour.</sentence><sentence id="145">And you boiled the water.</sentence><sentence id="146">So...in order it should be a lot.</sentence><sentence id="147">I mean, it was like 20 people; and everybody should get a spoonful.</sentence><sentence id="148">So it got thick.</sentence><sentence id="149">And you know, you would just look at; and it should get thicker and thicker, you hoped.</sentence><sentence id="150">If you didn't add water, so it got thicker.</sentence><sentence id="151">And everybody would, you know, just get a spoonful and eat.</sentence><sentence id="152">And that's what kept us going...kept us going, with the hope that some day, you know, that the war will finish and we'll go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">Hoping!</sentence><sentence id="154">But when we got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, forget it!</sentence><sentence id="155">We didn't even go even to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">We didn't go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: Let's hold <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and stay in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">We have time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: Yah.</sentence><sentence id="182">Well, <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, we worked.</sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of people...we didn't have any meat.</sentence><sentence id="184">So a lot of...when the sun went down, the light disappeared, they got blind.</sentence><sentence id="185">I mean, from lack of vitamins, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="186">If you don't eat meat, you don't have some kind of vitamin and you get blind.</sentence><sentence id="187">So as soon the sun would set, they would get like...and they would walk around like mummies.</sentence><sentence id="188">And they would say, you know, "Please take me here..." And young people.</sentence><sentence id="189">But they didn't have the meat.</sentence><sentence id="190">They didn't have all those vitamins that one needs.</sentence><sentence id="191">And my brother was like this, you know; so we had to take him.</sentence><sentence id="192">But during the day, he was all right.</sentence><sentence id="193">The minute it got a little darker, forget it!</sentence><sentence id="194">They went blind.</sentence><sentence id="195">I don't know what it was...what would you call it.</sentence><sentence id="196">But that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="197">And, of course, what, uh... You know, it was very cold there.</sentence><sentence id="198">And in the summer and the spring, like we would go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, there was a lot of... We had to wear veils over our faces, because there were big mosquitos.</sentence><sentence id="199">And if you got bitten by those mosquitos, a lot of people went crazy.</sentence><sentence id="200">Crazy, simply crazy; because I don't know what they had in them.</sentence><sentence id="201">So they gave us masks, and that's how we used to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: How were you treated by the population?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, uh we were not harassed, because... Well, first of all, we were like in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">It was only people that were taken, like myself, from...you know, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="233">And they put there.</sentence><sentence id="234">And we didn't see too many people that lived there, because all we saw is the one that .</sentence><sentence id="235">How do you say it?</sentence><sentence id="236">I forgot.</sentence><sentence id="237">My husband tells me. (</sentence><sentence id="238">Laughter).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Prisoners?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: The prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="250">Prisoners, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="251">So we would see the prisoners when they came from a different <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">And my father used to cook the water for them, you know.</sentence><sentence id="253">It was a job.</sentence><sentence id="254">The cook had water.</sentence><sentence id="255">So he used to cook the hot water, and he used to put them with a cup; and he used to give each one a cupful of water.</sentence><sentence id="256">I mean, that was the disgusting thing.</sentence><sentence id="257">Just that, water--to share water.</sentence><sentence id="258">And you would get a piece of bread, and you would soak it; and they would eat it.</sentence><sentence id="259">So these are the people actually we saw during the day.</sentence><sentence id="260">And at night, we used to be among ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="261">Family would always sit and dream and hope and pray that some day this will end, and some day we'll go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> someplace.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: What happened to him in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>?</sentence><sentence id="306">Do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Well, they kept him and they gave him some medication.</sentence><sentence id="310">And he did play along.</sentence><sentence id="311">He was very smart.</sentence><sentence id="312">He said, "Listen, if they think I am crazy.</sentence><sentence id="313">First of all, it keeps me out, you know, from the taiga, from the cutting the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">So let me be crazy."</sentence><sentence id="315">And then if...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Did you have much contact with Russian guards?</sentence><sentence id="336">How were you guarded?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Well, uh there were not too many guards.</sentence><sentence id="340">There were just only by the main <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="341">Because behind you were the taiga, were <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">You couldn't run there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">Where you gonna go?</sentence><sentence id="344">You gonna die there with the wolves.</sentence><sentence id="345">So the only thing, you had the front; and the front was the Russian guard.</sentence><sentence id="346">And that's about it.</sentence><sentence id="347">And you had no money.</sentence><sentence id="348">You couldn't go no <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">So you just had to stick to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> with everybody else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: How long were you there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: We were there for about a year and a half.</sentence><sentence id="370">And then when the war started between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and...and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, that's when they liberated us.</sentence><sentence id="371">And they told us we could go wherever we want to go; but they told all the young men--the Polish, we were Polish citizens.</sentence><sentence id="372">So they told them they could register and go with the Russian Army--as a Polish citizen with the Russian Armny--to fight against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="373">Which my two brothers did.</sentence><sentence id="374">And we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span>, which is a warm climate.</sentence><sentence id="375"><span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</span> is near <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: How did you get there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Well, we... At that time, we had some...they did... The Red Cross said...being we were Polish citizens, they did send us some sugar, tea, flour.</sentence><sentence id="386">So, of course, we didn't need it.</sentence><sentence id="387">My mother sold it.</sentence><sentence id="388">And for this, we got money to get tickets to get out of there from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">You know, just to get away.</sentence><sentence id="390">Food was... You know, food was... You know, you could get a little hungry; once you get out of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you don't want to be, you could always pick up something...did something different.</sentence><sentence id="391">So we got there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span>, and we worked very hard.</sentence><sentence id="392">Which we didn't need any clothes.</sentence><sentence id="393">We didn't need any shoes.</sentence><sentence id="394">We didn't need anything.</sentence><sentence id="395">And we waited there for the war to be over and to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="408">You didn't just...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="411">A: Well, there was also a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="412">Because a lot of people... My family, we always stuck together--my sisters and brothers.</sentence><sentence id="413">But my brothers were not with us, because they were in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="414">So it was easier, because we didn't need so much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, so many shoes.</sentence><sentence id="415">Because my brother once worked in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>; so he used to work at night.</sentence><sentence id="416">So we had only one pair of shoes.</sentence><sentence id="417">Being he is a small guy, I was always his size, even though he was older.</sentence><sentence id="418">So he used to sleep during the day; and I would work, use his shoes.</sentence><sentence id="419">Then at night, I used to sleep and he would take his shoes.</sentence><sentence id="420">So...but I used to work.</sentence><sentence id="421">We used to cut saxaul (ph) all day.</sentence><sentence id="422">Grows a certain <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branch</span> over there, it's called saxhaul (ph).</sentence><sentence id="423">And this is like corn, you know.</sentence><sentence id="424">So we used to cut it for a price, you know, for the government.</sentence><sentence id="425">And they used to give us--not pay, you know--the bread...300 bread...300 gram of bread 200...400... And that's how you survive.</sentence><sentence id="426">And then when my brother went in...like when he was in the army... So he went in like to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he would send a package to us.</sentence><sentence id="427">It was already after the war.</sentence><sentence id="428">So we should survive.</sentence><sentence id="429">So he would send shoes; so we would sell it and just wait for that moment to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">And we always sell the things in order to get the money, to always have money to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="451">Q: You could save money?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: Well, we could...just for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride; because they wouldn't give it to you.</sentence><sentence id="454">So instead to buy a pair of shoes or a coat, or even something eat good, we had to have the money to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: What were living conditions like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tashkent</span>?</sentence><sentence id="464">Where did you live?</sentence></p></dialogue>

Being as tropical...you know, tropical climate, it dries.</sentence><sentence id="473">And this was...we made bricks, and we would build a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="474">And then we would make a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>...a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="475">That's about it.</sentence><sentence id="476">And then we would make a <span class="DLF">roof</span> from the straw.</sentence><sentence id="477">And that's it.</sentence><sentence id="478">So if it got cooler, we would sleep <span class="NPIP">inside</span>; but during the summer, we would sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on mats, straw mats.</sentence><sentence id="479">Because natives even there, that's how they live.</sentence><sentence id="480">The Uzbeks, that's how they live.</sentence><sentence id="481">They sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="482">They eat on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="483">So we tried to imitate them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="501">Q: Speaking of the Uzbecks, what were your relationships like with them?</sentence><sentence id="502">The Russians?</sentence><sentence id="503">What was the relationship with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzbeks</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

Well, first of all, we did not understand them; because they did not speak Russian.</sentence><sentence id="510">We spoke Russian.</sentence><sentence id="511">They don't.</sentence><sentence id="512">And they are very family-oriented.</sentence><sentence id="513">So they were together, and they were farmers.</sentence><sentence id="514">And they grow over there melons, all kind of melons.</sentence><sentence id="515">And we lived on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">melons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">We did get a little piece of <span class="DLF">garden</span>, and we used to grow melons.</sentence><sentence id="517">And uh that's how we lived.</sentence><sentence id="518">They showed us.</sentence><sentence id="519">They were very nice to us, the Uzbeks.</sentence><sentence id="520">And they showed us how to grow, because we didn't know about it.</sentence><sentence id="521">And here again, we waited to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="522">laughter) It was one <span class="DLF">line</span>, but then they started...
