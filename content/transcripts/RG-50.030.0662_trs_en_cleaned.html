<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3365">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3367">A: It depended on if there were any complications, because we also had a special investigations unit that would look into difficult case -- cases that were, you know, harder to figure out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3369">Q: Right, right, uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3371">A: They -- you know, they might -- they might go to -- to interrogate some other people or try to get other records or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3418">Q: Uh-huh, to admit that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3420">A: For anybody to do that.</sentence><sentence id="3421">Most of them were--made excuses.</sentence><sentence id="3422">You know, they said they were forced or that they were not really a Nazi and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3423">And of course the people from -- who came from <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>, there was no way to check.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3428">Q: That's the other big problem, exactly, right.</sentence><sentence id="3429">So I was-- one of the questions I had in my mind was: Was any material used during this process, but I guess it wasn't "cause I had a different concept of it at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7038">Q: Isee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7040">A: And so each individual would get a rating that would be the conclusion and then if they were in the 4 or 5 they would be removed from <span class="BUILDING">office</span> or un, not hired and their bank account would be frozen and their property could be seized and used by the allies, by the Americans for you know like <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> could be used for troops.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7107">Q: That's the other big problem in Nazi mind.</sentence><sentence id="7108">So I was, one of the questions I had in my mind was, was there any material use during this process.</sentence><sentence id="7109">But I guess it wasn't cause I had a different concept of it at all.</sentence><sentence id="7110">You know I thought there were lectures being given on democracy or lectures</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7111">A: Oh no.</sentence><sentence id="7112">there was not attempt to change anybody.</sentence><sentence id="7113">It was completely screening.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7114">Q: And at the least suspicious back into the work force.</sentence></p></dialogue>
