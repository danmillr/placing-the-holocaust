id="754">Because the Russian army that was there, and they had their -- their -- their arms, and they were not resisting, because they saw the handwriting on the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, they

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="857">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="858">It's especially -- you know, it's strange, you know, you -- you -- when you go back to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, which looked when you were very -- when you were small, I mean, it looked to you that it's a fantastic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, because you didn't know better, you know.</sentence><sentence id="859">When you go back and you see, and -- and -- and you walk this same distance that you used to walk on the <span class="DLF">garden</span> before, it seems to you so small, and so insignificant, you know, it's a -- it's pathetic, you know?</sentence><sentence id="860">So I remember we used to walk on -- under guard, with loaded rifles like -- like supercriminals and all the -- although there were no cases -- very few cases of resistance within the -- within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, within the -- the -- the establishment.</sentence><sentence id="861">And you -- you call -- you do your work, and you come back after a day's work, whereby you have guards there, and they constantly changed.</sentence><sentence id="862">In the beginning they had the Interview with Abe Resnick *deg September 22, 1994 German guards, but then they start to bringing in the -- the [indecipherable] the Russian Ukrainians, and then brought in Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="863">And believe me, these guards, they were incompassionate.</sentence><sentence id="864">They used to beat you up every time you -- you -- you had to -- to work, I mean without -- almost without food, but constantly, and under supervision, and within the cold weather, they -- they used to put a-- a some a--a side fire in our work.</sentence><sentence id="865">From time to time you would come and -- and warm up your hands, you know, you had the mittens, or the -- but that do -- didn't mean anything now, because if your body doesn't have fuel, I mean, you -- you are -- you still cold -- it gets colder than in normal, when you have food.</sentence><sentence id="866">And they used to have special -- special <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> -- wood sticks, which they would beat you up, you know, ev-every time, and without -- without mercy.</sentence><sentence id="867">And every time you used to go to warm up, you stayed a little bit longer than what you supposed to, you know, which was prohibited to do that in the beginning, but you would do it -- come out, because when the -- and so my uncle was -- he was a sick man, you know, he -- so I used to work for him, I -- sh -- because there were a few shifts, there was like a 24 hour day, around the clock, to work at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, because they want to re-re-reestablish the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, and -- in order to be able to use that for their -- for their own -- for their own use, for their -- and life was -- was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="868">Of course, it -- it gradually was in -- in changing.</sentence><sentence id="869">In the beginning it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="870">Then after -- after a while it became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and we have received the -- before we were under the Wehrmacht, under the military.</sentence><sentence id="871">Then we -- we came under the jurisdiction of the Obersturmfiihrer Gecker(ph), and that was the SS.</sentence><sentence id="872">It's funny now this calls the -- the [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="873">So the SS, they were -- they were terrible.</sentence><sentence id="874">They -- they were still much worse than the Wehrmacht, because the Wehrmacht you found sometimes between the same guards, who were schoolteachers, who were, you know, they're -- they were -- they were called to -- to duty.</sentence><sentence id="875">But there were still certain aspects of -- of humanity, at one point, you know.</sentence><sentence id="876">But this -- this [indecipherable] came in, and then they declared that as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="877">So we came -- we became a-- a--a--- ina different status, whereby this was right after -- after the big aktia(ph), which was October 20" -- 28", 1941, is when they -- when they came in with loudspeakers and they announced that next morning, five o'clock in the morning, after we have in a -- in a special -- a special large <span class="NPIP">place</span>, that everybody has to be out.</sentence><sentence id="878">Nobody can stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">Not even the sick people can stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">Everybody has to be out.</sentence><sentence id="881">If they find somebody <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, they will shoot him.</sentence><sentence id="882">So, next morning, everybody came out, and the -- took some food, and they -- they said that you take -- if you had some food, take with you, because you're not going to be provided with any -- any food.</sentence><sentence id="883">So everybody came out, and suddenly a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> came in, and it was -- with guards, and they -- they surrounded the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and then the -- the head of the Gestapo that time was a guy by the name of Rauca.</sentence><sentence id="884">Joseph, I think was his name, Rauca, and was a big German, a heavyset guy, and they came with dogs, and they started -- they started -- first of all, they searched <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, spot searched, whatever they can find somebody.</sentence><sentence id="885">And they as-assured themselves nobody there.</sentence><sentence id="886">They start pulling people to the left and to the right.</sentence><sentence id="887">Well, right away we saw that the people that they pulled to the left are mostly children, elderly people, people who are -- have some blemish, or have some -- some -- some kind of paleness, or some kind of defect, you know.</sentence><sentence id="888">And I remember I had a little coat, you know, was a -- was a fur -- you know, the -- the collar.</sentence><sentence id="889">So -- and it was a cold --a cold [indecipherable] was October, it was already winter, basically in the -- almost snow was -- we were going to see.</sentence><sentence id="890">There were signs that snow was going to fall there.</sentence><sentence id="891">So then, I had my -- my grandmother was with me, and I knew that they are going to call her.</sentence><sentence id="892">So, it was like instinctively, you know, when they pull her away.</sentence><sentence id="893">And when the German turned around, I pulled her back, and I was able to save her, you know, right, yeah, she was still with us for a couple more years afterward.</sentence><sentence id="894">But then they -- they took out all those people, and they took them away.</sentence><sentence id="895">And that was a whole day operation, and we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="896">Of course, we understood that they are taking them to a certain special assignment.</sentence><sentence id="897">I would like also to mention that the -- the 500 intelligentsia, the people that they took out right -- right Interview with Abe Resnick &gt;&gt; September 22, 1994 after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed, we found out in the next few days, that those was the first 500 people that they took to the , and they shot them all.</sentence><sentence id="898">Because their aim and their interest was to -- to get rid of the -- of -- of more intelligent people, or people who are -- who can plan, and who were -- who had certain -- certain qualifications, you know, that they wanted to -- to get rid of them right away.</sentence><sentence id="899">And -- and then there -- there were -- they were ina certain way right, and they were, in a certain way they have accomplished their -- their -- their doing.</sentence><sentence id="900">Now this time -- that was 500.</sentence><sentence id="901">Now this time, on October 28", they took them also to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>, and they also shot them, and there were 10,000 of them.</sentence><sentence id="902">They -- they had -- they were more ready for these 10,000 than for the 500, because they already had excavated.</sentence><sentence id="903">They had -- they had a brigade that they took ahead of time, and they didn't know what -- that was a -- a small aktion, which they took about a few dozen people.</sentence><sentence id="904">And their -- their job was to excavate in the vicinity of the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="905">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fort</span> was large, you know, those forts were established by the Russians, and they were specially kept for -- for protection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="906">You see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> was surrounded by the <span class="BUILDING">Third Fort</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="907">There were like four <span class="BUILDING">forts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="908">And they were done by the -- still by the -- by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="909">They were at high -- at high levels, and -- and they were -- had a -- places for -- for -- for soldiers, and -- and -- and of course they had places for inmates.</sentence><sentence id="910">So they -- those were the 10,000 that were -- they -- they liquida -- so they actually cut by one-third, right away, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="911">This was also in conjunction with the burning, and with the -- of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="912">You see, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was instituted, they had the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and they had the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="913">What was the difference?</sentence><sentence id="914">The difference was that one main <span class="DLF">thoroughfare</span>, one main <span class="DLF">road</span>, run through the -- through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, between the small and the large.</sentence><sentence id="915">And what they did is -- what they -- what they did is they instituted a -- they built a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> from the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, which was also surrounded with wires, and that was always under military supervision.</sentence><sentence id="916">So the -- the beginning, and this -- in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="917">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that they converted, they have arranged for that, and they had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with very, very -- we had quite a number of doctors, and had quite a number of -- of -- of patients, people who were ill, who were sick, who were -- who were old, who needed -- who needed care, and there were also some women who were pregnant, you know.</sentence><sentence id="918">So this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was full to capacity.</sentence><sentence id="919">And one day what they decided is that -- that they felt that -- apparently that they don't need a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and they don't need no sick people.</sentence><sentence id="920">So what they did is they surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, they surrounded that with haystack around.</sentence><sentence id="921">They poured gas.</sentence><sentence id="922">They nailed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and they burned -- everybody was burned there, including the doctors, including the nurses, including the -- including the -- including the pregnant women, including the -- there was such a terrible -- I mean, the -- the -- you -- you could smell the -- the -- the stench, you know, the -- the people.</sentence><sentence id="923">And right after that they had the -- the big aktia(ph), and then they -- they eliminated completely -- this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was completely, those few people who still were there were evacuated, were passed to the -- to the -- to the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because it became more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> available by -- by eliminating 10,000 people, it was too much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, you know, basically, based -- based on they -- on their standard.</sentence><sentence id="924">But this was a terrible, terrible, terrible act of aggression, you know, the -- this -- this was --in human history you find these cases only in times of the Romans, you know, that's -- which also they had more compassion, you know, for certain -- for -- like for children, for -- for -- for -- for babies, and then old people and so

my cousin, who was really about, at that time, about three years, three and a half years, maybe four years.</sentence><sentence id="1788">And besides that, they want also to know where -- because they

they returned back -- back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, became devastated and found also their -- their children gone.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And the -- it was really -- the -- the feeling, I mean, was -- that was so bad, you know, that the -- the whole situation created an incredible loss of -- of hope, you know, when you saw something like this.</sentence><sentence id="1795">And this was March and it -- it was already when the Russians have advanced already, substantially towards -- towards the west -- towards -- towards -- they liberated already many, many

this.</sentence><sentence id="1797">This is -- sometimes we are talking between ourselves, some survivors, and -- and we exchange -- exchange views.</sentence><sentence id="1798">And the -- the -- the question is, between one survivor and the other one is, how to make people understand what we went through.</sentence><sentence id="1799">I mean, this is -- I mean, it's -- it's -- you see, you are

and it's hard to describe and it's hard to believe.</sentence><sentence id="1806">Sometimes I myself, it's hard for me to believe that -- that -- it looks to me like a bad nightmare, rather than that it truly happened, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1807">An-And -- and time was going so slow, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1808">The -- the -- the -- the worst part is that although you worked so hard and you did all kind of --I didn't even mention some other work that I used to do, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1809">They took us to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">army

class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span>, I know, just only to -- to have a little pastime for themselves, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1810">So I mean, it's -- it's -- it's beyond -- beyond description.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1811">So that's -- so that's one of the reasons why we meet together with survivors sometimes, and we share experiences, we -- we -- we can understand it much better than -- than -- than explaining that to the <span class="REGION">outer world</span>, you know, it's -- it -- and it's very hard to believe that a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so advanced, you know, was -- was get -- getting children and then [indecipherable] and all this.</sentence><sentence id="1812">That were -- that were able -- that wer -- came down to a <span

was -- th-this was a -- at that -- at that stage, it was already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1814">Now, next move was that we decided that we cannot keep

and I used to sit quietly and watch that and pray that she should not eat the tapioca so it would be left over for me to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1830">So she always -- so we decided to do -- how

story that he was forced into the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1838">And he -- he expressed very good sentiments.</sentence><sentence id="1839">So my uncle had to put his confidence -- he showed in -- in few cases, he showed that he was -- he was helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And we could see that he is not one of these -- one of these beasts, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1841">So my uncle explained to him and -- and he knew that we are having the child there, and -- against all odds, and he promised my uncle that he is going to help him out.</sentence><sentence id="1842">This was a remarkable -- but his comrade, his friend, whose name I forgot, was just the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="1843">Just the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="1844">What he did once was also beyond -- he encouraged people -- he opened up the -- he opened up th-this -- anyway, first, let me finish with Fiffiger(ph).</sentence><sentence id="1845">So they arranged that the -- the -- the bread was

themselves, like -- the Germans themselves, they -- they -- most of the time didn't dare to invade the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was for them, taboo.</sentence><sentence id="1893">But they used for that purpose, they used Lithuanians, in many cases, to -- to find out and to find out the right <span class="NPIP">spots</span> and then they would -- they would be able to -- to move in.</sentence><sentence id="1894">We also saw the -- not only by -- by the change of the guard and by their behavior, we -- we have felt a bigger presence in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of -- of the military.</sentence><sentence id="1895">Because normally, in all those years, they were -- they were, most of the times, guar-guarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they were hardly -- not too frequently, they -- they used to come in and -- and -- and look

the help and the -- and the cooperation of this verstattin(ph), so they used to work overtime.</sentence><sentence id="1902">I mean, instead ten or 12 hours, they used to work 14 or 15 hours, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1903">And they also implemented some shifts in that time.</sentence><sentence id="1904">The -- the underground movement grew faster and faster.</sentence><sentence id="1905">They -- they had now much better opportunities because the Lithuanians by themselves also were not dumb.</sentence><sentence id="1906">They saw that the tide is changing.</sentence><sentence

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1918">I didn't see, really a -- I mean, they were as brutal as they used to be because this -- especially the -- the -- the

some -- some more than -- than the others in -- in many, many occasions.</sentence><sentence id="1920">This [indecipherable] the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> driver, I mean, he was [indecipherable] that time when I -- I mentioned about letting -- deceiving the people and telling them they can escape and so forth and so on, because people have started feeling there, the <span class="DLF">air</span> has changed, in the sense that the front was getting closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="1921">And the question was when and how fast.</sentence><sentence id="1922">At the same time, they started getting preparations for -- for -- to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1923">Apparently this was mentioned in -- in a -- in few occasions that -- that pretty soon they have already orders in place in order to eliminate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and to -- and to take out all those remains of the -- of the people.</sentence><sentence id="1924">At that time, I think -- I'm -- I'm sure that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were not left over more than four or 5,000 people, maybe now -- maybe now from 33,000 that originally -- so what they did is also -- when -- when they -- when Interview with Abe Resnick degdeg September 22, 1994 they used to -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became smaller -- small-smaller in -- in -- in population, they also start cutting off smaller in <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1925">What they did is, where we had the Varniu(ph) gatve where the -- with the -- with the [indecipherable] was the <span class="DLF">gate</span> for the supplies, there was a -- a -- a number of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that one day they came in and they took a--a--a bunch of people, workers, and they didn't remove the <span class="DLF">fence</span> that was the original <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1926">What they did is, they put in another <span class="DLF">fence</span>, cutting off, like, four or five blocks from the -- from the original one.</sentence><sentence id="1927">So it became like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> within a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1928">This was, in a certain way, to my personal advantage, you know, because -- and maybe some others, which I -- I -- I do --I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1929">I can speak for myself on it.</sentence><sentence id="1930">What they did is, actually by -- by putting a new <span class="DLF">fence</span> and putting guards -- putting guards around this <span class="DLF">fence</span>, they have diminished the guards from the overall <span class="DLF">fence</span>, which was before, even without taking off.</sentence><sentence id="1931">So, what happened was that, when we used to go to work, we decided -- I have a-- had a --we were five -- five people that we decided to -- to flee the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1932">We saw that -- already that the time is running out.</sentence><sentence id="1933">I spoke to -- three times to one friend of mine that was in the -- was in the -- in the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1934">And he told me that whenever I want to join them I should -- I should contact somebody, and -- in order to join them.</sentence><sentence id="1935">The only thing is, after that I tried to get the -- the other -- th-the contact man and he was already gone, also.</sentence><sentence id="1936">So I went to my -- where my uncle was and I told him, look, I think that it's no -- no reason for me to remain here.</sentence><sentence id="1937">I mean, it's -- we're -- we're close.</sentence><sentence id="1938">We're very close to the end.</sentence><sentence id="1939">I mean, it's -- they are going -- one of these days, we are going to get up and we're going to find ourselves surrounded by -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they are -- they are just going to take us, and -- and -- and ta-take us out and -- and take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, or take us somewhere else, or -- or -- or take us to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1940">So my uncle, who was very conservative always -- and he really was very close to me, was -- was like -- like a father to me, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1941">And th-this was maybe one of reasons that -- that I have not left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> sooner.</sentence><sentence id="1942">And especially my grandmother, she was crazy about me, you know, she [indecipherable] that time when I saved her, you know, she -- she would not -- and we knew that she -- she -- also -- also survived, you know, the -- the children's aktion that time also when -- because she was with a

el-else.</sentence><sentence id="1944">So what -- so my uncle came to the conclusion, say that's fine and gave me his blessing, I mean, it -- and I deciding to -- now, how are we going to do it?</sentence><sentence id="1945">Sol--I devised a plan, in other word, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which were behind the first -- the general <span class="DLF">fence</span>, a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> still left.</sentence><sentence id="1946">They have -- normally, in many cases they would explode some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1947">They would put in some dynamite and explode it.</sentence><sentence id="1948">Here, they -- they have -- and -- and they did it later on with the r-- with the -- with Interview with Abe Resnick "7 September 22, 1994 the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1949">So I had a -- I had three more people with me -- three -- four.</sentence><sentence id="1950">There was one -- one guy that was himself from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and for -- some way he was stuck in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2052">100 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 west.</sentence><sentence id="2053">And we felt also that there is time for -- for me and for some friends

didn't have too much to risk because one way or the other way, I mean, we would -- we would not be able to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2055">So I went to see my uncle and I told him that -- and

put in cloth.</sentence><sentence id="2087">And she started washing right there in this -- where there was li -- this was not even like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, but it was a place

nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2090">I -- I used to collect some -- some berries, you know, from wild berries, and this was my food.</sentence><sentence id="2091">So I was desperate.</sentence><sentence id="2092">I was very hungry and this woman was washing and I said to myself, let me -- let me approach her.</sentence><sentence id="2093">And I spoke perfect Russian, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2094">So I came out.</sentence><sentence id="2095">I said, look, I'm -- I'm escapee, and like you should help me with some food.</sentence><sentence id="2096">So I was not sure whether she was going to go -- first of all, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="2097">I asked her what was there in this -- in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, where I saw the flickering lights in the night.</sentence><sentence id="2098">And she said, no, that's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">civilian ca- camp</span> for

because I looked like I'm an old, you know, the -- and I explained to her that I'm a refugee, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2104">And so she said to me, look, we have in our <span

some -- the bay -- betray them.</sentence><sentence id="2112">And then the next morning, early in the morning, we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, we approached them, and one of

are going to be close by, they have to communicate and they have to try to do certain sabotage -- sabotage work.</sentence><sentence id="2120">We spent about, I would say, maybe about close to 20 days

long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, because you see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> ha -- was in four sectors.</sentence><sentence id="2641">But <span

moved to the -- moved to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and I figured already everything out.</sentence><sentence id="2663">I figured we have a long voyage to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which is going the direction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> is in the eng -- in the British Zone of

day, what shall I do?And I had to think quickly.</sentence><sentence id="2681">I was next to the guy with the -- with his wife, and we were chatting and -- and here comes the guard, documents,

[indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2686">So why do you come [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2687">And I said a few words in German, you know, and --and my worries were

we have to go now.</sentence><sentence id="2691">We have to walk now for about two 133 Interview with Abe Resnick September 22, 1994 kilometers, because there is a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I will always go through, but there is a very little where -- sometimes even -- they don't have even a guard on the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2692">Because you see, it's not a natural <span class="DLF">border</span>, now where they -- which they had -- when they made later, in the later years, like when they -- when they had the air supply, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and th-that was much more difficult to escape now.</sentence><sentence id="2693">But in 1947, was still -- you know, it was still at a point where the war was still -- I mean, they were still not --not so organized now.</sentence><sentence id="2694">And I remember when we crossed -- I mean, there -- we heard some shots on
