And here I'd like to say that only...in...uh... in retrospect it became...the whole thing became so sad, although we thought and we did our best to save these people from going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, many of them were caught when the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="325">But a lot of them were saved.</sentence><sentence id="326">Anyway, I then decided that I was going to stay on and do a...a nice job, a quiet job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">And one of the things that I learned... call this my in-service training period.</sentence><sentence id="328">I knew nothing about American immigration laws when I came there, but because of my own knowledge of the German language and I had a staff...we had a staff of refugees who knew many languages and the...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> trusted us completely, we really became the right hand of the...of the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">Helping with interviews, with languages, with evaluations.</sentence><sentence id="330">They did the technical jobs, but we would...could do the interviewing.</sentence><sentence id="331">We could do...what they felt at least at that point...they really felt that what we could do was of great help to them.</sentence><sentence id="332">There were understaffed.</sentence><sentence id="333">And so I stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>....39, 40, 41.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="334">And...uh...I...for some... liked...I liked <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">I liked the climate.</sentence><sentence id="336">I liked the people.</sentence><sentence id="337">And I wasn't even restless at that point because we were...I thought we were doing a job.</sentence><sentence id="338">We were helping to get people to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">But one day, one morning the phone rang.</sentence><sentence id="340">And the boss at that time was Mo Levitt, Moses Levitt.</sentence><sentence id="341">And he said, "Laura, how are you doing?"

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="654">A; Yes.</sentence><sentence id="655">Anyway, it was clear we were beginning to raise money and...uh...all of 1942, and we took over the program in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q</span> and...uh...we were giving IOU's to the people.</sentence><sentence id="656">And we also set up an entirely new committee.</sentence><sentence id="657">The

weren't around anymore.</sentence><sentence id="659">And...uh...uh...so that I...we began to take on some of the old timers...uh...Polish, non---non-enemy nationals, Jewish...all Jewish who had been there for a long time and whom we could trust.</sentence><sentence id="660">And gradually while on the one hand we were working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q</span> and trying to set up the programs for the helping and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the money ad all that and raising the money, we were also beginning to train another committee, voluntary committee, to take over because it began to be clear that we were not going to be able to stay out forever because we were enemy aliens.</sentence><sentence id="661">And we got a very good committee.</sentence><sentence id="662">Very, very good committee.</sentence><sentence id="663">Many of them had been...uh...there for many years.</sentence><sentence id="664">Russians who had fled the revolution and who had made their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and who were very fine community leaders and whom we could trust.</sentence><sentence id="665">And the...the one committee that we set up, Mr. Bitker...we called it the Bitker Committee, Mr. Bitker was the Chairman, and we felt very secure in giving him power of attorney after...if anything should happen to us to ensure that part.</sentence><sentence id="666">Then, of course, in the middle of all this, we did a very...uh...unusual thing.</sentence><sentence id="667">Uh...the old <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> that were feeding the refugees when we arrived...when we took over, were very old <span class="INT_SPACE">Chinese kitchens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="668">And they had to be stoked all the time with coal and more money was going...we made an analysis that more money was going into coal than into nutrition.</sentence><sentence id="669">So what can we do?</sentence><sentence id="670">Then we heard that one day that out in the French concession of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span>, there were some new boilers that had just arrived the day before Pearl Harbor and were standing there...uh...assigned to the Sassoon Company, but were never used.</sentence><sentence id="671">So I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">Sassoon

you that permission.</sentence><sentence id="672">We're as much enemy aliens as you are."</sentence><sentence id="673">So what did we do?</sentence><sentence id="674">We had a very good friend, a Polish engineer who looked at those...uh...boilers and said, "Laura, you've got to get them."</sentence><sentence id="675">So one night when it was dark and...uh...there were millions of people buzzing around on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> all the time and the...and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaws</span> were going back and forth and nobody was paying any attention to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="676">We hired a group of coolies and this engineer, Manny and I went out to the <span class="DLF">French concession</span> and we highjacked the two big (laughing)

id="677">Nobody was paying any attention to us.</sentence><sentence id="678">Taking them over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, and we got them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Q.</span> And from that point on, we built a new <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> which was really giving nutrition and we burned up the old <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">That's one of our fun stories.</sentence><sentence id="680">Anyway, it got to be around the end of...uh...October, November 42, the rumors came and one day we were notified by radio...there were no television in those years...that the Japanese authorities are asking all enemy aliens to prepare themselves for internment.</sentence><sentence id="681">You would be allowed to take in anything you like to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="682">They didn't tell us which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that point.</sentence><sentence

us.</sentence><sentence id="685">And then Manny got notified (pause) I think it was January 43 already that he was going to an all-men's camp over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paoting</span>.</sentence><sentence id="686">I had not received a notice yet.</sentence><sentence id="687">So we packed him off, and a month later I got notice.</sentence><sentence id="688">And...uh...I actually took my own folding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> and...and...uh....a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> full of canned goods and stuff and things and...and then...the...the Japanese were a peculiar race.</sentence><sentence id="689">It's a...an interesting group of people.</sentence><sentence id="690">Uh...

id="691">Right now the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> escapes me, but it isn't important.</sentence><sentence id="692">It was the beginning of 43, I think February or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="693">We got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which, of course, was surrounded by <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">It was a old <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> that had been bombed during the Japanese-Chinese wars and it was leaking here and there and everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="695">And...uh...I got into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with 40 women, and...uh...first thing I did, when I saw the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was to see at the very end there were <span class="DLF">windows</span> going...getting out to the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">It was an old <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="697">It had a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">campus</span>, and I quickly took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and dumped it in that <span class="REGION">area</span> so that I would...all the 40 women would be in back of me and I would see the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="698">That was the first thing I thought of.</sentence><sentence id="699">Anyway, it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="700">That night we turned on...they gave us fuel and they gave us an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span>, and all of them lit...all of them were smoking, and so that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="701">We never burned them again.</sentence><sentence id="702">We just put on more clothes.</sentence><sentence id="703">Now, the Japanese were very good to us I think.</sentence><sentence id="704">Now some of the...some of the high and mighty people who had been the old Shanghailanders that we called it, were very resentful of having to be in those conditions and under the Japanese.</sentence><sentence id="705">But that's something I've never had.</sentence><sentence id="706">I've never had any kind of feeling about race, color, anything.</sentence><sentence id="707">I think they were absolutely correct in terms of the Geneva convention.</sentence><sentence id="708">They gave us everything that was due to us.</sentence><sentence id="709">They brought in the food.</sentence><sentence id="710">We had to cook it ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="711">And they said to us, "Listen, get organized.</sentence><sentence id="712">Put up your committees.</sentence><sentence id="713">Do what you like.</sentence><sentence id="714">We'll bring in the food.</sentence><sentence id="715">And organize your own social activities.</sentence><sentence id="716">Do anything you like, but do it yourselves, knowing that we are here and that we are supervising."</sentence><sentence id="717">And so the first thing that got...one of the things that go around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was that I was there.</sentence><sentence id="718">And someone came to me and said, "We want you to chair our committee because you've had experience."</sentence><sentence id="719">I said, "I am Laura Margolis with no experience.</sentence><sentence id="720">I am a number.</sentence><sentence id="721">I have a number.</sentence><sentence id="722">I don't want to be...I don't want to be known.</sentence><sentence id="723">I don't want to have anything to do with all this.</sentence><sentence id="724">But you had to choose two...uh...everybody had to take on two jobs.</sentence><sentence id="725">So I made a very quick ____ as we say.</sentence><sentence id="726">I...uh...realized that when you're near the food, it's important so I took kitchen duty.</sentence><sentence id="727">And...uh...the other <span class="NPIP">thing</span> was...oh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>...there was <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">And out there were <span class="DLF">fields</span>, and we were supposed to grow are own vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="729">And I've always liked farming anyway so...uh...and just being out of it is...is very important for me.</sentence><sentence id="730">So I chose the second chore and that was to go out and work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="731">And that worked very well.</sentence><sentence id="732">But then came 4, 5, 6 months of that and people were getting sick.</sentence><sentence id="733">And that's natural in all of <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">I mean they were carrying them out by the dozens to the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, diarrhea and all that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="735">And...uh...nothing was happening to me.</sentence><sentence id="736">I was as healthy as a horse.</sentence><sentence id="737">But I decided I had to get out because I just could stand the collective.</sentence><sentence id="738">So I knew I wasn't going to commit suicide but I had sleeping pills and I wasn't going to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="739">But what I did was to eat less, grow weaker and...uh...put on my Sarah Burnhart act.</sentence><sentence id="740">And so I was sent to the doctor...to the doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who was an 2 American doctor.</sentence><sentence id="741">And he gave me a permit to get out to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because he said I was very sick, which I wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="742">And I got out to the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">It was a <span class="BUILDING">English hospital</span> and Dr. Veal who an Italian was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he remembered me from...from contacts we had before Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="744">And they put me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span>, and when he came to make his rounds in the evening and he saw me there, he caught on immediately because no matter what he did, I was in good shape.</sentence><sentence id="745">But he said I was very sick and so he said, "Now, there are two things.</sentence><sentence id="746">You shouldn't be in a <span class="BUILDING">ward</span>.</sentence><sentence id="747">I can get you a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span>, but if you want a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span> you'll have to...I have to notify...I have to write to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> for permission.</sentence><sentence id="748">But I can give you a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with another lady on my own responsibility."</sentence><sentence id="749">I said, "I'd rather take the lady...the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the lady."</sentence><sentence id="750">And what happened there was that she was really a lovely, lovely Russian girl who was a mistress of the director of the <span class="BUILDING">German bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and he used to come to visit her every day.</sentence><sentence id="751">And I had no right for visitors.</sentence><sentence id="752">And one day he said to me...he said, "You know," he said, "You are not allowed visitors.</sentence><sentence id="753">Wouldn't you like to tell your friends <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that they can use my friend's name and come up and see you?"</sentence><sentence id="754">And that's the way I saw Mr. Bitker.</sentence><sentence id="755">I saw my friends.</sentence><sentence id="756">I got...I got the message out.</sentence><sentence id="757">And...uh...I was there for 3 months.</sentence><sentence id="758">They kept me out in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then came August...July, August 43.</sentence><sentence id="759">Right?</sentence><sentence id="760">And...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> surrendered in the war...gave up as being one of the Axis and the next morning when that happened Dr. Veal came right in to see me and he said, "Laura, now I'm an enemy alien and I don't know what's going to be with me next, but before coming here I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Consulate</span> because the Swiss had the authority over all enemy aliens."</sentence><sentence id="761">And he said, "You're on the list for the next prisoner of war exchange.</sentence><sentence id="762">So I'm going to release you now.</sentence><sentence id="763">You go back, start packing and in September you will...uh...be re...on that...on that exchange.</sentence><sentence id="764">Your name is on it."</sentence><sentence id="765">He said I also found out that your name was on the first exchange which was a diplomatic exchange, but the Japanese took you off because they needed you. (</sentence><sentence id="766">Laughing) So I went back.</sentence><sentence id="767">Before I went back, I sw Bitker once.</sentence><sentence id="768">For the last time!</sentence><sentence id="769">And I got a...because he had power of attorney to raise money and in...in the name of the JDC to repay.</sentence><sentence id="770">And...uh...nobody knew when the war would end you know.</sentence><sentence id="771">So I said, "Look, I'm going to be out of this pretty soon.</sentence><sentence id="772">Just give me a...uh...up to date account of what the situation is financially so I can get it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="773">Well, he gave me the whole accounting up-to-date.</sentence><sentence id="774">When we were prepared in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>...that was September 43, that we were to pack and we were going to go ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="775">This was the beginning of our repatriation exchange of prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="776">I had always these figures, and I took toilet paper because I knew that there would be a body of search...body search before they...before we were left to go.</sentence><sentence id="777">And...uh...I took the...uh...the toilet paper.</sentence><sentence id="778">I wrote every piece of...all the figures down, rolled it up and put it in the rubber pants...the... uh...top of my panties, so that...uh...it was invisible and... uh...started packing.</sentence><sentence id="779">And in September 43, I forget the date exactly, we were...those of us who were on the list from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were taken on a...to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ship</span> as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goa</span> where the exchange would take place.</sentence><sentence id="780">That was in...it was <span class="REGION">Portugese Goa</span> which was part of the <span class="REGION">Indian mainland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="781">And...uh...we got on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="782">It was...uh...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ship</span> which had a passenger capacity for about 100, and we were hundred and...one thousand five hundred, because we picked up people on the way.</sentence><sentence id="783">And what they gave us women were...uh...like stalls hat you put horses on and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="784">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> were full of fleas.</sentence><sentence id="785">So the first...the first night we took all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> (laughing) 3</sentence></p></dialogue>

way...this is the way I remember it...uh...authorization, because we always had a delegate in...uh...during 4 all the wars.</sentence><sentence id="964">We always had a delegate in <span
