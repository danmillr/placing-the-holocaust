class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was, was within sight.</sentence><sentence id="3">We could see maybe one mile away.</sentence><sentence id="4">We women start say, "How can we run?</sentence><sentence id="5">We cannot even walk."</sentence><sentence id="6">Somebody else said, "The guards may be hiding behind the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">They just wait for us to start running and they'll have an excuse to shoot us."</sentence><sentence id="8">So all day long we sat in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, not knowing that the guards had run away.</sentence><sentence id="9">They escaped.</sentence><sentence id="10">You see we did not know whether the war was ending, where the positions of the armies were.</sentence><sentence id="11">We didn't even know that there were Allied forces.</sentence><sentence id="12">We didn't know a thing.</sentence><sentence id="13">In the evening, it was dark already, | remember it well, we heard footsteps of boots.</sentence><sentence id="14">Now up to this day when | hear boots marching, even on the beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parade</span>, | get nervous because footsteps of boots reminded us of SS and Gestapo and selections so there we heard these footsteps and we said, "Oh, the henchmen are back."</sentence><sentence id="15">But we heard Russian language.</sentence><sentence id="16">Russian language, Russian soldiers, dear ladies, we didn't know you were here, we were, we are fighting the war, we found already a few other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">We cannot stay with you.</sentence><sentence id="18">We leave two, three people.</sentence><sentence id="19">Tomorrow there medics will come and help you.</sentence><sentence id="20">So all through the night we still stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, naturally we were free.</sentence><sentence id="21">Now what happened in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> the night of liberation?</sentence><sentence id="22">Some people applauded with their hands.</sentence><sentence id="23">They could hardly move them.</sentence><sentence id="24">Some people jumped up for joy.</sentence><sentence id="25">Some people started to talk where they will go, what will they do.</sentence><sentence id="26">| personally cried.</sentence><sentence id="27">| cried so hard and it is now 50</sentence><sentence id="29">Nesse Godin 4 December 14, 1995 Page 4 years after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="30">And for 50 years, I'm trying to analyze, why did | cry?</sentence><sentence id="31">Did | cry for my family that was dead?</sentence><sentence id="32">At that point, | didn't know if anyone was alive because in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> | was alone.</sentence><sentence id="33">No one of my family.</sentence><sentence id="34">Did | cry for, because | didn't know what was happening?</sentence><sentence id="35">Did | cry for joy?</sentence><sentence id="36">But | came to a conclusion that | cried because | felt sorry for myself.</sentence><sentence id="37">| thought where am | going?</sentence><sentence id="38">There's no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> to pick up and tell I'm coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">There's no <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, no family and sincerely, many kind people say, "Nesse, you talk about the Holocaust and we don't see tears from you."</sentence><sentence id="40">| really cried that time the last time.</sentence><sentence id="41">So once in a while, | have a little tear in my eye.</sentence><sentence id="42">| learned to laugh and to love.</sentence><sentence id="43">But | never cry.</sentence><sentence id="44">So that was this night, the day of liberation.</sentence><sentence id="45">The following day, when the Russians came, they explained to us that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> does not have a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">They have a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">They are going to convert this little, it's a <span class="BUILDING">inn</span>, not even a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">They are going to convert it into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">They are going to try to take the little healthier women and bring them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, put "em in the little <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">Some <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were already empty.</sentence><sentence id="51">The Germans had run away being afraid for the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="52">Some, in some <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there were still some Germans that stayed.</sentence><sentence id="53">| know they spoke German, it was a <span class="REGION">German area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54"><span class="COUNTRY">Pomerania</span>, mostly, Polish German, <span class="DLF">border</span> but this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was mostly German.</sentence><sentence id="55">They, so the Russians the next day came with little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span>, whatever they could take from the villagers, a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">Nesse Godin 5 December 14, 1995 Page 5 personally was carried by a Russian soldier, on his arms, and he carried me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">| was nothing but skin and bones.</sentence><sentence id="60">And he brought me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, he put me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, on a straw sack and he said that eventually somebody will come and help me and give me food.</sentence><sentence id="61">A little bit later, they brought another woman that they put next to me on the straw sack.</sentence><sentence id="62">This woman, I'm really sorry that | cannot remember her name.</sentence><sentence id="63">She was a teacher in one of the religious Yovna (ph) schools and | knew her from before the war because | had friends that went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">And when | saw her | was so glad that she was there next to me on that straw sack.</sentence><sentence id="65">At least | felt | had someone from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">And the Russian soldiers every day came for a few days, they delivered a little bit food for us.</sentence><sentence id="67">Also, some Jewish women that were a little bit stronger started to cook a little bit, get from the villagers some food or just take it from them and started to cook a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="68">After | was there one day or two days, | really don't remember, one day, one of the women that were a little stronger walked in and just said to me, "What are you doing here with a dead person?"</sentence><sentence id="69">| didn't realize that the woman next to me was dead.</sentence><sentence id="70">They carried her out and | wanted to really go out and go out like, see where they're burying her or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="71">But | couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="72">So | thought let me look out and see how the free world looks.</sentence><sentence id="73">Cause | hadn't seen the free world.</sentence><sentence id="74">Could hardly get up.</sentence><sentence id="75">And there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">windowpane</span>, it was already towards evening.</sentence><sentence id="76">And | looked through</sentence><sentence id="78">Nesse Godin 6 December 14, 1995 Page 6 that <span class="DLF">windowpane</span> to see how is freedom?</sentence><sentence id="79">What's <span class="NPIP">outside</span>?</sentence><sentence id="80">And what | saw was a monster.</sentence><sentence id="81">A reflection of a monster in that <span class="DLF">windowpane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">A person, eyes sunken in, really a skeleton covered with skin.</sentence><sentence id="83">That's what | saw.</sentence><sentence id="84">Like you see children for Halloween how they have these masks and | turned around to see who was behind me and there was no one there.</sentence><sentence id="85">And this is when | realized how | looked.</sentence><sentence id="86">How | looked.</sentence><sentence id="87">| did not really imagine that | looked that way.</sentence><sentence id="88">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="89">After a few days being in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, one, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, | believe it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that came and picked us up and took us to that <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">What | remember of that coming to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, | remember them shaving my head, shaving my private parts wherever hair is, washing me with some kind of a disinfectant because | remember a burn of a, where they shaved.</sentence><sentence id="91">And then | didn't remember anything else.</sentence><sentence id="92">Not a thing.</sentence><sentence id="93">Next thing | remember, opening my eyes and seeing a man with a white coat on and talking to me in Russian, explaining to me that he is a doctor, that | shouldn't worry, I'm in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he would love to know my name.</sentence><sentence id="94">Because they did not have time to register me when | became unconscious.</sentence><sentence id="95">According to what they told me | was three days unconscious with high fever of typhus and typhoid, those two different diseases.</sentence><sentence id="96">And him telling me that the most thing that he's worried about is that my toes were frozen and he just hopes that they wouldn't have to be amputated.</sentence><sentence id="97">And as | started to tell him my age, people from down the row, it was</sentence><sentence id="99">Nesse Godin 7 December 14, 1995 Page 7 like a big <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> with many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, somebody else tells "Oh, Nesa that's you!</sentence><sentence id="100">We didn't know who this was.</sentence><sentence id="101">Everybody asked do you know this person?"</sentence><sentence id="102">And there were a few people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> that | knew and | really felt already more comfortable about it.</sentence><sentence id="103">So | was gettin" a little better.</sentence><sentence id="104">People started to leave from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then | was transferred to another smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">The main thing, the treatment was on my legs.</sentence><sentence id="106">And | don't even remember if | ever said that, if | gave this testimony or not but | really feel | should tell it now.</sentence><sentence id="107">| decided that | don't want to live.</sentence><sentence id="108">After all this that | went through, the stupidity of me, not wanting to live was, now when | think back of it, it was crazy.</sentence><sentence id="109">| heard and saw some people were united with the, right there in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there was a mother and a daughter and here | was all by myself.</sentence><sentence id="110">| thought what do you need to live for?</sentence><sentence id="111">So | decided to do a hunger strike and every time they brought a little food, | just threw it out or gave it to the lady next to me.</sentence><sentence id="112">And she was, | thought of that, I'm terrible but now | think of her as wonderful, she told on me.</sentence><sentence id="113">So they wouldn't walk out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> until | finished the food.</sentence><sentence id="114">And | really recovered pretty good.</sentence><sentence id="115">My, what was at that point, | still had, you see at the very end on the death march | was beaten up severely.</sentence><sentence id="116">And | still had my face swollen.</sentence><sentence id="117">My toes had kind of, the, the, a big layer that was frozen of the skin just peeled off, like, like you see a snake change his skin?</sentence><sentence id="118">That's how this came off.</sentence><sentence id="119">And my temperature</sentence><sentence id="121">Nesse Godin 8 December 14, 1995 Page 8 went down and | gained a little bit weight so, they kept me there because | was alone for a while.</sentence><sentence id="122">And then one day they told me | have to go down to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">The <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> was like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">And when | came down there, they said to me, "We are going to close this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and you can go now.</sentence><sentence id="125">We feel you're in good shape.</sentence><sentence id="126">You can go."</sentence><sentence id="127">And | said to them, "Where should | go?"</sentence><sentence id="128">They said, "Well, you want to go up, where are you from?"</sentence><sentence id="129">| said, "I'm from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> but | don't have a home.| don't have a family, | don't have anybody.</sentence><sentence id="130">| don't know where | should go.</sentence><sentence id="131">I'm 17 years old.</sentence><sentence id="132">| don't know what to do."</sentence><sentence id="133">So they asked the lady that was next to me where she was from and she happened to be from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and because | was just 17, | was a minor.</sentence><sentence id="134">| was assigned to her.</sentence><sentence id="135">| became her ward.</sentence><sentence id="136">We had one document that stated her name and my name, my last name and saying that she's in charge because I'm a minor.</sentence><sentence id="137">And that's how we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freenuv</span> (ph).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Do you have her name?</sentence><sentence id="286">Do you remember her name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: | don't, | remember her first name, Hannah, but | don't think | ever knew her last name.</sentence><sentence id="290">| don't think | ever knew it.</sentence><sentence id="291">She was very kind.</sentence><sentence id="292">She was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="293">She was more like a sister to me than a stranger.</sentence><sentence id="294">So we left, with the idea to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">She had left a child for safe, safekeeping with a Lithuanian family.</sentence><sentence id="296">She was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.901111" long="23.979444">Kaunas</span> and she really thought that maybe her child is alive.</sentence><sentence id="297">She wants to go back.</sentence><sentence id="298">Now | wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> because the last thing that we said to each other</sentence><sentence id="300">Nesse Godin 9 December 14, 1995 Page 9 when we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, that is my brother and my mom before we were separated, if we survive this <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, we have to make a meeting point, back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">So okay.</sentence><sentence id="302">So this | had back in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="303">And | thought after all, we had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we had a business, we left belongings with non-Jewish people for safekeeping.</sentence><sentence id="304">Maybe I'll find it.</sentence><sentence id="305">So that was my plan.</sentence><sentence id="306">So there we go.</sentence><sentence id="307">You couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, say | want to buy a ticket to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">Didn't work that way.</sentence><sentence id="309">See you are very young, | don't know if you understand that.</sentence><sentence id="310">That first it, it wasn't even, the war hadn't even ended yet, so a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military trucks</span> were going east and they were going west and they were going south.</sentence><sentence id="311"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trains</span> were going back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="312">The Russians were looting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and taking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machinery</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">So you hitchhiked.</sentence><sentence id="314">You hitchhiked on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">You stood there, you told them you want to go little bit east, they took you.</sentence><sentence id="316">They said, "You want to go up to this and this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we'll take you."</sentence><sentence id="317">Then you have to wait for a next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it took weeks until you got at least somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="318">And this is the way we arrived in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, like through the <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> while we were traveling people were telling us that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, there is already <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">Christian relief, <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>, Jewish relief, Hiyas (ph), the Join (ph), some kind of Jewish agencies helping out refugees.</sentence><sentence id="321">All of a sudden we were called refugees.</sentence><sentence id="322">So, we were very glad to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="323">When we came</sentence><sentence id="325">Nesse Godin 10 December 14, 1995 Page 10 there, there was a big shelter on 66.</sentence><sentence id="326">| remember that address and we, when we came in there was a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, we signed in, we were assigned where to go to sleep and in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, there were big billboards.</sentence><sentence id="327">Posters like, and it was divided by <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and divided each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> more or less by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">And you, if let's say if you were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.901111" long="23.979444">Kaunas</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.901111" long="23.979444">Kaunas</span> and surrounding and surround <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span>, that's in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was called and surrounding.</sentence><sentence id="329">So | saw quite a few names there and | wrote down my name.</sentence><sentence id="330">That was in case somebody of your family comes.</sentence><sentence id="331">That's how you got connected.</sentence><sentence id="332">You see when | tell it to people, they cannot understand why would you want to write your name on a posterboard but this was the way you found each other.</sentence><sentence id="333">Your name and where you are staying, whether you are continuing, whether you are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, wherever.</sentence><sentence id="334">And that particular, that <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> was, there was a big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> with many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on, see in Europe, some people don't understand that especially in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, they used to have a whole <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> maybe six, seven <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">And you had to go in through a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and it was closed for the night.</sentence><sentence id="336">And so we were assigned in that same <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="337">Now all that night | thought to myself, why didn't | write down my name within eyesight.</sentence><sentence id="338">| wrote it down kind of low in the poster, nobody's going to bend down and look for my name.</sentence><sentence id="339">| was 17, | wasn't too bright.</sentence><sentence id="340">And | could hardly wait for the next day to go back and put my name with eye level on that thing.</sentence><sentence id="341">| said, "I'll put it</sentence><sentence id="343">Nesse Godin 11 December 14, 1995 Page 11 on again, that's

Polish citizen you were allowed to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="681">And most people did not want to stay in the Soviet Union cause it was Communism and most Jewish people had the dream at that time to, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="682">So he told us that he knows that in a very short time, he doesn't know it'll take a week or two weeks or three weeks that his cousin and, and, he's, my aunt who's, he's cousin to by marriage are going to try to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">We shouldn't go nowhere, we'll be reunited.</sentence><sentence id="684">So we were anticipating every day are they coming, are they coming?</sentence><sentence id="685">My mother went always to check if their name is on the board and finally they arrive.</sentence><sentence id="686">They arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, my uncle, my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="687">They had a boy that was twelve years old.</sentence><sentence id="688">My uncle's best friend, he's my, his best

unit.</sentence><sentence id="690">Here we are surrounded with my aunt and my uncle and, and a few guys that are there and we are all looking, where should we</sentence><sentence id="692">Nesse Godin 19 December 14, 1995 Page 19 go?</sentence><sentence id="693">Where should we go.</sentence><sentence id="694">We get already messages that the men were liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">We hear already that the men that were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtoodruff</span> (ph) that came with us from

they decided to send out a few people to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, see if, and tell the women don't go back to the Soviet Union, don't go to Communism.</sentence><sentence id="699">Try to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American Zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="700">So and so they came with list telling who survived.</sentence><sentence id="701">On that

looked at my mother and | thought she has me.</sentence><sentence id="712">Why</sentence><sentence id="714">Nesse Godin 20 December 14, 1995 Page 20 does she want to get married?</sentence><sentence id="715">But the next thing out of my mother's mouth was, "My child, | had a wonderful husband.</sentence><sentence id="716">He was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="717">But you, it's true you're very young.</sentence><sentence id="718">Maybe you should get married."</sentence><sentence id="719">So | looked at her, | said, "Where do | get a husband?"</sentence><sentence id="720">And she said, "Look at those guys, three guys, single guys.</sentence><sentence id="721">The friend of the uncle's, his brother and his friend."</sentence><sentence id="722">Well | looked at the three guys and | said, "Well this one is too old.</sentence><sentence id="723">This one is too short and maybe this one."</sentence><sentence id="724">So my mother said, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="725">Now | don't know how Jack and | got married, | really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="726">We, we just talked that it would be a good idea and | never kissed him before or anything and we went and we did a document that I'm his wife.</sentence><sentence id="727">And so, we were already like a, a threesome, a family.</sentence><sentence id="728">But | really didn't, legally, | was his wife but for all practical services we were not husband and wife until later on we had the religious

id="731">There is a, the Jewish agent, he's helping out people to go across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="732">Once you get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"
