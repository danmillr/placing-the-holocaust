<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="132">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="133">Well, our faith was a central thing in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="134">Both my mother and father had grown up in the <span class="BUILDING">religious homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">We are what is known na -- here, as Sephardic, which, for those who don't know, means that we are descendant of the Jews who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, and after the expulsion, they went to either <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>, or they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> and crossed over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, or they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and moved with the Turkish occupation.</sentence><sentence id="136">They moved further up and of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.867" long="18.417">Sarajevo</span> was Turkish outpost and that's where they -- they must have come that route, I think.</sentence><sentence id="137">Although <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was settled by Jews of Italian descent, which means that the most people who live i -- most Jews who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>, came from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span>, through <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and crossed over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic</span>, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">As I said, our -- our religion played a central role in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="139">We observed all of the holidays, quite religiously.</sentence><sentence id="140">We never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on any of the Jewish holidays.</sentence><sentence id="141">We maintained a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, and we -- the education was such in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, that the</sentence><sentence id="143">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 6 primary subject in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was religion.</sentence><sentence id="144">So, because we were a very small minority, when the priest would come to teach religion, we would be excused, we would have a free period.</sentence><sentence id="145">And there is a payback, later we would have to go twice a week to the -- some <span class="BUILDING">facility</span>, usually was one <span class="BUILDING">central school</span>, well all -- where all the Jewish kids would come and we would have Jewish education, which consisted of course, of religious observances, Hebrew, history and well, songs and such.</sentence><sentence id="146">That's about what I remember, as a young child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Can you remember anything -- and perhaps share it with us, that your parents taught you, not just about religion, but the -- the place of Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="164">Where did they fit into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="165">Do you remember them talking about that, or what was your perception of where they fit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Well, I think the Jews were in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>, they were pretty well integrated with the general community.</sentence><sentence id="170">Most of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> were either small merchant -- and I'm emphasizing small, or they were professional people, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and such.</sentence><sentence id="171">So, I don't think that there was too much distinction, as I was growing up.</sentence><sentence id="172">The -- We had, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, we were totally integrated and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">business community</span>, you sa -- s -- have, let's say, <span class="BUILDING">shoe stores</span>, there would be several of them, one might be owned by a Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="173">The rest would be owned by the local, whatever religion.</sentence><sentence id="174">Prevailing religion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>, was of course, Roman Catholicism, and -- but they also had a few, I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox, or Eastern Orthodox, but prevailing Serbs.</sentence><sentence id="175">So, we were -- as kids we were lumped with s-some of the Eastern</sentence><sentence id="177">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 7 Orthodox in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because we were the ones -- we and them, were the ones who were told we can be excused during the religious instructions in the class.</sentence><sentence id="178">But the classes were conducted still -- there was a big crucifix on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and everybody had to say the Catholic prayers, which we would just stand up and not say them.</sentence><sentence id="179">But this was true fo -- both of us, and the Serbian Orthodox kids.</sentence><sentence id="180">And some -- some classes, there were a few of those and few Jews.</sentence><sentence id="181">Sometimes I would be the only one of my faith or only one who was not a Roman Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="182">So I -- I didn't feel too much of a -- a burden, and especially when it was time to be excused.</sentence><sentence id="183">I accepted that gladly.</sentence><sentence id="184">Yeah?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: What was the reaction when you stood and you did not say the Catholic prayers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Well, I think that -- I had a teacher who liked me.</sentence><sentence id="204">I was the best student in <span class="BUILDING">class</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">That was my -- I don't know whether that was a burden I carried, but I enjoyed studies.</sentence><sentence id="206">So -- And I was a very, very small kid for my age.</sentence><sentence id="207">Everybody towered over me.</sentence><sentence id="208">So everybody considered me like a -- I don't know, like a little puppy and the teacher did, too.</sentence><sentence id="209">I remember now, that I'm being asked to recall some of these things, I remember I would be cuddled by every teacher over there.</sentence><sentence id="210">We didn't have any male teachers, just female teachers, and they were all single, not -- none of them usually were married.</sentence><sentence id="211">Anyway, so, nobody ever said anything.</sentence><sentence id="212">I -- I know, in fact, later on, at one point, I learned from somebody that there was a possibility of having an interfaith prayer.</sentence><sentence id="213">So I suggested that, and she accepted it for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="214">I guess she was reprimanded later on.</sentence><sentence id="215">But this came -- There was at -- somebody who had left <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and this one young girl said that they had that ecumenical prayers.</sentence><sentence id="216">So she gave me the translation of</sentence><sentence id="218">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 8 the Romanian ecumenical prayer, which I -- which is the one that I brought to my teacher, and that's the one that was tried, for awhile, anyway.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: So a-at this point, you're quite comfortable and assertive about who you are?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Today, you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: No, at this point, i-in your life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Oh, you -- you mean like [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: You're -- You're a young boy, but you're very clear about saying that you were quite comfortable with the mix of people and also saying that I am Jewish and I would like my faith included here, if possible.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Yeah, well, that was true for a long while.</sentence><sentence id="244">However, the situation started changing with the political situation.</sentence><sentence id="245">And I would say the first changes were when Hitler took over <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and there was pressure on every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> nearby, to sign up with the axis powers.</sentence><sentence id="246">So, there was again, like I mentioned to you earlier, I was told once not to talk about politics, but this is not politics, this is -- this relates to the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="247">There was a party in the -- in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, the <span class="REGION">Croatian area</span>, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ustashi</span> and they were beginning to rise up, with assistance from the Austrian government and later from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="248">And they were agitating, and of course, they took the same -- Hitler's, you know, values, and preachings and that's -- at that point, started getting somewhat -- more and more uncomfortable for us.</sentence><sentence id="249">In fact, occasionally, we w -- we would be attacked by the local kids and I'm not talking about stealing our lunch, or anything like that, although that took</sentence><sentence id="251"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0038 9 place on occasions, but just for the sake of playing the role that they heard from their parents, who were sympathizers of the Fascist governments.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: C-Can you do -- remember one of those incidents, just so we could get a clearer picture of it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: Oh yeah, very much so.</sentence><sentence id="265">The -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was located on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and there were areas, the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and Saturday morning I was always at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Saturday and others -- friends of mine my age, and I, we -- we were pretty close, so Saturday after the services, we would go for a walk, and there was areas in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that were well known for people walking.</sentence><sentence id="266">But we would go further, we would go to the <span class="REGION">areas</span> that are <span class="REGION">beach fronts</span> and in the winter months this was sort of nice, because it wasn't crowded -- it wasn't too crowded.</sentence><sentence id="267">There were people there, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was in a -- I won't call it temperate zone, but it was very comfortable, especially if you could be shielded from the wind, and our <span class="DLF">beaches</span> were shielded.</sentence><sentence id="268">So, we would go walk, maybe even take our shoes off and walk in the -- on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">surf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">And sometimes, or one time, wasn't just one time, but often, some of these other kids from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> would start throwing the rocks at us, and stones.</sentence><sentence id="270">And, you know, I learned to fling rock pretty well, also, but they were usually in the majority, so we always ended up at the short end of the stick.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: H-How did you know that -- How did you interpret this, or how did you know or feel that it was because you were a -- a Jewish boy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="283"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0038 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Well, there was no doubt, because they accompanied their attacks with vocal attacks, too.</sentence><sentence id="285">So there was no doubt why they were doing it.</sentence><sentence id="286">They -- They made it quite clear, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about how things started to shift?</sentence><sentence id="288">I guess when you were fairly young, things were pretty good and calm and -- and you felt comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="289">But then, as you said, Hitler came on the scene and things started to shift.</sentence><sentence id="290">If you could just tell us a little bit more how that started to alter life in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="291">Things that your parents said to you perhaps, or you overheard?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Okay, well, first of all, when Hitler started coming on the scene, maybe 1935 or "36, I was only six or seven years old.</sentence><sentence id="293">But in those <span class="REGION">areas</span>, we -- the kids, six, seven, we were pretty aware of what was going on, because we had to be and we heard our parents listen to the radi -- I mean, we heard them talk, listen to the radio intensively.</sentence><sentence id="294">You know, everybody had to keep quiet while they were listening to the news and what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="295">And so we were quite aware.</sentence><sentence id="296">And at first -- well, the first signs, we knew that there was an effort being made to teach the Jewish community, the grown ups, the adults, teach them some form of a trade, because they were saying, in case you have to leave ina hurry, how are you going to support yourself unless you have a trade, something that you can do with your hands.</sentence><sentence id="297">So there was -- a few courses were set up in a club that we had, like photography, like working with the leather, tailoring.</sentence><sentence id="298">I know my sister took up sewing and she learned pretty well how to sew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Which sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="311"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0038 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: My older sister.</sentence><sentence id="313">Her name was Blanca, named after my paternal grandmother.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="314">Anyway, she -- she was very young in those days, too, but she learned how to sew and later on she really made -- made her living sewing and even during the war, when we would get some pictures from her, she would show us the same dress that she had changed and every year it's look different.</sentence><sentence id="315">That was the only dress she owned.</sentence><sentence id="316">Anyway, SO we -- we sort of saw that things were not going too well in the rest of the world, for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="317">And we were conscious, so this learning a trade was one thing --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: J-Just to clarify, this is the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> saying to each other, we must learn a trade and we will therefore provide these courses?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Well --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: It wasn't anybody else?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: No, more than the people in the com -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, the organized Jewish community would engage some tradesmen to teach the trades.</sentence><sentence id="323">Like maybe on Tuesdays and Thursdays, there would be electrical trade and the carpentry and leather --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Preparation?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="493">Q: I want to shift now, to what you remember about your parents actually making plans so that you and your father could leave at a moment's notice.</sentence><sentence id="494">You mentioned in your first interview, that you actually had little rucksacks, little backpacks packed.</sentence><sentence id="495">Can you remember how that came about and the actual packing of them?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="515">Q: Well, one reason I think it's -- it's probably okay to skip some, is because of your</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: So, if there's something you would like to say, that would be fine, but I -- I think that</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="530">probably it would be okay to -- to skip and try to fill in just some of that detail.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="531">A: Oh, okay.</sentence><sentence id="532">No, there's n-nothing special that I needed to or wanted to add, but I was just trying to give it perspective, and -- well, and our departure was preceded by when the Italian government fell.</sentence><sentence id="533">Of course, the -- the Italian army was let go, you know.</sentence><sentence id="534">This mis -- the general population just rushed the -- the what do you call it, we call them kasir -- kasirna, which is the <span class="BUILDING">military complex</span> that was right in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where the m -- the s-soldiers lived.</sentence><sentence id="535">Anyway, and it wa -- they had the storage of food there and ammunition, so everybody rushed there.</sentence><sentence id="536">I was watching people carrying bags of flour</sentence><sentence id="538">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 18 and wheat and you know, all kinds of canned stuff.</sentence><sentence id="539">An-Anyway, so then the partisans came to the surface and it was -- before that, it was underground.</sentence><sentence id="540">Now, there was enough partisans, they came from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, they organized the local population and there was partisan units marching through the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="541">If | can mention, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- I call it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but it was a city of 50,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="542">It was the biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span>, the coastal -- <span class="REGION">coastal area</span> and much of the interior.</sentence><sentence id="543">It was the, I guess the capital of the -- like we have states, they had these -- well, there was -- <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was subdivided into -- it's not kingdo -- the <span class="COUNTRY">kingdom</span> was the whole count -- I will have to remember this word, the translation of the word later.</sentence><sentence id="544">And -- But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span> was the capital of one of these, call them states, if -- until I get a better term for it.</sentence><sentence id="545">And so it was a pretty large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="546">I mean, I remember with pride, looking at the big, tall <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, eight <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>, nine floors, another one, you know.</sentence><sentence id="547">So, i-it was wide <span class="DLF">avenues</span>, <span class="DLF">tree line avenues</span>, you know, all that.</sentence><sentence id="548">So, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was sizable and now we saw all these -- the partisans and their insignia was a red star and -- on the cap it was a -- like a military cap, you know, with a red star in front of it.</sentence><sentence id="549">And the population started participating, and they would have these meetings, town meetings and you would get maybe 5,000 people show up for the meeting and there was somebody speaking about, you know, we have to arm ourselves and we have to chase the occupation and we're -- have to do this and that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="550">So there was a lot of enthusiasm.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="Question"><p><sentence id="584">Q: This is after the Italian soldiers left, but before any Germans came in?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="585">A: That is -- That is correct.</sentence><sentence id="586">This was like a -- maybe what, 20 day, about three weeks in there, where the partisans were able to hold on to this quote, major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="587">So, that was -- was like pretty wild and also like the partisans would conduct trials of the people who had collaborated and in -- there would be signs and you know, posters saying how many were convicted and shot and all that.</sentence><sentence id="588">It was -- maybe it was <span class="BUILDING">kangaroo court</span> type, it was very swift and pretty -- I won't say brutal, but it was swift and final for many people who had collaborated.</sentence><sentence id="589">It was a very sharp division.</sentence><sentence id="590">You're either with us or you're with them kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="591">So the population had committed themselves.</sentence><sentence id="592">And then there was -- the German troops were trying to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, but they were hel -- they were held in check at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Turks were held in check several hundred years earlier, the Ottoman empire was held, because it's such a terrain, the rough terrain, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and cliffs, that you can position yourself and you know, it was that kind of warfare that people could establishing -- establish themself and prevent even motorized units and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> from advancing.</sentence><sentence id="593">So, partisans were able to hold off the German troops for a very long time.</sentence><sentence id="594">And in those days, we were wondering what will happen if the partisans don't hold the <span class="DLF">line</span> and the Germans do come.</sentence><sentence id="595">And we didn't know -- We didn't think of an if, we were thinking of when, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="596">And that's -- in those days, we just did what everybody was aware that had to be done, namely prepare, so you can make a quick getaway by whatever means.</sentence><sentence id="597">Some people were thinking of getting a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> that were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">But that wasn't so safe, because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and</sentence><sentence id="600">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 20 Croatians that were armed by the Germans, the puppet government, they had better means than the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="601">Partisans were living off the support that they could get from general population.</sentence><sentence id="602">But Germans were pretty rough if they caught somebody helping the partisans, they burned the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="603">And later on, I remember seeing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, just everything -- no <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> on it, because the <span class="DLF">roof</span> was burned, you know.</sentence><sentence id="604">The rest was made out of stone, or bricks, so it couldn't burn, but i-it was -- or, if maybe partisans would kill a German person, the German would just take hundred at random and shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="605">That -- They -- They wouldn't have to be guilty or they wouldn't have to be partisans or anything, just hundred citizens, or hundred men, ju -- o-out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they would take them at random, put them against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="606">So -- Okay, so we are in this situation where everybody's wondering -- you know, the partisans said you have to be either with us or with them, and during those 20 days, lots of people said, "We're with the partisans."</sentence><sentence id="607">So when the Germans were coming, then all of these people who had declared themselves to be with the partisans, had to find a way to leave.</sentence><sentence id="608">And the Jewish population, of course, would be the first victims of the German onslaught.</sentence><sentence id="609">And Germans were bad enough, but Croatians were worse.</sentence><sentence id="610">So -- Anyway, so we were just cognizant of these [indecipherable] and we were ready -- what did it take?</sentence><sentence id="611">Not much.</sentence><sentence id="612">I mean, it's just, like my father had a bigger backpack, I remember and he put a, you know, a sweater, a pair of shoes, some underwear and there was some, I remember, I don't know if you know what zwieback is?</sentence><sentence id="613">It's a hard, hard -- it's not bread, it's like a, yeah, crust of some sort.</sentence><sentence id="614">Anyway, so I know he had brought that.</sentence><sentence id="615">He was in the military, the</sentence><sentence id="617">USHMM

impossible.</sentence><sentence id="618">So he put those in his, you know, backpack and of course we put -- we all, each kid had something that they made ready and after we left, my other sisters, my

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="660">Q: Was this in the 20 day period?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="662">A: In the 20 day period, yeah, but we had learned -- my parents had learned that she was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> before

it's discovered.</sentence><sentence id="685">There was -- There were a few things going on, you know, like occasionally leaflets would be distributed by people like her and they -- also there was armed -- armed attacks on the occupation troops and I know -- I could tell what -- something happened because next day or immediately, there would be curfew imposed and even if it happened during a

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="729">A: Well, okay.</sentence><sentence id="730">When -- On this crucial night, I guess, we were awakened by the neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="731">These were the good neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="732">They came knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, banging, and I remember, "Mr. Danon, Mr. Danon," and, "the Germans are coming."</sentence><sentence id="733">So we got up, took me three seconds to get dressed, my father got dressed and we grabbed our backpacks, which as I mentioned earlier, were packed with whatever we thought was important and that we could carry.</sentence><sentence id="734">Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="735">And also, my father and my mother had subdivided whatever valuables they had.</sentence><sentence id="736">In those days, one didn't carry too much cash, because was losing value, so people would buy -- they called them Napoleons.</sentence><sentence id="737">It's like a 20 dollar gold piece, it's about this size.</sentence><sentence id="738">And you -- They would sew them in the coats and clothes, so they thought that nobody was going to find them, you know, but everybody knew the -- where to find, in case they were caught by the Germans or the Ustashis.</sentence><sentence id="739">So -- But anyway, they subdivided what they had and I said goodbye to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="740">I don't believe my two younger sister were up at the time.</sentence><sentence id="741">We got out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it was, of course,

id="750">It was near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, you know, flat land and then the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, just all at once, straight up.</sentence><sentence id="751">So we started walking in that direction and little by little we heard voices and others joined us.</sentence><sentence id="752">It was a mass exodus, because others had heard the same rumor

rough.</sentence><sentence id="756">I had a good pair of shoes, because my father had just bought himself, me and my sis -- older sister, a pair of shoes -- didn't buy them, but he engaged a shoemaker to make them for us, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="757">And they were like the ski type, you know, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, the snow.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="758"><span

time and there was a bunch of guys.</sentence><sentence id="802">Later I learned they were partisans, but they sort of pretended they were fishermen.</sentence><sentence id="803">And they invited me if I wanted some food, they were cooking something.</sentence><sentence id="804">Wasn't beans, was -- they call it Ourzo, but it's -- that's a f -- it's not a wheat, it's a form of a -- what do you

beings.</sentence><sentence id="809">Anyway, so I remember that's what they served and that's what they ate and that's what they gave me some of.</sentence><sentence id="810">And they were talking about what are they going to do next day and what -- what unit of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ustashis</span> they were going to attack, you know.</sentence><sentence id="811">And I remember, as I traveled through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, like in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> that were held by the partisans, big point of conversation, you know, would be -- somebody would read the accomplishment of some other units, someplace.</sentence><sentence id="812">This wasn't organized military, this was just somebody in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had attacked Ustashi unit, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ustashi sympathizers town</span> and had burned so many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and taken so many sheep.</sentence><sentence id="813">These were <span class="REGION">pastoral areas</span>, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, but still, sheeps were the primary source of

id="817">Well, "How many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rifles</span> do we have?</sentence><sentence id="818">There is 12 of us, we have three rifles, well," you know, "how much ammunition?</sentence><sentence id="819">Maybe we</sentence><sentence id="821"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0038 28 can get some more guns," you know.</sentence><sentence id="822">So that's where they would go.</sentence><sentence id="823">Sometimes they were successful, sometimes not.</sentence><sentence id="824">But anyway, so, this how we traveled for -- I don't visualize right now, how many days or weeks, but we ended up -- I mean, through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, but we ended up again, near the <span class="DLF">coastline</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">I was with my father.</sentence><sentence id="826">And there was one of these wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">junks</span>, was going -- everybody was getting on it, so we got on it.</sentence><sentence id="827">And went to one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and I will give you the spelling of the name.</sentence><sentence id="828">H-v-a-r, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hvar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">That's -- That's where I spent a very major part of my time with the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="830">So anyway, we went there in the morning -- I mean, this was all -- everything -- movements are made during the night.</sentence><sentence id="831">Day is for

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="866">Q: When you and your father left to go join the partisans, how -- what kind of decision was that?</sentence><sentence id="867">Was that a political decision, to go fight the good fight, or was it more a decision to -- to s -- to make sure that you and your father would not have to come face to face with the Nazis, to be safe, or how would you characterize the decision?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="870">A: Well, the decision to fight never entered my mind nor my father's mind.</sentence><sentence id="871">Yeah, that was my older sister.</sentence><sentence id="872">We were trying to save our skins, frankly.</sentence><sentence id="873">My father, let's see, how old was he at the time?</sentence><sentence id="874">I would say he was 40, and he had fought in the -- this war that was brought to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="875">They had general mobilization and he -- he didn't have very pleasant memories from that.</sentence><sentence id="876">I mean, he was in there long enough, but I know he didn't care for the experience.</sentence><sentence id="877">And I was much too young.</sentence><sentence id="878">I was 13 years old, you</sentence><sentence id="880"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0038 29 know.</sentence><sentence id="881">I wasn't going to fight anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="882">So we just left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when we heard the Germans are coming, and there was no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go but the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="883">And if you joined the partisans, you're -- hopefully, you're with some -- some organize group.</sentence><sentence id="884">Otherwise, you're on your own, and how do you survive on your own in a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="885">And again, the general population of that <span class="REGION">area</span> was peasant.</sentence><sentence id="886">You know, they live off the <span class="REGION">land</span>, either as shepherds or as farmers.</sentence><sentence id="887">Once you got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, there was not much farming, except maybe around your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="888">No extensive farming of any kind, anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="889">In the <span class="REGION">lowlands</span>, where I lived, they had like -- grapes was the big thing.</sentence><sentence id="890">And fruit, fruit, different kind.</sentence><sentence id="891"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Figs</span>, peaches, cherries.</sentence><sentence id="892">But figs was a big fruit and grapes -- many, many of the people, they live off the grapes.</sentence><sentence id="893">They -- you know, there's a lot of work that goes in to this and th -- once they collect the grapes and squish them for a wine.</sentence><sentence id="894">You know, st -- stomp it and whatever they do.</sentence><sentence id="895">We all have seen movies how that's done.</sentence><sentence id="896">I used to see that done personally, all our neighbors were that, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="897">Anyway, so after that, it's nothing else to do the rest of the year.</sentence><sentence id="898">Well, anyway, so my father was a city dweller, if you will, and he couldn't survive in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, among the -- the suther way of life, you know.</sentence><sentence id="899">So, he was out of <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I guess the entire Jewish community would be out of place in the rural -- well, more than rural, it's in the peasant type environment, you know.</sentence><sentence id="900">Farming or sheep-herding or animal, you know, life, because they were not accustomed to it.</sentence><sentence id="901">There is -- Just to dissuade anybody that -- that's in the Jewish genes, they proved in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that they can be good farmers and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="902">But in this type of situation, we didn't have that background.</sentence><sentence id="903">So,</sentence><sentence id="905">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 30 anyway, we came to the partisans to be a part of a organized society, where we could survive and of course, make our contribution, whatever is needed.</sentence><sentence id="906">And we were accepted, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="907">There was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for everybody and once we got into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hvar</span>, they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me, too, and I was still 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="908">I was placed in a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span>, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="909">That's -- That's the best -- the best description of it.</sentence><sentence id="910">But <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> was making -- well, we were repairing ammunition, we were even making some of the things for the mi -- for the partisans, for the military or partisans.</sentence><sentence id="911">I remember, oh there were two kids younger than me in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="912">We were three kids assigned to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="913">One was 11 year old, and one was 12.</sentence><sentence id="914">All f -- All came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>, similar route that we came.</sentence><sentence id="915">What we were doing, actually, is generating power.</sentence><sentence id="916">It's a -- like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, you would just go, you know, drive this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stationary bike</span>, but would generate power for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> that they had.</sentence><sentence id="917">We would fill the batteries, you know, we would do -- and we would also stoke the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>, you know, for the -- the guy -- blacksmiths, you know.</sentence><sentence id="918">They weren't shoeing horses, they were making things out of -- well, let's say the guns -- I mean the weapons needed certain parts, steel part, they -- they wouldn't have it.</sentence><sentence id="919">They take a piece of steel and -- and by hand and hammer, you know.</sentence><sentence id="920">Get it into the [indecipherable] and just beat it and grind it and make the part, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, you know.</sentence><sentence id="921">And they would fix rifles, they would fix machine guns, occasionally, you know.</sentence><sentence id="922">And I remember they even had a big searchlight that came to be fixed.</sentence><sentence id="923">And we, the kids were doing -- even our job was making -- what the -- would you call it, it was for disinfecting clothes or whatever for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="924">You take -- We would take a barrel of the -- for oil</sentence><sentence id="926">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 31 barrel, split it in half -- and this was pretty heavy steel, split it in half, and finish up th -- with the -- I don't know -- I didn't -- don't know in English how you call these things to - - like a file.</sentence><sentence id="927">Yeah, file it down, fix it so it doesn't scratch.</sentence><sentence id="928">Then we would take a metal sheet, roll it and we would make grooves on both ends, so y-you have like roll.</sentence><sentence id="929">And beat the ends together, then we cut a piece for the bottom, make holes in it.</sentence><sentence id="930">So this was a barrel inside the barrel and on one you would put water and the other one would hold it closed, because steam gives you more heat to kill the germs.</sentence><sentence id="931">You couldn't just boil it because you only get 212 in boiling water, 212 degrees, but steam, you can really make it, I don't know what, 400 - 500, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="932">So this was one of the jobs that we, the kids, did.</sentence><sentence id="933">But these other kids used to tell stories about how they would, before they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hvar</span>, they were engaged in real battles, Germans and the Ustashi were -- had these <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and the kids job was to sneak, crawl on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and then just lob hand grenade into the small <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="934">And they could do it very silently, so they would not be detected.</sentence><sentence id="935">So the kids were useful for that, wher -- whereas grownup per -- person would be detected much easier, the kid knew how to wiggle his way to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and do this kind of job.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1996">But the only reason I mention it, is because I wanted to convey to whoever I was talking to, that this was the administration that was in charge of us, the very same one that was in charge of the Japanese, and I -- my guess was going to be that they -- the Japanese were - - Japanese Americans were treated just as well as we were.</sentence><sentence id="1997">I couldn't see any reason why they wouldn't ha-have been.</sentence><sentence id="1998">But, basically, it was the same administration, was called War Relocation Authority.</sentence><sentence id="1999">And then for us, they had a separate segment, it was called <span class="BUILDING">emergency refugee center</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2000">But it was the same administration.</sentence><sentence id="2001">You know, they had the same machinery in motion.</sentence><sentence id="2002">So, that's the only reason I mentioned it, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2010">Q: Can you talk -- You alluded to it a little bit ago, can you talk about the transition from leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ontario</span>, to having to really strike out and set up life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="2012">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 60 -- and tell us some of the things that happened right before you left, and -- and sort of take us through that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2016">A: Well, what happened to us was, I mean, we had to leave and we all left.</sentence><sentence id="2017">We were sent to <span

funding -- in other words, they guarantee that -- they guarantee that we would not become a public charge.</sentence><sentence id="2022">So, what they were trying to do is, people who are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they were trying to disperse them, so they wouldn't all go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, because they had the mechanism to take care of people, but not if they all go to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, because that's a big burden on one <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2023">So, they interviewed

in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, there is a <span class="BUILDING">Sephardic synagogue</span>, which is on the historic sites today, but it was the second <span

thought he would going to be near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2032">Well, close enough, but not exactly.</sentence><sentence id="2033">Anyway, so different people went to different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but I would say not too many went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha</span>, <span class="REGION">Nebraska</span>, or you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caspar</span>, <span class="REGION">Wyoming</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="2034">Still, it was either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LA</span>, <span

yeah, yeah --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2056">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 62 and from there we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and came to <span

that.</sentence><sentence id="2061">Well, eventually, he found us jobs -- I mean, he found us an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we moved to <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3637">Q: Lam very -- This is an interesting point, and I would like to know what you think about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: Okay, well, first of all, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was created from all these different, southern Slavs.</sentence><sentence id="3640">Many were under Turkish occupations and others, even more, were under Austro- Hungary empire.</sentence><sentence id="3641">And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were brought up differently.</sentence><sentence id="3642">They had different religions, different scripts and different</sentence><sentence id="3644">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 106 history.</sentence><sentence id="3645">So they were not the same kind.</sentence><sentence id="3646">Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came from the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls and agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these people.</sentence><sentence id="3647">Divide and conquer, it's a old expression and it's -- it was true.</sentence><sentence id="3648">So <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and the Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so there was -- the conflict was being raised.</sentence><sentence id="3649">They were supported -- <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> was supported by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, of course, because that's the big brother, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and was supported also by <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3650">So there was that inner conflict.</sentence><sentence id="3651">Now, what we call <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> today, actually it's <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Herzegovina</span> -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part.</sentence><sentence id="3652">Anyway, these were just two little provinces.</sentence><sentence id="3653">As far as I know, they never had a political autonomy.</sentence><sentence id="3654">And they were shuffled back and forth between <span class="REGION">Turkish empire</span> and Austro- Hungarian empire.</sentence><sentence id="3655">At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro- Hungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods.</sentence><sentence id="3656">Anyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the outside powers.</sentence><sentence id="3657">So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the supreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian authority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs, too.</sentence><sentence id="3658">And that was in everybody's mind after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3659">So Tito, when he became the leader of the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other.</sentence><sentence id="3660">And whatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia,</sentence><sentence id="3662"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0038 107 whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3663">Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="3664">And he was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic.</sentence><sentence id="3665">He allowed anything that worked for him, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free ownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that.</sentence><sentence id="3666">But anyway, I knew when he would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn't build a natural succe-succession force.</sentence><sentence id="3667">He did provide the mechanism, but no way to enforce it, because the control of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was with the secret police and the army and he didn't have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was gone.</sentence><sentence id="3668">But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians declared themselves independent, first it was <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span>, and the Yugoslav army tried to put down the insurrection, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="3669">And they were not successful, because they had to cross <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and it was not the most effective way of conducting a war.</sentence><sentence id="3670">So <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span> succeeded in seceding from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3671">Then when <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and they -- they took over the power.</sentence><sentence id="3672">And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I want to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government, under this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3673">He's -- I guess he's a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein.</sentence><sentence id="3674">But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of taking, let's say <span class="REGION">territory</span>, they would just go there and destroy.</sentence><sentence id="3675">Like, that was their way of discouraging, but not a very civilized way.</sentence><sentence id="3676">But anyway, the Croatians were not very civilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that's all evil, it's all around and which one is</sentence><sentence id="3678">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0038 108 the worst, and in my mind, I say Croatians are worse than the others.</sentence><sentence id="3679">But unfortunately for my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were there, we were in a position to pacify that <span class="REGION">area</span>, we didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="3680">In fact, whatever we did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker's rule.</sentence><sentence id="3681">Jim Baker, he was George Bush's Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was acting in that position.</sentence><sentence id="3682">So, I didn't like what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3683"><span class="COUNTRY">Libya</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> were sending arms to Bosnians, to the <span class="REGION">Moslem side</span> and of course, they had no way to get the arms through, except through American controlled areas.</sentence><sentence id="3684">So we just let them and the Croatians would take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half.</sentence><sentence id="3685">And that encouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting.</sentence><sentence id="3686">And I think we picked the wrong <span class="NPIP">side</span> in that conflict.</sentence><sentence id="3687">We could have pacified it, we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3688">And that's my viewpoint.</sentence></p></dialogue>
