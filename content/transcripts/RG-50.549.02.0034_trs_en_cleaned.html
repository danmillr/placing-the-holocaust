<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Okay, thank you.</sentence><sentence id="26">One of the things you mentioned in the video interview was that your grandfather had some poison that you were to have used if things got really unbearable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: When did you find out about the fact that he had this poison and what were the circumstances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="36"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0034 3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: I do not exactly remember when the subject was brought up.</sentence><sentence id="38">I simply do not remember.</sentence><sentence id="39">It -- It, in all likelihood was mentioned casually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: But it -- it -- it re -- it came up while you were on the run -- while you were --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Yes, yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="46">It wasn't later, when --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: No, it was -- it was -- it was while we were on the run.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Do you remember your reaction to finding out about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: No, I don't remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: Another thing having to do with the video was your time in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanage</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: And you had said that you weren't really aware of religion at that age, but there were a lot of different experiences with religion, that you had.</sentence><sentence id="57">You had the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanage</span>, you-your own religion.</sentence><sentence id="58">Were you aware of -- of your <span class="NPIP">place</span> in any of this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: I do not think that I was bothered by it, because during the war, I was about a half a year or eight months, hidden under assumed name in -- in the parish of a Lutheran minister, so that somehow I was used to Christianity, as far as that goes.</sentence><sentence id="63">But, when I was deposited in that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, it was already after liberation -- very shortly after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="64">And my parents made it clear to me that I will be there only a very short time and I can only assume that the nuns were instructed that I'm there only temporarily, for a couple days or weeks.</sentence><sentence id="65">So they have not tried to impose any of their influence upon me.</sentence><sentence id="66">It was like -- like, if you will, to -- to -- to be deposited in a <span class="BUILDING">day care center</span>, if you wish.</sentence><sentence id="67">There was one fellow I befriended there, during those few days.</sentence><sentence id="68">He used to -- he spend there a whole war.</sentence><sentence id="69">He was Jewish, but he was not circumcised, so there</sentence><sentence id="71">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 4 was apparently no way t -- of proving that he was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="72">But that -- that didn't have any lasting influence upon me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: When the war ended, you were 13.</sentence><sentence id="86">You were in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: And since the video interview stopped at that point --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: -- perhaps we could pick up the chronology and -- and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: -- talk about that period as the war ended and what was going on in your life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="98">After some very short time in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, one of my relatives -- and I don't remember exactly whether it was my sister or my parents, came to pick me up and we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarrishbrote</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uerskibrote</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from which we fled in 1942, to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">If I remember correctly, in those -- in that period that I was in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, my parents succeeded having our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> returned to us.</sentence><sentence id="100">Because, during the war, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was occupied by Christians, who were not very pleased, apparently, to vacate the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="101">Because majority Christians who found themselves into those situations, assumed that the Jews have perished.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="102">That they will be able to stay there forever.</sentence><sentence id="103">So, we returned to our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">I remember, after few days or weeks, I joined the Boy Scouts.</sentence><sentence id="105">I had got -- got a nasty infection on my foot and had to be operated on and had to be transported for the operation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarishradish</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werskaradishka</span>, which had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">And the only doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarishbrote</span> who was available, said that because the war has ended such a short while earlier, they didn't had any ether -- anesthesia, to put me to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="107">So I had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ungarishradish</span> for operation.</sentence><sentence id="108">I stayed there a couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="109">My father, in the meantime, traveled throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">Mainly --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="113"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0034 5 his <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> was confiscated by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="114">And the provisional Czech government wanted to return it to him, but of course, the original equipment, God knows where it disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="115">So, the government has said that they will give him a dental equipment left by fleeing Germans.</sentence><sentence id="116">So he can choose any <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> that he wants to, with one condition, that the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> will stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in which it is.</sentence><sentence id="117">And the Czech government promised to find for us an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="118">So, from what I understand, my father looked over about five or six <span class="BUILDING">dental offices</span> and has selected one in the city of Zenime or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, which is about one hour by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, in <span class="REGION">southern Moravia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">And in, I think September of "45, we have moved.</sentence><sentence id="120">Correction, it must have been later.</sentence><sentence id="121">October or November, we have moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">And while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uerskibrote</span>, I started getting private tutoring lessons, because I was still at a compulsory school age.</sentence><sentence id="123">And the debate was with the school board, whether I should be admitted to a class according to my chronological age or placed in a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> according to my academic knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="124">And until that issue was resolved -- because the local school board didn't had any instructions how to proceed.</sentence><sentence id="125">So, in the meantime, I was having a private tutor, so I think that during the summer of "45, I was spending it with a tutor.</sentence><sentence id="126">And in September, I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">In the meantime, the ruling was that I had to attend classes according to my chronological age.</sentence><sentence id="128">So, of course, I was -- I was totally unprepared, after four years -- five years being out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">So I -- I always had very poor grades as a result.</sentence><sentence id="130">And then my father selected the <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, so we have moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">I remember the travel throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was an ordeal, because th-the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were not only filthy and dirty, but all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken.</sentence><sentence id="132">And it was -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running, God knows how.</sentence><sentence id="133">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> -- the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, I think at that time, it -- it must have had a population of about 20,000, was heavily scarred from Germans fleeing to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">There were several burn out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> left over in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">A great part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span></sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="139"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0034 6 was in ruins.</sentence><sentence id="140">And almost all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span> were broken, because allies were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">And <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Noiseshtatel</span>, which had apparently <span class="BUILDING">German ammunition factories</span>, and from the vibration of the bombs, the glass of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> simply broke.</sentence><sentence id="142">So, then I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, I think til about 1947.</sentence><sentence id="143">Yes, in May of 1947, I finished my compulsory educational requirements, which at that time, were nine grades.</sentence><sentence id="144">I did not qualify for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, simply because of academic deficiencies.</sentence><sentence id="145">And the fact that I was Jewish and suffered from a lack of education was not taken into account.</sentence><sentence id="146">And in 1947, the problem was asked, okay, what do I do now?</sentence><sentence id="147">The city of 20,000 people did not have many opportunities for young people.</sentence><sentence id="148">There were a couple <span class="DLF">openings</span> in various <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trades</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">In the Czech economy at that time, usually somebody who selected a trade went into apprenticeship status for next three years.</sentence><sentence id="150">So, there were openings if you wanted to become a barber or a painter or a sales clerk.</sentence><sentence id="151">All those trades are -- required three years apprenticeship.</sentence><sentence id="152">But somehow it came to my attention that a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> was looking for apprenticeship connected with bort and learning classes.</sentence><sentence id="153">So, the whole picture came -- began to look like a two year long apprenticeship, with half a day of practical work in a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> and half a day of classroom work.</sentence><sentence id="154">I succeeded, with my father's help, to enter the program and left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in which there was a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">I-It used to be owned by Jews.</sentence><sentence id="156">And I started as an apprentice in -- in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I believe that the program was the first year.</sentence><sentence id="157">We were to rotate in the <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span>, from department to department and the second year you should have selected a department, which would become your specialty.</sentence><sentence id="158">So I finished the first year, but even during the first year, I still had physical problems, because I was extremely weak as a result of the war.</sentence><sentence id="159">Furthermore, I never felt quite <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because I was the only Jewish apprentice in our class of about 60.</sentence><sentence id="160">So I was sort of a curiosity.</sentence><sentence id="161">And I finished, I think, first half of the second year, when my parents suggested that -- by that time, it was 1948.</sentence><sentence id="162">The</sentence></p><p><sentence id="165">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 7 Communists already took over the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when my parents came to me with the question whether I would be willing to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">Do you have any --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Yes, that's a good point to go back and -- and ask you questions about that period.</sentence><sentence id="168">Did -- Did you feel, because you were behind in your schooling, did -- did that make you feel -- a-and your experience was different from others in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, I -- I assume, so wh -- did you feel alienated or -- or set apart from -- from your -- your classmates?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: 1-- I do not think that I felt alienated from my classmates, maybe because all of them were on the nine year track, rather than on the 12 year track.</sentence><sentence id="170">And simply, they were too young to have had first hand experience with the Nazis or Jews, because they grew up under normal conditions, with the exception of -- of -- of the war years.</sentence><sentence id="171">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, a great percentage of the students in the nine -- in -- in -- in the lower grades, commuted from neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">And they were sons of farmers, who basically didn't feel the war in the same fashion like people who were living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">Because in the -- in the <span class="REGION">outlying areas</span>, you know, the Nazis didn't had such a tight control like over the population of -- of -- of larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="180">Who were most of -- who were your friends?</sentence><sentence id="181">Did you make close friend during that period?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: I made some friends, simply because -- I got to tell you something, I was not tremendously interested in catching up with my academic deficiencies, simply because I didn't had a -- a specific goal in mind.</sentence><sentence id="186">While I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, it never occurred to me, "Gosh, in -- in a year or two I will be finished, what do I do then?"</sentence><sentence id="187">It -- It never occurred to me.</sentence><sentence id="188">I -- during the war, because of my being locked up always in -- in <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, I had tremendous energy, which first had to be satisfied.</sentence><sentence id="189">And, as a result, I played soccer.</sentence><sentence id="190">I was very good at soccer.</sentence><sentence id="191">Although, because of my physical -- being physically weak, I didn't -- I wasn't able to run for a</sentence><sentence id="193"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0034 8 long time.</sentence><sentence id="194">But still, 1 was a very good soccer player in my own group of youngsters.</sentence><sentence id="195">So, most of the time, I tried to catch up on the physical activities, which I missed during the war, rather than on the <span class="REGION">emotional side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">The physical deficiencies came to me more naturally than the academic development.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: What were some of the physical ailments?</sentence><sentence id="210">You said you were weak --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: [had, several times, very bad ear infection.</sentence><sentence id="212">You see, in those days, although penicillin was all ready -- after the war, was already invented, but it was question of availability.</sentence><sentence id="213">So that was -- that was problem number one.</sentence><sentence id="214">Then, when, during your formative years, you are continuously locked up, your body does not get the opportunity to develop physically.</sentence><sentence id="215">And consequently, I -- I was weak, physically and undernourished.</sentence><sentence id="216">So all that, first of all, I had to catch up with.</sentence><sentence id="217">I don't know what I ever caught up.</sentence><sentence id="218">Basically, I will tell you something, I think that I caught up with most of the deficiencies, but I was always out of sync.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Did you talk with your -- your mates and -- and your schoolmates and friends about your experience during the Holocaust -- during the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="222">Nobody was particularly interested in it.</sentence><sentence id="223">At one time one of my teachers suggested that I write a book.</sentence><sentence id="224">But, you know, coming to a 13 year old boy with a task, why don't you write a book about your experiences, didn't -- didn't sit with me quite, quite well.</sentence><sentence id="225">I didn't see any purpose for it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="226">Because it's -- it's completely different than looking at it in hindsight, 50 years, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: You would think that s -- that some of your friends would -- would be curious or -- or perhaps you would be wanting to tell them because there was an adventure about -- I mean, there was partly an adventure.</sentence><sentence id="234">I mean it ma-may not have felt that way to you, but if I were a classmate and</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="241">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 9 Thad a friend who'd -- who had done what you did during the war, I might be curious about hearing -- hearing about it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="242">A: I don't think -- I don't think that the issue was ever -- ever raised.</sentence><sentence id="243">You know, okay, I'm -- I'm -- you are right, had it happened now.</sentence><sentence id="244">But don't forget, you have to project yourself to those days.</sentence><sentence id="245"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, for example, looking in hindsight, had only small number of newspapers that were all published in the capital city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">I don't remember ever seeing a <span class="BUILDING">local newspaper</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247"><span class="BUILDING">Television</span> didn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="248">Radio -- those people who could afford a radio, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had only two or three <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> which had three or four times a day news, the news were mostly of international nature.</sentence><sentence id="249">So that news penetrated very, very slowly at -- int - - to the population.</sentence><sentence id="250">Usually news that was of local importance appeared on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin board</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">Every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had, on -- in the major <span class="DLF">streets</span>, had big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin boards</span>, where some officials used to paste announcements.</sentence><sentence id="252">But otherwise, you simply didn't know what is happening, unless you heard it over the radio, or if you knew a foreign language, to listen to Radio Vienna or -- or -- or some adjacent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, listening to the news that way.</sentence><sentence id="253">So that people didn't know exactly, what was happening -- what happened in the past.</sentence><sentence id="254">And I do not think that people were all that curious to find out somebody else's experiences.</sentence><sentence id="255">Maybe -- Maybe -- Maybe people -- don't forget that Christians in -- in those days, after the war, felt guilty.</sentence><sentence id="256">Because the Judaism in -- in -- in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, the anti-Semitism was more of a religious character.</sentence><sentence id="257">We Jews were not so much despised by the Czechs because we were wealthy or -- or -- or -- or more successful, but whenever the word Jew was thrown into my face, it was always labeled, you Christ killer.</sentence><sentence id="258">So, you know -- and that was after the war against the law.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: So, saying that was against the law?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="280"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0034 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Yes, against the Czech law, to point out that -- that expression.</sentence><sentence id="282">There was absolutely nothing forbidding to -- to be very antagonistic toward Gypsies, but the Jews were sheltered, as far as that goes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: Did -- Did you experience any blatant anti-Semitism during those years that you were [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: After the war.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: After the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: That was -- that was a little bit strange.</sentence><sentence id="344">My father and my mother had frequent fights, but I never knew exactly the nature of the fights, because they were all done in my absence.</sentence><sentence id="345">You know, children, if they're left out -- whenever something very serious took place, the children were sent out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, or parents waited for the children, while they were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, to -- to settle their differences.</sentence><sentence id="346">So there was a tension between my parents, but the tension was also caused, to a great deal, by my sister, who was no longer living with us.</sentence><sentence id="347">She was eight years older than I and she was trying to find her own way, recognizing that the c-city of Zenoimal d-does not have many opportunities to offer her.</sentence><sentence id="348">Furthermore, she was already marriage age, so she was living in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burno</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brinn</span>, working as a secretary -- steno for some <span class="BUILDING">firms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">So there were also tensions caused because of her.</sentence><sentence id="350">But overall, the time after the war was not -- before I left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, was not entirely smooth.</sentence><sentence id="351">And only later, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, I realized why.</sentence><sentence id="352">But by then, I was already thousands of miles away, not being in the position to influence the situation one way or the other.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="372">I have met with part of that group.</sentence><sentence id="373">Neither one of -- of the group was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zenoimal</span>, they all were dispersed throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, but these individuals were already together a year or two in preparation for pioneering life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="374">So, I was attached to that group.</sentence><sentence id="375">And that group belonged to a very left oriented political party.</sentence><sentence id="376">It was almost Communism.</sentence><sentence id="377">That -- the group had aimed to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and supplement membership of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> -- very left oriented kibbutz.</sentence><sentence id="378">And I felt extremely uncomfortable after arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> type surrounding.</sentence><sentence id="379">Because, I was exposed to the Communist propaganda in 1948 and I was able to realize that the Russians were extremely anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="380">So, I began to realize that I fled Communism of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, just to come into a different form of Communism in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">But it -- it -- it was not initiated in my mind by -- so much by politics, but by various actions of that group, to which I supposedly had to conform to their way of life.</sentence><sentence id="382">For example, all the personal clothes -- clothing were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="383">They were all arranged in a group type -- <span class="BUILDING">communal type bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">You got clothing, two sets a week, depending on your size.</sentence><sentence id="385">You didn't know whose clothing

me.</sentence><sentence id="399">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0034 13 But I'm not quite certain, my father signed some documents, which legally obligated me to that group.</sentence><sentence

because April "49 was Passover and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Israeli ship</span> didn't wanted to sail during Passover holiday.</sentence><sentence id="408">So when we came to <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">From there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transition camp</span>, which again went against my grain because it had a <span

of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">That was still in "49 -- in April "49, when we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="414">It was not quite a year since establishment of state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, which I think came into existence in my -- May of "48.</sentence><sentence id="415">But then, the war with Arab nations took place, so I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> just shortly after the cease fire with the <span class="REGION">Arab nations</span> was signed.</sentence><sentence id="416">So there was still great deal of uncertainty
