like the edge burned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and in behind was our <span class="BUILDING">mill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">So we came back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">I opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">It was still eggs and butter and cheese from the night what we didn't finished our supper and what everything and all sugar and jam and everything because the war was going we didn't suspect that we will have to run away.</sentence><sentence id="136">So that was good for us, that we had right away everything.</sentence><sentence id="137">Also a cousin of mine moved in to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was burned and she actually saved this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because...with water...was no firemen at the time...so with water, with buckets of water she saved this fire shouldn't go farther.</sentence><sentence id="138">And we were again happy to stay.</sentence><sentence id="139">Right?</sentence><sentence id="140">As a child you ask me what I remember.</sentence><sentence id="141">I remember I was afraid to sleep in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> because after all...uh...the two, three weeks I didn't sleep in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">I was always sitting or lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">So I went to mine aunt, mine father's sister to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="144">She had a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and she had a girl, my cousin, mine age.</sentence><sentence id="145">And we like each other very much.</sentence><sentence id="146">I said I would sleep with my cousin Hilda, and I don't want to sleep at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">So my mother said, "Fine."</sentence><sentence id="148">Oh...and at the time my mother came also to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> back.</sentence><sentence id="149">And I ran around to my aunt's to see if everybody is alive, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a square and a lot of Germans in it.</sentence><sentence id="150">And I was very much afraid and people were running up to the Germans with a cigarette to sell bread or something and I slept this night by my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="151">In the morning about 7 o'clock, my father came in and talked something to my aunt and I was very anxious to know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="152">And they didn't want to tell me...a child...what happened during the night.</sentence><sentence id="153">That the German with the Poles come into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they took out my cousin, the woman's husband who let...who saved this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from the fire with my father with mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno.</sentence><sentence id="154">They took him on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">They wanted money.</sentence><sentence id="156">So my father said he has no money.</sentence><sentence id="157">He has the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">And it's after the war and I don't have money.</sentence><sentence id="159">And the German...was few Germans, not only one...each one took a person like the three of them and start to beat them and start to scream they should run away.</sentence><sentence id="160">So my father was afraid to go to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> a tailor was living there, without children, a nice old Jewish poor people.</sentence><sentence id="161">So he went into them and he sat til the morning there.</sentence><sentence id="162">But he was afraid to tell my mother that he's alive.</sentence><sentence id="163">And it was the first night in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">So, of course, my mother was very upset in the morning and my father came to my aunt to tell her what's what...that from now on he will remain there too.</sentence><sentence id="165">It didn't took too long.</sentence><sentence id="166">It took about maybe 2 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="167">My father decided he's going to be free.</sentence><sentence id="168">He cannot live like this so he decided...he and my cousin and mine father's partner, Mr. Leshno will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">First, they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and later will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="170">They said goodbye to us and my mother was crying.</sentence><sentence id="171">She screamed, "I am already a widow.</sentence><sentence id="172">How do you leave me?"</sentence><sentence id="173">But he left the money and a lot of people owe us money also.</sentence><sentence id="174">So we remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with the maid.</sentence><sentence id="175">The maid had no <span class="NPIP">place where</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="176">It was a Jewish woman.</sentence><sentence id="177">She raised us and she was like a family with us, and we stood there.</sentence><sentence id="178">And my father disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="179">We didn't know what and where and what.</sentence><sentence id="180">Occasionally we got... mean my mother got...just had the news.</sentence><sentence id="181">My mother said, Oh, your father's fine and everything is alright.</sentence><sentence id="182">Maybe we'll some day be able to join him."</sentence><sentence id="183">So...uh...we stood together in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarezyn</span>, and nothing specially, you know.</sentence><sentence id="184">We lived without... just with the hope that we will join our father and maybe the Germans will let us live in peace.
