<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Mechanical engineer, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: And so next day, I came and we all went to see this Timisoara (ph).</sentence><sentence id="325">And he went along at my side, and he asked me, "What can we do here?</sentence><sentence id="326">What can we do here and here?"</sentence><sentence id="327">And I said, "It's very difficult, but we have to do whatever we can, and we will do."</sentence><sentence id="328">He said, "All right."</sentence><sentence id="329">So that was the beginning of my relationship with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yegendorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">He made me -- I have this document as a , the chief engineer.</sentence><sentence id="331">Chief engineer was a Mr. Bingerstratts (ph).</sentence><sentence id="332">He was the, how shall I say, the son-in-law of a very rich man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, who was on the .</sentence><sentence id="333"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yegendorf</span> was also on the .</sentence><sentence id="334">So this Bingerstratts was made chief engineer; I was his deputy.</sentence><sentence id="335">So we started little by little, we started to build up this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">Yegendorf was in the beginning a nice fellow, but the more power he got the more he became brutal.</sentence><sentence id="337">And he was intellectually a lightweight, but there were people around us, which certainly you know, there was a Dr. Kessler (ph), a lawyer, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Donetsk</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="338">He was a very, very clever man and a highly intelligent man.</sentence><sentence id="339">Kessler was his alter-ego for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yegendorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">If Kessler proposed what to do, Yegendorf signed and said, "I did it."</sentence><sentence id="341">And so it went with a lot of penchants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">People did a lot of things to survive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Can you explain how come this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span> (ph), this <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span>, was created?</sentence><sentence id="364">What was the interest of the Romanian authorities to create the <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> and why they wanted -- why they went ahead with this idea?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: Well, so far as I know, there was a lot of people, the prefect of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.8650543" long="30.3205315">Mogilev</span> had some people around himself that were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="368"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yegendorf</span> had some people around him that were also Jews.</sentence><sentence id="369">And they made business, one group with the other.</sentence><sentence id="370">In order to make business and that it should be something we make work for the benefit of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, so it was war.</sentence><sentence id="371">The Timisoara (ph), which could repair <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, tractors, and do other things, was very important for the Germans and for the Romanians.</sentence><sentence id="372">And besides, the great motive of this, I believe, was people -- the Romanians, the Prefect, the Major of the gendarmerie, who was -- they wanted to make business; they wanted to get rich.</sentence><sentence id="373">And my personal opinion is that this is our luck, because we could corrupt them with money and we could stay there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="381">Q: So if I understand when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.8650543" long="30.3205315">Mogilev</span> was practically a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, which had this <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span>, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Timisoara</span> (ph), as the main industrial unit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
