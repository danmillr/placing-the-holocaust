<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: So, I'm Arwen Donahue and we're here at the U.S. <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> and it's November 17, 1995.</sentence><sentence id="2">I'm here with Mr. Nicholas Winton.</sentence><sentence id="3">And Mr. Winton if you would state for me your date of birth and place of birth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I was born on the 19th of May 1909 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: And will you say something for me about your family background, what your father did, and your mother, and what you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father was a banker, Mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and was the first girl in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to take the Ivy tour which is the matriculation when that exam became open for girls.</sentence><sentence id="12">And she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after her marriage when she was very young.</sentence><sentence id="13">She was still 17.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: What was the atmosphere in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like in your early years?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: It was very... it was marvelous.</sentence><sentence id="20">We were in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which Father's parents had owned previously.</sentence><sentence id="21">It was an enormous <span class="BUILDING">20 room house</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">billiard table</span> in I remember, and yes we were happy there.</sentence><sentence id="22">It was in the north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span> and Father moved from banking after the war to importing glass from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">He joined a firm which imported glass.</sentence><sentence id="24">Yes, it was very as far as I can remember, a congenial atmosphere.</sentence><sentence id="25">Nearly 85 years ago now, so I don't know how much one genuinely remembers from one's childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: Now, you traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when you were fairly young, did you not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: Well, we traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on holiday because Mother's relatives were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">Mother's mother was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and brothers and sisters were still over there.</sentence><sentence id="37">And of course when Hitler arrived on the scene, so the family that had been still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started to come over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and of course Mother and Father were able to help them not only to come over but to...to look after them.</sentence><sentence id="38">They all stayed with us to start with before making their separate ways in the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: How would you describe.... were you aware of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, and did you know anything about him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: I think we did, because when Hitler came to power in 1933 I was 24 and I... from my youth I think I've always been very politically conscious and always very left wing and I joined all kinds of things which would have been protesting against things like Hitler represented.</sentence><sentence id="46">Yes, I think we were very aware of it from early on, especially having gone through the first world war also where you had that... not anti-semitic feeling, but</sentence><sentence id="48">certainly anti-German feeling in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">Later on, one had not only the anti-semitic but the anti-German feeling together.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: When you were... before you become a London stock broker, correct me if I'm wrong, you had traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to study banking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="60">Well, Father, as I said, had been a banker, and he thought that my career should be in banking, and that a little travel would do me good, and I was in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for a year and then six months with a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and then six months for the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and I would have gone on to do banking over here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> were it not for the big crash occurring in "29, and so Father thought it was about time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, instead of him spending money on me, and some of my own.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Were you interested in <span class="BUILDING">banking</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: Yes, I think I was interested in banking and finance, yes.</sentence><sentence id="66">I dare say I would have accomodated myself to any other profession I'd be put in, but banking seemed to suit me quite well, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: What are your recollections from those months that you spent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, political recollections?</sentence><sentence id="70">Did you witness persecution?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which would have been in 1930, I have no political recollections at all really.</sentence><sentence id="74">I mean I did banking, I made a lot of friends.</sentence><sentence id="75">I was good at <span class="DLF">fencing</span> and I was both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">local fencing club</span>, and met a lot of friends there-- and in fact I even fenced for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">At that time in 1930, there was a big match against <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, actually.</sentence><sentence id="77">I was on their team and I also owned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wansee</span> and spent the weekends boating.</sentence><sentence id="78">So at that time there was no -- I mean I wasn't interested in politics as such at that time and it was of course prior to... it was three years before Hitler even came on the scenes.</sentence><sentence id="79">So, no I wasn't in any way politically interested at that period.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: When would you say that your political awareness was focused?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: Well, I mean in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I was always politically aware of politics, but local politics, British politics.</sentence><sentence id="90">And it was really only slowly, after 1933, when the implications of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were known, that I became kind of interested in that.</sentence><sentence id="91">Because, as I say, I was always very interested in politics, and my friends were always very interested in politics, and we were all pretty well left-wing and we used to have meetings and discuss things so that really directly Hitler became a factor in European life.</sentence><sentence id="92">Yes, we were very interested in that, very.</sentence><sentence id="93">We became more so as he became more aggressive and took over more of Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Can you describe your friendship with Martin Blake?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: Well, Martin Blake had always been a friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="105">He was a master at <span class="BUILDING">Westminster School</span> in London, and he and I shared lots of interests, but chiefly political interests.</sentence><sentence id="106">We also liked winter sports, and he took a party of children to winter sports every year in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and I accompanied him which had the advantage of, for very little trouble or expense of energy, we got a free holiday.</sentence><sentence id="107">And, we were very close.</sentence><sentence id="108">We were always together and nearly always with other people who were discussing politics in some way or other reasonably left wing politics because there was a lot going on at that time as Hitler became more and more influential in Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Do you remember any of your discussions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Well, not in detail really no.</sentence><sentence id="117">They were anti- Hitler, though.</sentence><sentence id="118">I can't remember the details.</sentence><sentence id="119">The politics in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at that time were so complicated.</sentence><sentence id="120">You had the people who were very frightened about the rise in Hitler, and yet one of the biggest left-wing movements was the Peace Pledge Union which in a way was contrary to what was going on in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="121">So, it was a very curious period, which was highlighted later on, of course, by the way Chamberlain and other people dealt with the rise of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="122">They were also very schizophrenic about it.</sentence><sentence id="123">They didn't really know how... how to handle it.</sentence><sentence id="124">They still thought that... that this idea of peace could be maintained and... Very difficult to discuss the feeling in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at that time, because there were of course a lot of people like there were in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because of the rise, just because of the rise of left wing influence who were becoming more and more right wing.</sentence><sentence id="125">So, there were crowds of people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who at that time were very right-wing, as epitomized by Oswald Mosely and his people, whom I actually knew quite well at that time.</sentence><sentence id="126">He was in our <span class="BUILDING">fencing club</span>, Sir Oswald Mosely.</sentence><sentence id="127">He seemed quite inoffensive when he was <span class="DLF">fencing</span> but he commanded quite a political clout later on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Did you have particular ideas after the rise of Hitler of what should be done, what you wanted to do or that you felt you should do something in response?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, I think in a democracy the individual always feels rather powerless, you know.</sentence><sentence id="143">You could feel it and talk about it and discuss it but except voting for a government there was nothing one could really do about it.</sentence><sentence id="144">My political awareness of Hitler really was only crystallized when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and really saw for myself.</sentence><sentence id="145">One could see individually what was happening from time to time but there was little one could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="146">I mean, one is very powerless really, the individual in a democracy.</sentence><sentence id="147">And yes, we discussed it and we discussed the dangers of it, at the same time as this peace pledge movement was going on, so it was very curious situation at that time.</sentence><sentence id="148">But there were lots of people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who weren't that much frightened by Hitler at the time, you know, who felt that the danger wasn't Hitler at all.</sentence><sentence id="149">The danger was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">And a great many people at that time I don't think ever thought that we would really be in conflict with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because they thought that the politicians would be adept enough to see that the Germans fought <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and not us.</sentence><sentence id="151">In the event, of course, they fought both, but not in the order we expected.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Now, Martin Blake, at this time, was working with refugees, was he not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: No, no, Martin Blake really had nothing to do with refugees at all.</sentence><sentence id="168">Martin Blake knew a lot of people politically as well as of course his work for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he was very friendly with one lady Doreen Wariner who was the representative for the British Committee for <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and was given the job of going out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and heading a movement to try and save those who had arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and were politically endangered since the Germans... when the Germans... if the Germans arrived.</sentence><sentence id="169">That was of course after the... Hitler marched in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">And he rung me up one day just before he was setting off for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and said, "Look, I've cancelled my trip to winter sports so yours is cancelled too.</sentence><sentence id="171">I'm in a rush-- I can't tell you what's going on but meet me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and I'll tell you," and that's how I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">I really didn't know what I was in for when I left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: When was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: When was that?</sentence><sentence id="182">That was Christmas "38, "39.</sentence><sentence id="183">I don't know the actual dates anymore.</sentence><sentence id="184">That was Christmas "38, "39.</sentence><sentence id="185">And I went out and met him, Blake, one evening, I knocked him up at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel Sroubek</span> and he told me what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: What did he tell you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Well he told me that there was all these people who had come into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mostly after the Germans marched into Sudetenland, and that they were the Jews, they were the writers, they were those who were on Hitler's blacklist, and I think there were five separate groups, all of whom were endangered, and the job of Doreen Wariner and the British Committee was to try and rescue them and get them out to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">And at that time, of course, they were... a lot of the people were living with friends or relatives whom they knew in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> but a lot of them were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">And I went "round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to see what was going on, together with actually two ladies who were given into my custody to look after whilst I did these tours, and one was Eleanor Rathbone, the member of parliament, and the other was the Reverend Rosalind Lee, who was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Unitarian church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">And we toured "round these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the dead of winter and snow.</sentence><sentence id="197">It was all rather cold and pathetic to see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="198">And I suppose that's when my final... when more of my ideas about really what was going on in the continent were formed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Were these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> all located near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: The ones we saw were located near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">I remember we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> but whether we hired a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> or whether we were moved around I really can't remember but they were, yes, in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">They were Nissenhunt (ph) camps, and very over-crowded, and very nasty <span class="NPIP">places</span> for continuous living.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Do you remember what you saw there, anything in particular stand out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: What, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: No, I can't remember except that on my way out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> I met a gentleman called Mr.Hails who said he was out there to do business.</sentence><sentence id="226">He was in the motorbike business... I think he was going to buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorbikes</span>, and I said that he couldn't really know what as going on in Europe if he thought he could buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorbikes</span> at this particular time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and he said, "Well what are you doing?"</sentence><sentence id="227">and I said, "I really don't know at the moment, but this will be my address, and if you've got time come and visit me."</sentence><sentence id="228">And he visited me the second day I was there and I took him "round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">And in talking to him actually I found out that he was the Mr. Hails who instigated the Atlantic Blue Ribbon for the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>, so he must have been in that kind of business.</sentence><sentence id="230">And going round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, he suddenly disappeared, and I went back to look for him.</sentence><sentence id="231">He was on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> crying his eyes out.</sentence><sentence id="232">He was not knowing what he was going to be in for; he hadn't really expected that I would take him into that kind of situation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: So, would you say that most people weren't aware that these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> existed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: I shouldn't think in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that anybody was aware of it all.</sentence><sentence id="245">I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="246">I should think a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> must have known about it, yes, but whether it was known in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="247">I mean, we were... obviously everybody knew that the Germans marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">Everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> said, you know, "This is Hitler's last ambition, and he's not going to do any more."</sentence><sentence id="249">When I was over there and found out that in marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> not only meant that they were marching into that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which was chiefly inhabited by Germans, but all their defenses were in that <span class="DLF">line</span> too, so from that moment on <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was pretty defenseless in any case.</sentence><sentence id="250">And of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> was full of Germans already.</sentence><sentence id="251">We were followed "round the whole time by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="252">So one could see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="253">I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said, "Look, this is happening," they either didn't want to or didn't believe that what we were actually seeing there meant what we were perfectly certain that it meant: that the Germans were on their way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Where were you staying?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Sroubek</span> which we stayed at when we were over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> four or five years ago, when we were... I got the Freedom of Prague and met Havel and had lunch with Dubcek.</sentence><sentence id="267">It was all very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="268">We stayed at the same <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that I had been at in 1939, right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central Prague</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: And was Martin Blake staying with you there as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: No, he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="275">I think he was already dead --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: No, at the time.</sentence><sentence id="279">In "38.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: He was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sroubek</span>, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Now, will you describe to me how you became aware that you were going to be working on this issue of refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and how you came to that decision?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Well, as I said I went round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I was told of the people whom the British Committee were trying to get out.</sentence><sentence id="293">And every day I met up with Doreen Warriner to discuss what was going on and we usually met at one of the big <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Alcron</span>, and discussed what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="294">Usually there were one or two men sitting not far away, and she had to say to me in German, "Until that gentleman disappears we better discuss the weather."</sentence><sentence id="295">You could be as rude as you'd like to the Germans as English people at that time, because we certainly didn't, and I mean, they certainly, I don't think, at that time ever thought they were going to be at war with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">And we of course hoped they wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="297">And in conversation she said, "There are all these children, you know, who should be got out, but the British Committee just can't do anything about it at all.</sentence><sentence id="298">They're far too overworked with the business of trying to get out the political refugees, the writers and all those people endangered," and said to me, "Look, if anything can be done, perhaps you'd like to try and do it," and that's really how it started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Were you aware at that point that <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had made the decision to let in a certain number of children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: No, I hadn't got a clue.</sentence><sentence id="309">I found a gentleman who came out from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, Trevor Chadwick, who said that if it was possible to bring children out, he'd given up his job as teaching in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swannage</span> (ph), he'd run the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">And I said, "Well, I've not got a clue whether you can bring children into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, but stay there, and I'll go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and find out if anything can be done."</sentence><sentence id="311">And so, I mean, when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> nobody had any idea that anything would really transpire.</sentence><sentence id="312">In the end it didn't prove very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="313">The <span class="BUILDING">Home Office</span> said, "Under certain conditions," which they laid down, "you can bring in as many children as you like."</sentence><sentence id="314">So, the <span class="BUILDING">Home Office</span> made no difficulties at all.</sentence><sentence id="315">Getting children into other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> was more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="316">We got a few children into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> whilst I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, but later on I don't know if that movement continued.</sentence><sentence id="317">But we didn't bring out children to anywhere else except into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">We tried to get children into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> but that wasn't possible at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: How did you try to do that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Well I have letters with a lot of the important people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time and they all gave excuses -- no it's not fair to say excuses -- they gave reasons why they couldn't allow children to be brought into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time, which makes pretty sad reading when you read these letters at the present day.</sentence><sentence id="333">But still, that was... I mean bringing over 600 children was something I suppose, but many more could have been brought over had we... had we had more time as well, of course.</sentence><sentence id="334">I don't think a lot of people realized the urgency which we felt was there.</sentence><sentence id="335">Having been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, one could almost feel that it was any time the Germans could march in.</sentence><sentence id="336">Back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, of course, that urgency wasn't there at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: And you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for three weeks?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> about a fortnight.</sentence><sentence id="351">That was as long as my holiday allowed, and even then I was getting letters: Why did I want to spend time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when I should come back and make money for my firm on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span>?</sentence><sentence id="352">There was no-- certainly not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city--</span> there was no real feeling of either urgency or things should be done, you know.</sentence><sentence id="353">It was rather the, generally the Chamberlain attitude, you know: putting oneself out for a little <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> far away with which we had no genuine obligations.</sentence><sentence id="354">The major factor of Hitler versus Europe wasn't really in people's minds at that time, despite what Hitler had done up to then.</sentence><sentence id="355">And I think there were lots of people who would have obviously far preferred to maneuver Hitler to fight against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> first than for us to take up the cudgels.</sentence><sentence id="356">After all, there had been plenty of time for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the West to take up against Hitler, but before then there was plenty of occasions, as he had been nibbling away at various parts of Europe, that we could say, "Enough, and no further."</sentence><sentence id="357">I mean, by the time we took a stand on the Polish issue most of Europe had been already absorbed, or a lot of it anyway.</sentence><sentence id="358">So, I suppose historians will be writing about that for a long time: whether or not it could have been done differently.</sentence><sentence id="359">I don't think that people, certainly in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, realized the danger.</sentence><sentence id="360">They always thought they could negotiate with Hitler, that in a way he was a smaller menace than what was happening elsewhere in the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: What was the date... do you remember the first... How did you get the first transport out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: Well, I was only then, when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I was working on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span>, which luckily was a job which finished at 3:30 in the afternoon so I could go back and carry on trying to... to make arrangements for bringing children over.</sentence><sentence id="375">And as I say, the British Committee for Refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> didn't give me... weren't able to give me either <span class="INT_SPACE">office space</span> or any help whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="376">And I just had note paper printed with their name on it, and put under, "Children's Section," worked from my <span class="BUILDING">private home</span> up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">And the Reverend Rosalind Lee whom I mentioned, sent me the first 100 pounds to pay for correspondence and everything and we got newspapers like Picture Post to write articles saying that we were looking for guarantors and that we were looking for <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where these children would be looked after until the end of war.</sentence><sentence id="378">And this started to trickle in, and, as we got people who would take children, so we sent them lists of children and even photos of children, and got them to choose children, and we then sent these out to Trevor Chadwick in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, who then arranged for the transport and the getting the children together, whilst we arranged for the people who were receiving the children to arrive at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> to receive them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: Can we go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for just a little while and will you tell me about how you started the operation going, you came to the realization that the children needed help and then what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, the end of 1938 and the beginning of 1939 what did you do after you realized that the children needed help in escaping Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: Once I told Doreen Warriner that if it were possible to do it I would try and do it and knowing that when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I would have to go back to work, the thing was to arrange the set up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> which could go into operation should I be successful when I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="396">The person who was in charge -- I put in charge then was Trevor Chadwick but there was a Mr. Barozetti who was secretary to Doreen Warriner and he kind of ran the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in which Trevor Chadwick had <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="397">The first job of course was as I said there were five committees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> at that time, was to get one central list.</sentence><sentence id="398">I mean you can't work from five lists and try to pick out who are the most important people or the most urgent cases.</sentence><sentence id="399">They were very diffident of course to give up their lists and having such a very short time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> I had to use kind of black mail tactics bringing up eventually I think it was the communist committee saying that I had one list on which I would work and the others could join if they wanted to, otherwise none of the lists would be considered.</sentence><sentence id="400">So within a couple of days we got a joint list and we discussed at that time how the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> would have to work if I could be successful in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">So, it was all a bit hairy fairy and nebulous and it may happen and it may not.</sentence><sentence id="402">But there was an awful lot to be done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> if it did come off.</sentence><sentence id="403">They'd have to get all these children together.</sentence><sentence id="404">They'd have to get exit permits from the -- well, when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> of course it wasn't the German authority because the Germans only arrived in March, but the time we really got going the Germans were in charge because they arrived in March 1939 and then of course they had to get exit permits from the Germans for these children to leave.</sentence><sentence id="405">They then had to arrive with to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then they had to arrange for escorts to go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="406">They then had to find out from how much the operation would cost and we had to send out money eventually to cover that cost which should have been used black mail tactics and two days before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was due to leave they'd say they want another thousand pounds or something which was a lot of money in those days which once you got all the children moving to a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and once you got all the people who are going to receive the children in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> posted that they had to be at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> at a certain time, it's not an operation that you could cancel.</sentence><sentence id="407">Whatever they'd ask for somehow or another we would have had to produce.</sentence><sentence id="408">But there was a lot of work to be done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and it was done very well.</sentence><sentence id="409">The work we had to do in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was to find to meet the conditions which the <span class="BUILDING">home office</span> had laid down which was having a guarantor 50 pounds for each person which they designated as being money which would be used for the children's eventual repatriation at the end of the war, of course there wasn't a war to start with.</sentence><sentence id="410">Then we slowly got people coming in saying yes they would take a child and that accelerated when a lady came to me who had been working for the British committee and brought me all the names of their correspondence throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so I was able to use that with an appeal for children, which of course always brings results whether it's for</sentence><sentence id="412">handicapped children, lame children, or blind children.</sentence><sentence id="413">For children and animals, the two most easiest things to get sympathy and raise money.</sentence><sentence id="414">So, it went slowly but it did work.</sentence><sentence id="415">We never got obviously as many guarantors as we wanted but we didn't have an awful lot of time to work on them and when we got the guarantee for a reasonable number of people we'd do the paper work and send it out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> then had all the job of arranging the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the escorts and the money and dealing with all the parents and getting the children onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">It was quite an operation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="441">Q: When you're compiling lists of the children, did all five committees end up cooperating?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: Well, as I say, we told each individual committee eventually that we can't work with five lists, and before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> they had agreed to coordinate and make one list and I think there was already one list before I left.</sentence><sentence id="444">So, the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> did work on that one list.</sentence><sentence id="445">Obviously it wasn't only people who were on that list who came out.</sentence><sentence id="446">I mean there were people very likely who weren't on the list who heard of this operation going on and wanted to send their children away.</sentence><sentence id="447">I mean, how can you tell which are really the most urgent.</sentence><sentence id="448">I mean I suppose any Jewish child at that time was the most urgent politically of course, it was more difficult to decide and that one had to rely on the committees to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: Were you present when the decisions were being made and were you involved in the decision making process?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="457">A: I was only concerned with the decision making process in the end product of where the children were going.</sentence><sentence id="458">I mean I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> so I couldn't in any way influence who came.</sentence><sentence id="459">That was decided in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> by Trevor Chadwick and with the aid of other people who were working there.</sentence><sentence id="460">I suppose the records which I've got here that 92 percent of the children were Jewish so that 8 percent were either on Hitler's blacklist or were communists or were writers or were children of that type who were in danger, and I think we've hardly made any of them who ever saw their parents or relatives again.</sentence><sentence id="461">Very few, very, very few.</sentence><sentence id="462">So, I suppose that in itself shows -- I mean whatever Jew that was brought out was the right Jew wasn't it.</sentence><sentence id="463">They were all in danger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: While you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, did you interview any parents, children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: I was usually had people in my <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> whilst I was shaving in the morning and usually followed until I put my head on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="474">But there's very little I can remember about that now, but yes, certainly people the whole time were trying to influence you and leaving crates of pilsner beer behind.</sentence><sentence id="475">Well, you can imagine they tried to use what influence they could.</sentence><sentence id="476">I don't think we really, to be quite honest, took any notice of it.</sentence><sentence id="477">You couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="478">You have to be very tough in charitable work.</sentence><sentence id="479">Feel soft hearted in charitable work it becomes impossible.</sentence><sentence id="480">You really got to treat it as a business and we had these lists and we went by them.</sentence><sentence id="481">It's very likely that some people threw influence from knowing people or in some way or another got on the list ahead of other</sentence><sentence id="483">0 people who were just as deserving, but it was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="484">You can't sort it out like that.</sentence><sentence id="485">The same as in social services today isn't it.</sentence><sentence id="486">Lot's of people get on the lists that shouldn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="503">Q: When you returned to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> you were working as a stockbroker by day and working out of your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="507">Q: Did you feel that you were living two lives?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="509">A: It's only difficult to ask me how I felt 50 odd years ago, but no I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="510">I mean I just left one <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and did the other work.</sentence><sentence id="511">It didn't seem strange to me at the time.</sentence><sentence id="512">I had the police corp on me.</sentence><sentence id="513">I remember asking why I had that enormous correspondence with <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> from a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but I think I was far too busy to entertain those kinds of thoughts at that time.</sentence><sentence id="514">It was two different lives.</sentence><sentence id="515">I mean people mostly on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> or a lot of people on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> I didn't talk to about what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="516">I mean nearly all of them or most of them had completely different political views and opinions to mine so there was really no point in discussing it.</sentence><sentence id="517">They couldn't help in any way.</sentence><sentence id="518">At least some of them whom I was more friendly with very likely gave me some money for the running of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, but I can't really remember those details any more.</sentence><sentence id="519">You see this story didn't exist for 50 years at all until suddenly the whole thing became public.</sentence><sentence id="520">That's why all these children are meeting themselves for the first time and some of them are making new friends.</sentence><sentence id="521">Some of them meeting people they didn't know existed and some of them even finding relatives.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="535">Q: So people just if they knew considered it perhaps a quirk or some particular interest but didn't inquire into it very extensively?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: Well, there was no common denominator where they could.</sentence><sentence id="538">150 children coming over and disbursed all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="539">Nearly all of them not finding their parents any more.</sentence><sentence id="540">Some of them kept in touch with each other but there was no organization or anything which in any way brought them together until five or six years ago when the story about the children broke.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="545">Q: Your colleagues didn't inquire into it either?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: I don't think when I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at 3:30 most of the people knew what I was doing in the evenings.</sentence><sentence id="548">I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="549">There was certainly nobody I knew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who in any way helped me with what I was doing with regard to the children, nobody at all.</sentence><sentence id="550">It was two <span class="NPIP">existences</span>, separate, self contained.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="555">Q: Did your skills as a stockbroker aid you in doing this work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="557">A: Oh, I don't think so, no.</sentence><sentence id="558">No, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="559">No, I can't think anything in stock broking or the arbitrage that I was doing helped in any way, no.</sentence><sentence id="560">I mean, after all, you didn't need</sentence><sentence id="562">1 any special knowledge to bring children out.</sentence><sentence id="563">You needed a lot of effort and work and initiative and dealing with authority and all that, that was general knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="564">It wasn't any particular knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="565">It wasn't like the workings of the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> where you had to know how it worked and what the commissions were and what you had to do and when you had to do it and for whom you had to do it and what the price was and remember the price when you were doing something else.</sentence><sentence id="566">It was nothing like that in dealing with children.</sentence><sentence id="567">No, it was quite different.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="581">Q: What suited you for that <span class="NPIP">job</span>?</sentence><sentence id="582">What suited you for that work with the children.</sentence><sentence id="583">What made you the right person?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="587">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="588">That's for you to say.</sentence><sentence id="589">I have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="590">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="591">I've always -- if you call that charity work which I suppose it was I've always done charity work.</sentence><sentence id="592">I've been retired now for 28 years and I've done charity work for 28 years since then.</sentence><sentence id="593">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="594">It's just work I like doing.</sentence><sentence id="595">You don't need any particular gift.</sentence><sentence id="596">I don't know what urges one on to do it at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="607">Q: Will you describe your relationship with the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> as they knew that you were doing this work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="609">A: Thad no connection with the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because I was brought up as a Christian.</sentence><sentence id="610">I was baptized and I was brought up as a Christian.</sentence><sentence id="611">My parents were Jewish but completely non-religious and I think that we were treated as rather a curiosity.</sentence><sentence id="612">We didn't fit into either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="613">I mean the Jewish people thought we kind of opted out and at that time the Christian community must have thought -- I don't know I'm putting ideas into their minds now, it's rather a curious Christian with a German-Jewish name.</sentence><sentence id="614">So, we really didn't fit into anybody and I suppose it was this kind of schizophrenia which made up a lot of my character at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="621">Q: Was the Jewish community aware that you were working to rescue mostly Jewish children from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="623">A: I suppose they were but I was very much -- it was very much me and one or two people who were doing this.</sentence><sentence id="624">I wasn't assisted -- I mean the British committee for Refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> I know a great number of those were yes, run by the Jewish people but I was quite separate to them, although I used their name until right to the end of the period in I think it was July, August when they said yes, you've been so successful now you better come and join us and they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span>.</sentence><sentence id="625">But until then I got no money from them and no assistance from them.</sentence><sentence id="626">In the various committees throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> for whom most of the guarantees for the children came, I would imagine a lot of those were run by Jewish people, yes.</sentence><sentence id="627">But I was only in touch with them by correspondence so I never really met them in that way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="633">Q: Did the British Refugee Committee give you permission to use their name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="635">A: Oh, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="636">I just used their name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="646">Q: Were there any repercussions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="648">A: There was nothing they could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="649">The only repercussions were as I say after we had been doing that if you like illegally for nearly five months they then said this organization calling themselves the British Committee for Refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> Children's Section is somebody who calls himself Nicky Winton calling himself honorary secretary we declare that they're now part of our organization and we became then a kind of accepted part of the group.</sentence><sentence id="650">Before it had been accepted in that way, in a kind of legal way, it had been accepted by everybody who knew no better.</sentence><sentence id="651">People out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> getting a letter from the British Committee Children's Section had no reason to believe that it wasn't the British Committee as such.</sentence><sentence id="652">So, it worked quite good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="658">Q: When you say we did you have any help writing these letters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="660">A: Thad a lady, a girl, who came to help me who had been working for the Christian council and she came every evening and she did all the typing, who in fact later on married Martin Blake.</sentence><sentence id="661">I don't think we had anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="662">We were really just the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="663">It was really a question of keeping the flow of correspondence going and getting the information in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, getting pictures of the children so that when somebody would take a child we could send them photos and ask them to pick a child, it's unfortunate commercial way of doing it.</sentence><sentence id="664">Perhaps that's where my stock exchange upbringing came in, but it speeded things up at the time and we felt that speed was of the essence.</sentence><sentence id="665">Tape 2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="673">Q: I had just asked Mr. Winton if he would like to say anything else about his relationship with members of the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and what their response was to this work you were doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="675">A: Although most of the children we brought out were Jewish I was only looking for families who looked after children.</sentence><sentence id="676">I wasn't concerned at all whether these children went to Jewish or non-Jewish families and this was largely due to the fact that I think that those people had been out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and those people knew what I was doing, Martin Blake and Doreen Wariner and all that were very conscious of the urgency which one could see out there.</sentence><sentence id="677">There was no question when we were looking for a family to look after the children that a Jew should go to a Jew or a non-Jew should go -- it seemed to us at that time perhaps because I'm non-religious myself I don't know but it seemed to me completely secondary.</sentence><sentence id="678">The chief thing was to save the children.</sentence><sentence id="679">This was a not a view shared by everybody because there was one organization in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> which was called The Barbican Mission and they took quite a number of children.</sentence><sentence id="680">I don't really know how many.</sentence><sentence id="681">I mean not an extraordinary number but quite a few children, and they were in</sentence><sentence id="683">3 existence I found out later, I had no idea at the time merely to convert good Jews into good Christians which even when I heard it didn't really alarm me very much because after all they were saved.</sentence><sentence id="684">And I thought the most important thing was to save the children rather than save the religion.</sentence><sentence id="685">But I did have a deputy in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> once of rabbis who came in and really told me something for the first time something that I didn't know that these children that I was bringing over and sending to the Barbican Mission were being made into Christians and I must stop this.</sentence><sentence id="686">We had quite an animated discussion about it and I think I must have told them in no uncertain terms that I was trying to save the children not trying to save the religion and if anybody would take children, I didn't inquire into those matters and they were very cross at the time saying -- and when I said isn't it better to have a Jew rather than a dead one because we were fairly certain what was going on which very few people were at that time.</sentence><sentence id="687">Anyway, what you asked me what my connection with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was at that time that is one that Iremember.</sentence><sentence id="688">And, it still seems to me a rather unfortunate attitude if it did stop anybody coming over because they couldn't get into a Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="689">It seems to be very unfair to confine that person to oblivion rather than to a Christian life which after all they could change later on.</sentence><sentence id="690">So, that was my one memory of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="691">I wasn't myself really in touch with the Jewish community as such at that time.</sentence><sentence id="692">I mean in any case with a job during the day and this in the evening and on weekends, there wasn't much time at that time for any kind of social life.</sentence><sentence id="693">Anyway, I was absorbed in this.</sentence><sentence id="694">I liked doing it.</sentence><sentence id="695">I always liked doing charity work.</sentence><sentence id="696">No particular to me.</sentence><sentence id="697">My son always says to me that everybody applauds you for doing charity work and you'd be miserable if you didn't.</sentence><sentence id="698">So, that's the other side of the coin.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="725">Q: How did you go about finding people to take these children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="727">A: Well, as I say first of all through certain amount though Eleanor Rathbone and the Quakers and the <span class="BUILDING">Unitarian Church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">Then, as I said, Picture Post took it up and printed a letter of mine.</sentence><sentence id="729">I think there's a copy in that book that you've just taken, every issue that they had and we got -- and then of course by getting hold of the correspondence throughout the country of the British Committee and when they got a letter from the British Committee Children's Section to them it was completely authentic and in a way it was authentic and that gave the story of the plight of the children out there and stated what we were looking for and most of our guarantors came from that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Did you actually meet any of the families that were to take these children?</sentence></p></dialogue>

Bells of Childhood which no doubt you've got a copy of.</sentence><sentence id="738">She's always inviting her Mama down and invites us round to meet her.</sentence><sentence id="739">She must be very old</sentence><sentence id="741">4 now.</sentence><sentence id="742">She's 90.</sentence><sentence id="743">You see, a lot of them -- of the ones we know where the guarantor is still alive, they're very faithful in keeping in touch.</sentence><sentence id="744">Of course, one must admit that a lot of the children weren't happy where they were sent and there was an after care department in fact when the war started that Mother looked after which tried when children had problems to get the problems settled or get new guarantors for them.</sentence><sentence id="745">But I certainly don't assume and one cannot assume that every child we brought over went into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and was well treated and was happy.</sentence><sentence id="746">A lot of them we know were.</sentence><sentence id="747">We certainly know some that were not, who were badly treated and used as servants.</sentence><sentence id="748">But quite frankly at the time I didn't think of it and it really doesn't concern me very greatly now.</sentence><sentence id="749">I mean you're bound to have some who weren't happy and all one can say is that they are still alive whereas most of the other children aren't.</sentence><sentence id="750">One knows that the children were targeted as much as the grownups because the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was due to leave at the beginning of September.</sentence><sentence id="751">It would have been our biggest.</sentence><sentence id="752">250 children, an enormous amount of work.</sentence><sentence id="753">Can you imagine getting 250 children from all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> onto a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and then getting 250 guarantors to organize that they should all be at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> at a certain time to receive the people whom they had taken.</sentence><sentence id="754">Then, of course, war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="755">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was cancelled and as far as we've heard from people who should not know a single one of those children survived.</sentence><sentence id="756">So, as I say, I think when you do charity work as I said before, you've got to be pretty tough and if you were concerned more with the fact of are they going to be happy than have they got somebody who will feed and clothe them, you wouldn't bring over nearly as many.</sentence><sentence id="757">I mean the whole operation would really be different.</sentence><sentence id="758">We tried to and all the people who all these committees I talked to around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they told us that they would not send us any person who would take a child unless they them so to a very great extent they were , but it doesn't mean to say that some don't go wrong and we know that some did go wrong.</sentence><sentence id="759">We're in touch today with about 150 of these children or they're in touch with me.</sentence><sentence id="760">That's out of 650 and of those most of them have done extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="761">But you can't tell whether the others have never heard of me or whether they did so badly or had such a miserable life that they don't want to, so you really can't draw any conclusions from the fact.</sentence><sentence id="762">But a lot of them have done extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="763">A lot of them have made big names for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="764">One of them is in the <span class="BUILDING">House of Lords</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">One of them is a big film producer in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="766">Hugo Moron has made a big name for himself.</sentence><sentence id="767">He's a big man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, and a lot of them have done very well.</sentence><sentence id="768">You can't say whether the majority have because nobody has and I certainly haven't made any effort to get in touch with these people.</sentence><sentence id="769">I mean we know that a whole lot went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and I'm sure in <span class="REGION">South America</span> they've never even heard of me.</sentence><sentence id="770">It was only quite fortuitously that it broke in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and was heard of in certain parts of the world but in a large number of <span class="NPIP">places</span> where certainly a lot of these children went, they have got no idea today how they came or why they came or who organized it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: How many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were there all together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: Six, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="812">Yes, I think there were six.</sentence><sentence id="813">It's in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">book</span> when you read it.</sentence><sentence id="814">I believe there were six.</sentence><sentence id="815">There may have been only five.</sentence><sentence id="816">But they're quite interesting statistics breaking them down into religion and all kinds of statistics which are quite interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: Did you meet any of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> when they arrived?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="832">A: All of them, all of them.</sentence><sentence id="833">Yes, I was at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> when every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> arrived which was near to organized chaos as you'll ever get.</sentence><sentence id="834">And that in the name went well.</sentence><sentence id="835">One always has stories of those that got left behind on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> because there was nobody to pick them up, but they were all looked after eventually.</sentence><sentence id="836">And again, the only trauma that we ever had I'm afraid was with the orthodox Jews.</sentence><sentence id="837">One of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> arrived on a Saturday and they wouldn't sign for the children and they wouldn't carry their baggage and you can imagine what we felt like.</sentence><sentence id="838">You know, when it was something that seemed to us so unimportant, immaterial, insignificant, but you couldn't let a child go until you had some kind of paperwork to say somebody had got them, and there they were taking the child and no we can't sign it's Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="839">So, I led Mother onto them then and she usually dealt with the situation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="848">Q: What did she do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="850">A: I don't know but she got them to sign.</sentence><sentence id="851">I don't think she went as far as getting them to carry the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage</span>, but she certainly got them to sign, but then she was a very formidable lady.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="854">Q: Will you say a little bit more about her involvement?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="856">A: Well, nothing except Father had died and Mother was always interested in what I did and when we did get into and we had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and we started getting people writing in or perhaps even the guarantor would have died and obviously the question came back to the <span class="BUILDING">central office</span> what do we do with the child, that was mother's department then to find another guarantor or to deal with any problems that might have arisen at that time.</sentence><sentence id="857">She carried on when the war started because I was doing other things.</sentence><sentence id="858">But as I say not all of them were as satisfactory as one would have hoped but then one wouldn't have expected it.</sentence><sentence id="859">You couldn't do an operation like that without something not being successful.</sentence><sentence id="860">It's not possible because after all the children were different.</sentence><sentence id="861">Some of the children had no idea why they were there.</sentence><sentence id="862">They thought their parents were following them.</sentence><sentence id="863">Some of them were very upset because their parents had sent them away, doesn't Mommy love me anymore.</sentence><sentence id="864">Some of them were old enough to know why they came, but there was a lot of disparity amongst the children themselves which we hear now, not knowing why they were sent.</sentence><sentence id="865">How awful for Mother to get rid of us.</sentence><sentence id="866">No idea why.</sentence><sentence id="867">How should they know what it was all about.</sentence><sentence id="868">Some of them were very young.</sentence><sentence id="869">So, there is no standard case.</sentence><sentence id="870">Either as to the family they went to nor as to the child's attitude at that time.</sentence><sentence id="871">Some of them adjusted well.</sentence><sentence id="872">Some of them quite frankly never adjusted and never will.</sentence><sentence id="873">But most of the ones, the ones that we met now recently at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lauderdale</span>, most of them have done extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="874">They were all very nice and perfectly composed and ordinary citizens, but then it was a small minority when you think of the kindred meeting that we've just had at Ft.</sentence><sentence id="875"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauderdale</span>, where I had to say a few words.</sentence><sentence id="876">There were a hundred.</sentence><sentence id="877">Now, most of them were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German transports</span> which had nothing to do with me at all of which there were 10,000 and of what I call my</sentence><sentence id="879">6 group that came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> over 600, there were four, so I mean you can't tell.</sentence><sentence id="880">Why were just those four and those odd hundred present.</sentence><sentence id="881">Were they the ones that had just heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="882">Were they the successful ones?</sentence><sentence id="883">You know, it's very difficult if anybody was really writing it up in serious history.</sentence><sentence id="884">After an enormous amount of research really to find out fundamental what had happened because all that is written and what is done are those people who have come forward if you like, perfectly voluntary, they needn't have done and one doesn't know why the other -- all right there were 100 out of 10,000 of the Germans there.</sentence><sentence id="885">Is it a geographical reason?</sentence><sentence id="886">Is it for some other reason?Is it because they had the money because it's jolly expensive to spend three or four days to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ft.</span></sentence><sentence id="887"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauderdale</span> and pay in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we were.</sentence><sentence id="888">So, I would hesitate to draw any standard conclusions really as to the whys and wherefores.</sentence><sentence id="889">All one knows really is that yes, those that we brought out should have been brought out because if they weren't they wouldn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="890">That one knows as the absolute standard and definite fact.</sentence><sentence id="891">The rest isn't fact but the best is well it may not be, you don't know.</sentence><sentence id="892">The ones we've met now I mean like couldn't be a more normal or nice person but is she the minority, the majority, the standard?</sentence><sentence id="893">One doesn't know.</sentence><sentence id="894">I don't know and I suppose anybody ever will know.</sentence><sentence id="895">A lot of people pretend to know.</sentence><sentence id="896">A lot of people write that this is what happened and all this but a lot of it is fantasy, thinking, hoping what they hoped perhaps happened.</sentence><sentence id="897">As I say we are delighted when we meet them and a lot of the people that we meet are absolutely delightful have all done extremely well, but we only meet the minority of the people that we brought out.</sentence><sentence id="898">I mean, a lot of them maybe did, but if anybody wanted to do research and try to find out what had happened to 640 children they've got a heck of a job.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="945">Q: In those days you didn't have much further contact after you met them at the <span class="BUILDING">Station</span>, they'd go off with their --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: None at all.</sentence><sentence id="948">I had that job to do and when that job was done, well anyway, the war started and I was doing other things.</sentence><sentence id="949">Because of my experience politically and because of what I saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and feeling that it was all so inevitable that the politicians could have done other things, I started the war as a consciousness objector and I was in the Red Cross on the continent to start with.</sentence><sentence id="950">Later on I joined the R.A.F.because eventually one gets drawn into these things.</sentence><sentence id="951">As I said, most of them we met are absolutely delightful.</sentence><sentence id="952">One would like to think it's the majority or even all of them are like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: When the war began, it was very clear that you couldn't go on doing this kind of work, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="962">A: Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="963">It was stopped.</sentence><sentence id="964">As I tell you, the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> never came, which would have been the biggest.</sentence><sentence id="965">An enormous amount of work had been done.</sentence><sentence id="966">You can imagine processing 250 children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="967">Finding 250 guarantors and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="968">All the amount of work that was.</sentence><sentence id="969">It was pretty awful, just by a day.</sentence><sentence id="970">If the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had been a day earlier it would have come through.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="987">Q: You were a consciousness objector and then you joined the Red Cross, is that right?</sentence><sentence id="988">And what were you doing with the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="991">A: I went with the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance unit</span> to the continent and came out at the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.038" long="2.378">Dunkirk</span> and then as I said I joined the R.A.F. At the end, you know, it's all inevitable once war really starts whether you think it could have been stopped or not.</sentence><sentence id="992">It's really immaterial finally isn't it.</sentence><sentence id="993">It's there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="997">Q: How long were you with the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="999">A: Eight months I think, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="1000">I can't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1001">It's not long ago, only about 60 years ago, but I can't remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1005">Q: The Royal Air Force, you joined voluntarily?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1007">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1008">Most of the people we're meeting here are with the R.A.F. Some were with the Czech Air Force.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1011">Q: Can you describe briefly what you were doing in the air force?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1013">A: Well, it's not terribly interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1014">I had flown privately so I was a pilot in civil life.</sentence><sentence id="1015">I mean I wasn't a pilot professionally but I did fly as a hobby.</sentence><sentence id="1016">When I joined up though I couldn't become a pilot because of my eyesight so I became an instructor in what was called the Link, which was a machine teaching pilots night flying.</sentence><sentence id="1017">Which was interesting because my knowledge of French I had a lot of French pilots who were expert in low level flying and didn't know where they were when they got into a cloud so the Link was supposed to show them what they did when they got into a cloud and as a thank you they took me low level flying which was pretty hazardous for them.</sentence><sentence id="1018">They had two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> they didn't go over them, they went sideways through them.</sentence><sentence id="1019">It was very exciting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1027">Q: How much did you know during the time that the war was going on about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1029">A: Nothing at all.</sentence><sentence id="1030">There was nothing certain.</sentence><sentence id="1031">I don't think there was anything in the papers about it.</sentence><sentence id="1032">Anyway, one was doing other things then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1037">Q: Did you give much thought during that time to these children that you had just brought over?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1039">A: No, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1040">I mean it was a job that I did and it was a job which was completed as far as I could complete.</sentence><sentence id="1041">There was nothing else to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1042">I was doing other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1043">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, I obviously was told that certain of the children had been in trouble and had to be moved from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, but other people were looking after that.</sentence><sentence id="1044">No, I didn't get very -- I didn't get involved in that in any way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1058">Q: You spent after the Royal Air Force and the war ended, what did you do after you were with the Air Force?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1060">A: Oh, when the war ended I joined the Committee for Refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, thinking it would be having got so many people out from where they should have been it was best to join a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to try to get them back again, and I joined this inter-governmental committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> which was taken over or became part of it's more accurate to say, the International Refugee Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1061">We became employed by the International Refugee Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> which was one of the specialized agencies of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and my job there was really nothing to do with the repatriation of refugees.</sentence><sentence id="1062">I worked with an American called dealing with the sorting out of all the German loot that had been found in the various <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> and everything, false teeth and glasses and bags and fountain pens and everything you could imagine was all crated up and given to us to sort out.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Enormous bags and sacks and quantities of watches and alarm clocks, jewelry and we had experts over from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to sort out the jewelry, to find out the real diamonds and the real emeralds and everything from the rubbish and all the jewelry just as one part of the operation was then sent to the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and I had to go there and supervise the sorting out of this again and eventual smelting it down by into gold ingots which I then took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and sold and the money went to the Jewish Agency because this was just before the Jewish state was founded and it went to a Mr. Kaplan who was the treasurer of the Jewish agency and became the first chancellor of the of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Everything else I took to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where it was auctioned off and again the money sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- well the Jewish Agency.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1070">Q: You were based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1072">A: Yes, I was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1073">I was very little there because I was always either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> or taking the stuff across the Atlantic for sale.</sentence><sentence id="1074">It's a very big story the story of the liquidation of all the German loot and it's really one of the stories which I don't think has ever been told.</sentence><sentence id="1075">Before all this stuff was smelted I had a camera and I took photos of it in the vaults of the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> with one bulb and about 20 minute exposures which came out very well and very good pictures of all the jewelry and false teeth and gold evening bags and anything you can imagine that was taken then.</sentence><sentence id="1076">I remember only one person who really came down into the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> to see what was going on and that was , at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1077">I wrote all this up as a matter of fact and it's a big book and that I presented to the , and I've got a copy of everything that was written there, but of course, I haven't got the pictures any more.</sentence><sentence id="1078">That's an interesting story, very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1079">It tells more than a lot of articles written about the time.</sentence><sentence id="1080">You see a picture of a crate of false teeth.</sentence><sentence id="1081">You see a picture full of spectacles which we had to smelt down to get the gold out of.</sentence><sentence id="1082">Really, it tells more of the story than all kinds of books can tell.</sentence><sentence id="1083">But as I say, when I went to the to give them the original of that book, I thought they'd better have it as well.</sentence><sentence id="1084">I mean so many people have taken up writing stories about the children, but I don't know of any books that have been written</sentence><sentence id="1086">9 about the finding and the liquidation of all the stuff that was taken from the Jews at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1087">You'll have to follow it up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1106">Q: How was it found?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1108">A: Well, it was found by the Army I'm told in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span>, or in <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span>, and of course we got it from the Army, but when we got it the Army had already sorted it through to a certain extent and we didn't get any of the paintings.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Presumably they had found out the owners.</sentence><sentence id="1110">We didn't get things like fur coats and we didn't get anything by carpets.</sentence><sentence id="1111">I don't know what they did with them, but I think to start with they tried to find the owners.</sentence><sentence id="1112">I don't really know, but we got the stuff which obviously needed an enormous amount of work done on it.</sentence><sentence id="1113">It couldn't be handled in any other way and for which it was then absolutely impossible to find the owners.</sentence><sentence id="1114">But it was a nasty feeling for weeks and weeks and weeks dealing with all of that.</sentence><sentence id="1115">It was awful.</sentence><sentence id="1116">I remember going into the and all these things were stored there when we dealt with it and there were crates and crates for example of alarm clocks and you walked into that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the mere fact of creating a certain vibration in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> some of the alarm clocks started ringing all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1117">It was quite eerie and we said at the time having sorted it through, this stuff is absolutely worthless and these are interiors of watches and which is absolutely worthless.</sentence><sentence id="1118">The <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was smelting down because it was gold or silver or something and one of the conditions on which we were working was none of this was allowed to go back to the German economy so when we said look we have all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crates</span> that are absolutely worthless interior of watches and old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">alarm clocks</span> they said well you'll have to crate it up and on your trip take the good stuff for sale in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you'll have to get rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="1119">And we had a ceremony which there is also pictures of that, in the middle of the Atlantic bringing out these crates onto the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Somebody standing there with a big ax and making a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in it and then chucking these crates overboard in mid Atlantic.</sentence><sentence id="1121">It's quite an interesting story, but as I say lots of people are writing about the children and all that but I haven't seen any stories written about all this loot business which to my mind is just as interesting -- it doesn't deal with personalities and people but it deals with a very important story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
