congregation.</sentence><sentence id="5">And that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and the photograph of his <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is reproduced in the books -- in the history books, published by the state where I was born and by the city of Kiel, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the photograph of that particular <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is

whole family tree.</sentence><sentence id="18">I have all of their names and birthdates and places of where they were killed, and all those children but -- seven of those children, survived.</sentence><sentence id="19">Seven children of this large family survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="20">And one of the survivor had been interned in <span

id="359">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, as I explained to you, I remember this tremendous impact to me, of seeing men praying -- which of course I had seen, you know, I saw my father

<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for whatever reasons they decided to do that.</sentence><sentence id="374">And our <span

in my family, what happened is, I believe that early in this ballgame, the persecution of Jews was directed against my family as it was against others, and I will tell you why.</sentence><sentence id="383">For some reason my mother became very concern about their -- the future.</sentence><sentence id="384">For herself and for her children and for her husband.</sentence><sentence id="385">So she

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: And the little bit that I'm told over the years, the story is something like this.</sentence><sentence id="442">My parents, of course, lived in <span

understand.</sentence><sentence id="447">He did not have it.</sentence><sentence id="448">So he asked them when he found out, I'll come back tomorrow when I can bring money.</sentence><sentence

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U-boats</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> were located.</sentence><sentence id="455">That's where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German armament ships</span>

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: -- okay, yeah, okay.</sentence><sentence id="476">I was telling you what I believe, right, was a -- a concentrated effort by the Nazis, you know, to intimidate, to humiliate, to debase, to deprive Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city of Kiel</span>, you know, of -- of a normal living and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="477">And that had started, and that's where it was at.</sentence><sentence id="478">It started early in the ballgame, because our denial of exiting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1935, when we had everything approved by the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="481">Interview with Alfred Lakritz a April 3, 2008 <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> an-and e-e-everything, right, was denied because he was in the -- an

id="483">I don't know of any indecency, you know, that's greater than to deny somebody even their right to religious observance.</sentence><sentence id="484">And that's what that is.</sentence><sentence id="485">Okay, now the next story is a story that is also very personal to me, and it is part of this pattern.</sentence><sentence id="486">I believe that it became part of the

-- these Jews who lived in <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> in these small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlets</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> or whatever it is,

id="489">A: -- y-yeah, that the only marriage that they had was a religious marriage.</sentence><sentence id="490">They were all religious, okay, and the record of their marriages and birth were recorded in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, but not -- they didn't marry civilly in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the requirement is that you marry civilly and religiously, but that the only marriage which is valid and recorded and recognized is the civil marriage.</sentence><sentence id="492">Well, I'm giving credit to the bastards, okay?</sentence><sentence id="493">No, no, I have better words for them, but I am giving</sentence><sentence id="495">this much as a lawyer, right?</sentence><sentence id="496">A little bit of credit that -- th-that they used the law to then follow up and do the following monstrosity.</sentence><sentence id="497">They demanded, I believe, this evidence, the evidence that my -- my father's birth certificate.</sentence><sentence id="498">Now, I don't know that he had any kind of evidence, so they -- he didn't have it, let's assume, okay, because obviously he wasn't civilly registered at his birth.</sentence><sentence id="499">So then they demanded proof that his parents were civilly married and they had not been, apparently.</sentence><sentence id="500">So what they did is this: they demanded of my grandfather that he sign an affidavit, and I have a copy of it.</sentence><sentence id="501">I have the original an -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it.</sentence><sentence id="502">And in that affidavit, okay I cannot describe totally every word, but what I understand from this affidavit that he was forced to sign, he was forced to say that my father was his bastard child.</sentence><sentence id="503">Remember, this was the sixth child of his wife and himself, right?</sentence><sentence id="504">This is a devout, you know, couple.</sentence><sentence id="505">My -- my grandmother didn't even have her -- you know, she followed the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of wearing, you know, a wig.</sentence><sentence id="506">I mean, this is about as gross a monstrosity, you know, other than -- to debase human being, right.</sentence><sentence id="507">And this affidavit that I have a copy of, right, attests to the fact that his son Simche, right, is his bastard child.</sentence><sentence id="508">So now, what they did is they forced a -- a -- a family name change of my father, my mother, myself and my brother.</sentence><sentence id="509">No, not my brother.</sentence><sentence id="510">No, he wasn't born then.</sentence><sentence id="511">This was in 1935.</sentence><sentence id="512">So my pursuit and obsession is, to some degree it is to know who we were,</sentence><sentence id="514">Interview with Alfred Lakritz 8 April 3, 2008 what we were, where we come from, you know, wh-why -- who were we.</sentence><sentence id="515">Who were these people who were killed in this unjustified manner?</sentence><sentence id="516">So I, in 1988 went to the consulate of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and I was received by -- and I explained to them on the telephone -- and I explained to whoever I-I spoke to, and I suppose it was the legal officer on the -- of the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, what I was after.</sentence><sentence id="517">And what I was after in 19 dia -- "88 is the beginning of my pursuit to try to prove what happened to my family, so that I could understand, so that I could know, but also so that I could tell my wife, my children and my grandchildren and so on, whatever future we have in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span>, of what happened to their fore-parents and how wrong this was and how this should never happen again, to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="518">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, I was received with extreme courtesy, both by the legal officer and the vice-consul.</sentence><sentence id="519">Both were extremely nice to me, I -- and I explained to them who -- of course, who I was, an-and what my interest was, you know, and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, they were extremely professionally connected to me.</sentence><sentence id="520">They were connected also intellectually, I mean, they -- you know, and they were young, you know, people, as I was.</sentence><sentence id="521">And so our discussions were very frank.</sentence><sentence id="522">And so they asked me a little bit of my history and I told them, you know, where I come from, where my family comes from, you know, and what happened.</sentence><sentence id="523">And so they se -- I told</sentence><sentence id="525">Interview with Alfred

there.</sentence><sentence id="1543">Okay, I remember that, but I also remember something else that was not so nice.</sentence><sentence id="1544">I remember the other boys -- other boys, they grabbed me and they tied me or something to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and they said that I was the Christ killer and that they wanted to punish me or whatever it is, and -- I told this story also to this French historian and she reported it in her book, and I am sure this happened.</sentence><sentence id="1545">That's why she reported it in her book.</sentence><sentence id="1546">That in this environment of Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, you have this play of attitudes of people.</sentence><sentence id="1547">Here is this family being helped and sheltered, allowed to survive, when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews, and yet they did.</sentence><sentence id="1548">And at the same time, the children of others of the age of six and seven, equal to me, target me as a Christ

this underlines what was happening and the crimes of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> are now descended on me.</sentence><sentence id="1552">And they descend on my father, because what follows, right, is a choice made by French police, and French government and French -- and I have that whole testimony laying around that I will tell, about one of the men who had the power and didn't exercise it to save my father's life, but who confessed to me that if he had known that the chief of police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend Guyaux, right?</sentence><sentence id="1553">Gerard Guyaux, a man of extremely great kindness and character.</sentence><sentence id="1554">This man, at -- one of the</sentence><sentence id="1556">times I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and this time to reward him for what he did for my mother, my father's memory and for us.</sentence><sentence id="1557">I gave him a plaque as I gave to others.</sentence><sentence id="1558">And this man said to me -- admitted something to me, and he says, there's nothing they can do to me any more, I'm too old, but I could have saved your father's life.</sentence><sentence id="1559">And if you blew a bomb right there in front of me, I -- I don't think -- among the many, many shocks that I've had in life, this was one.</sentence><sentence id="1560">And he -- and he explained to me why.</sentence><sentence id="1561">He said to me, when they ordered the arrest of your father, and I participated in the arrest -- cause he was the chief officer of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marmande</span>, and Saint- Pardoux is within the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the sphere -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> -- the jurisdictional surrounding of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marmande</span>, under its jurisdiction.</sentence><sentence id="1562">He said, I could have saved him, but I didn't know that the police, the chief of police, was of the same mind as I, that we didn't want this killing of innocent Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1563">We didn't want to make the choice between refugee Jews and French-born Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1564">But I didn't know that, and he didn't know I could trust him, and I didn't know I could trust him.</sentence><sentence id="1565">And so when your father was ordered to be arrested in March 1942, he was arrested, obviously, with the consent and the cooperation of the city of Kiel, and the police of <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, that they have built in recent years.</sentence><sentence id="1631">But the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marmande</span> is the one that means something.</sentence><sentence id="1632">He became the major of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marmande</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1633">He became the representative from that <span class="REGION">region</span> to the assem -- French assembly.</sentence><sentence id="1634">He was a -- a man of tremendous personality and character, and again, a very religious man, a very French man.</sentence><sentence id="1635">And again, they -- this interplay, you know, of -- of -- of what they feel, what they do, and what they -- and who they are, all right?</sentence><sentence id="1636">It -- it plays into this whole -- you know?</sentence><sentence id="1637">And what follows again is this conflict, between others who are obeying orders, others who are willingly passive, others who are willingly complicit and others who are morally -- a-a-a-a-abhor, and afraid or you know, feel impotent to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1638">And so all of these people, I meet all of them.</sentence><sentence id="1639">So, when I'm in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I'm treated well by the teacher and a -- you know, I'm allowed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I'm just a normal kid.</sentence><sentence id="1640">But the kids in the <span class="DLF">playground</span>, I'm not the normal kid, I'm a Jew, dirty Jew, right?</sentence><sentence id="1641">The

learned the patois, which is the local French.</sentence><sentence id="1654">You learned it in no time at all, you could speak it as well as anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1655">And he says, you used to sit on my lap and I would read you stories, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1656">He says, I was amazed that you could speak French, you know, you could speak the patois, and obviously I understood my parents who spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="1657">And they were learning, you know, French too.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And so, I guess he really liked me, and well, a lot of

children, run by Jewish adult leaders and -- and everything is wonderful and normal and so forth, as far as a child is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="1703">It's play, it's hiking, it's -- it's everything, it's games.</sentence><sentence id="1704">Suddenly there is a day that I can never forget.</sentence><sentence id="1705">I'm brought in with my brother to the <span

terror.</sentence><sentence id="1709">I don't think there is any other word to describe what I felt then.</sentence><sentence id="1710">I saw out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> that other children were leaving with their baggage, whatever th-they ha -- they had and here is me and my brother in this dark <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and this man at this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> telling me that my parents don't want us to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, that they want us to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1711">And I have a brother who is

want us to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but other children are going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to their parents.</sentence><sentence id="1713">I am not going.</sentence><sentence id="1714">That's impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1715">There is no way you can explain my</sentence><sentence id="1717">absolute connect.</sentence><sentence id="1718">This is the first time I'd

okay?</sentence><sentence id="1720">Other children were there to play and to f -- have fun, too.</sentence><sentence id="1721">But that they should go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to their parent, and I -- they want us to stay?</sentence><sentence id="1722">That is a moment of absolute terror.</sentence><sentence id="1723">Total incomprehension.</sentence><sentence id="1724">Th-There is nothing that can describe it, nothing that can describe my feeling at that moment.</sentence><sentence id="1725">I am paralyzed, I am horrified, I am scared, I cannot comprehend.</sentence><sentence id="1726">This is one moment in my life where nothing makes any sense.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And believe me, that has impacted my life forever.</sentence><sentence id="1728">That moment.</sentence><sentence id="1729">That revelation.</sentence><sentence id="1730">And of course I had no understanding what, why, but the total incomprehension.</sentence><sentence id="1731">I mean how could my parents, you understand, make this judgment?</sentence><sentence id="1732">They -- it's impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1733">Anyway, I remember being there, and from that moment, for the next two and a half years, I became the guardian of my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1734">And I became obsessed that he should never be separated from me for a moment, because I was afraid of what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1735">If he was separated they may take him away from me, an-and no way.</sentence><sentence id="1736">So, I succeeded in most terms, but there was a period of time when he was housed someplace and I was housed in another one, but that became an obsession with me, that I would go into freaky periods if they suggested anything that I should be separated from my brother, or my brother should be separated from me.</sentence><sentence id="1737">So these other children went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and a few children stayed.</sentence><sentence id="1740">And we stayed with these, some of the Jewish -- for lack of another term, I mean they were adult supervisor, guardians, whatever you want to call them, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1741">Now, they then proceeded on a plan, and the plan I can only describe is a plan of survival of our people.</sentence><sentence id="1742">They put us through the ritual of every holiday, we had to observe them absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1743">We had to put handkerchiefs on our wrist on Shabbas, we had to observe every

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1819">A: Okay, and I have pictures after the fact, a few.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1821">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1823">A: But in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I have the absolute conviction that these Jews had a sense of impending doom.</sentence><sentence id="1824">That they were teaching us only about Judaism, only about our religion, only about the Promised Land, only about the -- I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="1825">And I have the absolute conviction that these people were trying to preserve our religion and our people in th -- whatever means they had, and that -- in the hope that some of us would survive.</sentence><sentence id="1826">Now, I remember several incidents, but let me tell you one.</sentence><sentence id="1827">And this incident is recalled by another child, not necessarily in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but the same event happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="1828">And of course I don't know him, and I didn't know, but in the French book that was written by this French historian of the Jews, what happened, the Jews in the Lot-et-Garonne of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that she researched, among the many people she interviewed, she interviewed another survivor who told her the very same story.</sentence><sentence id="1829">And I don't know him, he doesn't know me.</sentence><sentence id="1830">But the story basically is this.</sentence><sentence id="1831">I remember that those people change our names.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And so my name was changed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lakritz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaCroix</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1833">LaCroix means the cross.</sentence><sentence id="1834">It's a very French name.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And one day they told me, and the other children too, we're going to have</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1838">these people visiting and they're going to ask you some questions, and when they do, when they ask for your name, make sure, don't forget, give them your new name of LaCroix.</sentence><sentence id="1839">So now | am eight years old, I have a new name and now there are people coming to interrogate us.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And so sure enough these people came.</sentence><sentence id="1841">I remember a woman, very well dressed, and some other man, but I remember the woman, she talked to me.</sentence><sentence id="1842">And I told this story to the French historian, among many stories that I told her -- not many, but anyway -- and she reported that story in her book, right.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1843">And she gives credit to someone else telling her the same story, some guy who now lives in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span>, and who also had the same kind of -- the same people.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1844">Well, these people were Quakers, and this was an organization of Quaker, where they tried to save some of the children from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and to ship them to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I remember that afterwards, you understand, we understood that these people were there to try to save us an-and ship us by -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, but that became too dangerous and we could not leave.</sentence><sentence id="1845">But I also remember that by that time I was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> wetter and boys, other boys were making fun of me and they were trying to get me to stop and -- and the way they hope was they wouldn't allow me to change my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and so every night I had to sleep in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that was full of, to put it in plain vernacular, piss, right.</sentence><sentence id="1846">Smelled like <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1847">A-And that was my punishment, my sort of -- they're trying to teach me not to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1848">Now, I'm sure e-everybody that has any</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1851">education about children understand what I didn't know, is that I was so traumatized, I was so terrorized, I was in such pain, right, that that's how it is.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And obviously no child should be treated this way.</sentence><sentence id="1853">But of course it was not their doing, obviously they were saving us, protecting us, hoping that we could survive and -- and continue our people.</sentence><sentence id="1854">To that extent, they succeeded.</sentence><sentence id="1855">These were heroes.</sentence><sentence id="1856">I owe them everything.</sentence><sentence id="1857">Even though later I gave some of that to the nuns who sheltered me also, Catholic nuns, I give credit and my life wouldn't be what it is or could have been if it wasn't for my parents, and if it wasn't for them and if it wasn't for Christians that [indecipherable] follow my story.</sentence><sentence id="1858">Numerous human beings who behaved at the risk of their lives and their liberties.</sentence><sentence id="1859">And this is no speech, this is a fact.</sentence><sentence id="1860">Anyway, from the <span class="BUILDING">Creuse</span>, from that -- we went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and when I saw a few years ago a movie called, "The Children of Chabanne", | said, I remember that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1861">I was there.</sentence><sentence id="1862">I was one of the children that was sheltered in that chateau of the French journalist and these two, also all Christian teachers who sheltered Jewish children, orphan children, who had to fight off, you know, th-the -- the

events that I remember very specifically.</sentence><sentence id="2103">The one thing I expressed earlier, and I say it again because it helps to explain; I had an obsession and fear, absolute fear, that I would be separated from my brother and he from me.</sentence><sentence id="2104">I mean, this was an absolute fear.</sentence><sentence id="2105">And obviously that fear is clearly tempered and explained by the fact that we were suddenly separated from our parents, right, without any comprehension or explanation by anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2106">So now what happens in this episode to my brother and I for two and a half years is that we are in the company of other Jewish children, so they are contemporaries.</sentence><sentence id="2107">Some are older, right, many years older, cause we're very little, and some of them are about our age, and we play and -- and -- and do things like little children.</sentence><sentence id="2108">One of the frightful memories that I remember is my wife and I went for two weeks to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in -- in the south -- I mean in the west -- I mean the east part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> call -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anisy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2109">We</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2112">went there to attend a <span

class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2117">Now anyway, so one of those weekends we went someplace else, and this very nice woman w -- we had to find <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span>, we had no reservation, so she offered us a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in -- in her big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, whatever it was, a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2118">And some story about that her son -- I was looking to locate this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and that her son might know something, you understand, that he was cognizant of the history and th -- and th-the -- during the wartime and the resistance that occurred there and the -- the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2119">And so we went to her <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and she showed us the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="2120">Anyway, so we didn't want to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="2121">But as we walked out, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">queue</span> -- a <span class="DLF">line</span> of little children going to dinner, I guess, or coming from dinner, I don't remember exactly, my wife will remember.</sentence><sentence id="2122">And I was absolutely thrown back to that time when this reminded me about me, about me and the other children, that this is how we were, we went on <span class="DLF">line</span>, everything, everything</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2125">we did was in part of the others and that we had little

were.</sentence><sentence id="2127">And I -- it was one of those moments where you're taken back to this memory.</sentence><sentence id="2128">Anyway, these were times where we had the company of other children.</sentence><sentence id="2129">Other children who were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> as we were, and we knew we were in danger.</sentence><sentence id="2130">We knew

continuous practice of law in the state of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of the experience of the war is I haven't gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and

id="4322">Not depend on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4323">We -- she did it.</sentence><sentence id="4324">Now sure, we had a little bit of help from my inheritance, we had a little help that was given to her in-in -- in some reparation, you know, by the German government.</sentence><sentence id="4325">Some by a pension of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, right, cause they were ab- absolutely guilty of complicity, you know, to the murder of my father.</sentence><sentence id="4326">I mean, that's absolute.</sentence><sentence id="4327">I condemn them as total accomplices, okay.</sentence><sentence id="4328">The fact that my father's name is on the memorial of the dead in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, right, the only Jew that is so honored, you know, i-is -- is a -- is -- is a proof of the fact that some French people recognized the enormity of their complicity.</sentence><sentence id="4329">But to some degree, we have to understand, you know, they had limited choices.</sentence><sentence id="4330">They could only act at the peril of</sentence><sentence id="4332">Interview with Alfred Lakritz ss April 3, 2008 their own life, and they had to depend on everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="4333">So, you know, in this whole ballgame, right, who are the only real, real monster?</sentence><sentence id="4334">Of course, it's the German.</sentence><sentence id="4335">This educated, right, most advanced culture of all became induced and seduced by these -- these -- these monsters.</sentence><sentence id="4336">So they're all accomplices, they're all murderers.</sentence><sentence id="4337">Under the laws the way we have it in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, if you are an accomplice before the fact or after the fact to a murder, you are guilty of murder.</sentence><sentence id="4338">They are guilty of murder, period.</sentence><sentence id="4339">All of them.</sentence><sentence id="4340">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="4341">Now, again, the -- the -- the importance of my statement here is that there is balance.</sentence><sentence id="4342">And those who survived, some of them have survived that they can see, still see the evil and the dark of what happened, and yet live a beautiful life, without forgiving, without forgetting.</sentence><sentence id="4343">I will never forget the murderers of my father.</sentence><sentence id="4344">Never forget the pain and suffering they inflicted on my mother.</sentence><sentence id="4345">And it would be a dishonor to me or anybody who lived through what I lived through, not to honor their mother and father, or their relatives, right, for their horrible, horrible death, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4346">And that is the legacy.</sentence><sentence id="4347">And I ask myself, why was I allowed to live?</sentence><sentence id="4348">You know, why was I spared?</sentence><sentence id="4349">Well, I believe this is one of the reasons.</sentence><sentence id="4350">This collection of work, my testimony here, right.</sentence><sentence id="4351">I didn't give it earlier because I didn't have all the documents that I wanted, right.</sentence><sentence id="4352">Now I have it.</sentence><sentence id="4353">Now I give it, and I give my judgments, too.</sentence><sentence id="4354">I answer your inquiry, but I'm willing to give it to you in a sense of saying I condemn what should be condemned.</sentence><sentence id="4357">154 Interview with Alfred Lakritz April 3, 2008 Okay, there is one other point that I need to make.</sentence><sentence id="4358">The United States of America, to its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the Jews of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="4359">And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the past but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others.</sentence><sentence id="4360">And that is a credit, because in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, after they recognized what they had done wrong or been complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4361">They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or deg48, to be more correct, and now, to stand and protect <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, provide them arms and money and -- and support, politi -- many, many, many time the lone <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the lone voice.</sentence><sentence id="4362">Many, many time <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, right, who should have supported, right, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they voted the other way or they remained silent.</sentence><sentence id="4363">The United States of America, to its great credit, also grew up and learned.</sentence><sentence id="4364">And the fact that we today even consider that a black could be president of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or a woman become president of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> finally, I think in great part is the lessons that were learned by the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4365">So the generosity of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and it is a generous <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I think in part, is a debt of repayment to what they didn't do to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4366">But that doesn't diminish my love for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
