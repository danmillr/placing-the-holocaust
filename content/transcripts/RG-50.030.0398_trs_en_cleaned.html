<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="38">I was born into a family of two sisters and four brothers.</sentence><sentence id="39">Two of the brothers and one sister were half-brothers.</sentence><sentence id="40">They were children of a first husband of my mother's.</sentence><sentence id="41">My parents were originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, as was my mother's first husband.</sentence><sentence id="42">In fact, I still possess her Ketuba from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, and her permit to travel in the pale (ph) of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and she came as immigrant as many people did at the time of the turn of the century when everybody seemed to be leaving for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and she was one of those immigrants that got stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">As you probably know, almost all of them -- particularly the Jews -- intended to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were supposed to be lined with gold, but my mother got left behind, and eventually met my father who married her, and I grew up in this large family as the youngest child, and it was rather nice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: What was your mother's name and your dad's name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: My mother's name was Kravitz, which is, I think, is a common name.</sentence><sentence id="54">She was married -- her first marriage was to a cousin.</sentence><sentence id="55">She was an orphan, according to what she told me -- I'm sure she spoke the truth -- and was married to a cousin, and the grandfather -- her grandfather who brought her up -- felt it was important for her, also, to leave.</sentence><sentence id="56">I think she loved <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and would've liked to have stayed.</sentence><sentence id="57">You know, this story that people tell of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">pogroms</span> are not always true.</sentence><sentence id="58">A lot of them left for economic reasons, just as everybody else left Europe for economic reasons.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: And your dad?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: My father came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, I think from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>, he told me.</sentence><sentence id="68">Some of his family went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbin</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>, and eventually ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and they live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">One of their sons has gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">My mother's relatives came to -- I don't know if it's the midwest -- they came to <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, and I know that as a child, they used to write me and send me dollars for candy, but I never met them, and I think, as happened in other families, correspondence was sparse and eventually contact was lost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: And What was your father's name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: My father was Nathan Zahl, Z-a-h-l. He had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who were on the stage, and they were in <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, and they were nice family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: So, what was it like growing up in this family with all these children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Well, they weren't children to me.</sentence><sentence id="82">They were all adults.</sentence><sentence id="83">I was a child growing up ina family of adults, and since ostensibly I was a weak child, I was always being sent away to recuperate.</sentence><sentence id="84">So, I didn't grow up close to this family, close emotionally to this family.</sentence><sentence id="85">I did to my eldest sister, who is really a half-sister, but I was very much, I think, a lone child because everybody else was older than I. The next one in the family was five years older than I.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: And are there any particular characteristics of this family?</sentence><sentence id="92">Were you religious in the family?</sentence><sentence id="93">Not religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: We were not religious.</sentence><sentence id="98">My father was, I would say, a-religious.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="99">[Technical difficulty; asked to start over preceding <span class="NPIP">part</span>]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Oh, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="101">From where?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: Well, tell me about your family and in terms of are you a religious family?</sentence><sentence id="105">Were you not a religious family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: We were not a religious family in the sense we didn't attend <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">My father did take me to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on all the holidays.</sentence><sentence id="110">He explained to me what was going on, but he was not a religious man.</sentence><sentence id="111">The nice thing I remember about being Jewish, I suppose, was the wonderful Friday evenings when we all gathered together, and on the holidays when friends would also come, and for the Passover when they would invite people who didn't have family.</sentence><sentence id="112">My mother was a very generous, warm, and kind person, and she was always inviting people into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">She was very forward-looking, I think.</sentence><sentence id="114">I hope, that I have some of her characteristics.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: What kind of political consciousness was there?</sentence><sentence id="123">You grew up at a time when there was a lot of upheaval in <span class="REGION">western Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">Were you very conscious of it as you grew up in the late "20s, in the early "30s in terms of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: In the late "20s, I would say no.</sentence><sentence id="129">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, we had, as you had, a tremendous depression, economic depression.</sentence><sentence id="130">There was a lot of employment even -- not even, but in my family, too.</sentence><sentence id="131">I began to be aware that things were happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when I was 14 or 15, a <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span>, of which I was member, began to have youngsters from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> come to learn English, to help pass the time.</sentence><sentence id="132">They were builted (ph) locally, and I got to know some of them and felt awful that they had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, let's say in deg35-"36, without their parents -- to a <span class="REGION">foreign country</span> where most of them had no relatives, and I felt very deeply about this.</sentence><sentence id="133">I think this is what affected me when eventually the British asked for volunteers to go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">I felt it was important that I must go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Could you please explain what a <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> is?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: A <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> -- we had them also in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- A <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> is a <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> run usually by a voluntary agency, where youngsters and older people come.</sentence><sentence id="145">They have classes, educational classes, classes for mothers, in the old days, I suppose, they had classes teaching people English.</sentence><sentence id="146">It's a real <span class="BUILDING">community center</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: So, tell me what these kids told you.</sentence><sentence id="151">I mean, I know you were conscious that they were orphans -- not orphans, but they were without their parents, without their family.</sentence><sentence id="152">Did they tell you about what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: No, they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="157">They just -- they didn't talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="158">One didn't ask.</sentence><sentence id="159">Firstly, being British, you're rather reticent, anyway, but one had a sense that these kids were alone, terribly alone.</sentence><sentence id="160">There was no family.</sentence><sentence id="161">There were no cousins.</sentence><sentence id="162">Occasionally, one would have an aunt in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and that would be rather nice because she had family to relate to, but in the 30s, many German parents -- rather, not many, but a number of German parents who could afford it were sending their children to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because German law prohibited them from attending <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">Very early on in, I think, 1933, the first law came in which limited the number of Jewish children who could attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">And so, a number of them came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and they were taken in by families.</sentence><sentence id="165">There was an organization called B'nai B'rith, which still exists, and they helped a lot of these children, particularly the Orthodox Jewish children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: So, at what point do you think -- was it after the war, or in 1939 that you became very conscious of what was happening?</sentence><sentence id="177">What drew you in 1943 to join the relief effort?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well, firstly the war came in "39.</sentence><sentence id="181">I remember we had the bombing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and 90 days of bombing constantly is not very pleasant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: What was that like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: That was pretty awful.</sentence><sentence id="187">Very often, I would be scared and I'd sit under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, or I would like people to think that I was brave and so I took tea to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> wearing my tin hat until I was going out one day with a young friend, and a piece of shrapnel went through his tin hat, and he was no longer.</sentence><sentence id="188">It was frightening and yet, you didn't like to appear a coward.</sentence><sentence id="189">We did things that we would never do.</sentence><sentence id="190">We went into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and put out incendiary bombs because, since the government, I suppose, wanted to know how many incendiaries had been dropped, they would pay us a half a crown which was about half a dollar in those days, to bring in the ends of incendiary bombs.</sentence><sentence id="191">So, we'd go out and we'd pick these things up once the bomb had gone off.</sentence><sentence id="192">And, yet, we used to sit on the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> occasionally in an air raid, and say, "What will we tell our children of the war?"</sentence><sentence id="193">And, you know, we were eating peanuts and we'd say, "Well, we'll tell them that we sat on the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> eating peanuts."</sentence><sentence id="194">But, it was an interesting period because we never saw a fruit.</sentence><sentence id="195">If anybody brought in an orange, if an American soldier gave somebody an orange or a banana, we raffled it to the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="196">We didn't go hungry.</sentence><sentence id="197">We were never short of the most awful bread you can ever imagine, and the American powdered egg, which we even thought made good cakes, you know, we had forgotten what a good cake tasted like.</sentence><sentence id="198">But, as I say, we were never hungry, and interestingly, we always knew we were going to win the war.</sentence><sentence id="199">Don't ask me why, perhaps this was a moral booster, perhaps this was Churchill's speeches, but we never thought the Germans would overrun us.</sentence><sentence id="200">Of course, we always suspected that we would be invaded, and this influenced, of course, the British attitude toward the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="201">We suspected everybody with a German accent of being a spy.</sentence><sentence id="202">It was a very difficult period for them, much more so than for us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: So, then, 90 days of bombing straight?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Ninety days of bombing on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: Was your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ever hit?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: It was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Yeah, but my mother was okay, you know, the heck with the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: So, where did you go?</sentence><sentence id="231">Did you stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: I met recently a woman, she called me as a result of my book.</sentence><sentence id="235">She called me and she said, "Do you remember, after the air raids when you'd done all your rounds, you used to come into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and sleep on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mat</span> or anywhere?"</sentence><sentence id="236">No, I went to stay with friends, and after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was hit, we got my mother to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and go into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">I wouldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="238">I felt safest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, believe it or not.</sentence><sentence id="239">I couldn't bear the thought of being outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and seeing the bombs falling, because you could see the fires.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: And your mother was okay with your staying?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: My mother was okay.</sentence><sentence id="249">We were all okay.</sentence><sentence id="250">It's very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="251">There was no counseling in those days, and I sometimes wonder if we have too much counseling when a child goes through a small trauma, true, a trauma, but in the old days going through this bombing, nobody came and counseled us and very often we were helping to dig bodies out of the <span class="BUILDING">Anderson shelters</span> and finding people who were wounded badly, but we carried on.</sentence><sentence id="252">You know, this was life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: So, you were then how old, 13?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: I was -- no, I was older in 1939, I was 18, and in 1940, I was 19, but we had no prior experience of this.</sentence><sentence id="261">The most wonderful thing to happen to us was when Hitler invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because then the bombing began to let up.</sentence><sentence id="262">And it was extraordinary because we all felt so guilty that here the Russians were taking what we had been having, and in those days, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was our friend.</sentence><sentence id="263">The Cold War that came later seemed so -- so different, so difficult a period when we think of, we knew what the Russians were going through, that millions were being killed by the Germans, millions and millions of them.</sentence><sentence id="264">I don't think people even today realize how many millions of people were killed during that war outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">I mean, we talk of six million Jews dying, and that number, you can't imagine what six million is, and it was dreadful.</sentence><sentence id="266">There isn't a Jewish family, I think, worldwide, which didn't lose a relative, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, about 25 million people died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: After 1941, when <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was attacked, did you learn what was going on in terms of the killing of Jews and did you know what had gone on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the "30s, rounding up political opponents and Jehovah's Witnesses?</sentence><sentence id="275">Was there much knowledge that you had at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: If we read The Press and The Times published a lot of material.</sentence><sentence id="279">We knew.</sentence><sentence id="280">I'm not saying I was very well-versed in what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="281">I knew Jews were being killed.</sentence><sentence id="282">I knew they were being put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> because sometimes a friend would have a cousin who was 15, who'd been brought out whose head was shaven, and he'd been incarcerated in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">We knew that people were being killed.</sentence><sentence id="284">We knew that the Nazis were very nasty people, but when the killing really started, when the Final Solution started in 1942, I don't think we, as individuals, I don't remember, but I don't think I knew this.</sentence><sentence id="285">We didn't trust the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="286">We knew they'd kill every Jew they could get their fingers on.</sentence><sentence id="287">So, from that point of view, we knew we had to be very careful.</sentence><sentence id="288">For example, if you would walk along the <span class="DLF">country lane</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, or even an ordinary <span class="DLF">street</span>, and ask somebody directions, they'd never tell you in case you were a spy.</sentence><sentence id="289">The sign posts were taken down.</sentence><sentence id="290">So, unless you knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> in which you were visiting, there was nothing you could do.</sentence><sentence id="291">We were terribly afraid of being invaded.</sentence><sentence id="292">Ostens- you know, not ostensibly, obviously because we were 21 miles from the <span class="REGION">French coast</span>, not very far, and not too far across the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> to get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and attempts were made to bring spies in.</sentence><sentence id="293">So, it was a very difficult period because, if you met somebody you didn't know, you didn't discuss anything that might in some way give them information.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Did you feel it was important when the Americans joined in the war effort?</sentence><sentence id="311">Was that a good sign for you, or did you actually feel before then, "We'll win anyway.""?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: I think before the Americans came, we thought we'd win, but when the Americans came, Hallelujah!</sentence><sentence id="315">Now, it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="316">It was wonderful because now we had an ally.</sentence><sentence id="317">Can you imagine, in 1940, we were alone, totally alone, and many of us were making plans to try to escape somewhere because we knew that, as Jews, we, too, would be taken by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="318">But when the Americans, with the vast machinery for production, came into the war, somehow we really knew we might win.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Did you also make plans to leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>

describe that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Not all of us.</sentence><sentence id="416">The two of age groups met individually, and we had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">training camps</span> at one of the <span class="DLF">Rothschild estates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">I was a cook in one of them.</sentence><sentence id="418">So, the people would not only eat decently, but be able to attend the various sessions.</sentence><sentence id="419">There was some very good people who came and talked about what we might find, but who would know what we would find?</sentence><sentence id="420">Nobody had any experience.</sentence><sentence id="421">What happened in these training sessions is that we got to know each other, and we were all as different as chalk from cheese.</sentence><sentence id="422">Many of us didn't know each other, and it was a way of getting to know each other, getting to know the people who were doing the training.</sentence><sentence id="423">We were absolutely green when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, and as we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>, there were men on horseback along the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> shooting at us, just for fun.</sentence><sentence id="424">And, we were under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="425">You know, and when I think of it, I don't think we were really scared.</sentence><sentence id="426">Who expected to be shot at?</sentence><sentence id="427">You know, you're coming to do relief work.</sentence><sentence id="428">We were in a <span

to read army records of what was happening, and that's when we really got to know what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">The British were brining in Yugoslavs from the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="431">There was one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that held about 20,000 people, and there was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which we -- we, the new units -- were sent up to take care of on the <span class="DLF">Suez Canal</span>, a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Khataba</span>, K-h-a-t-a-b-a, and when these people came in, they were emaciated.</sentence><sentence id="432">They had women who were breastfeeding children of four and two.</sentence><sentence id="433">Their breasts were like envelopes.</sentence><sentence id="434">They had suffered tremendous malnutrition.</sentence><sentence id="435">The British had taken them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span> to <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span>, which was liberated, and then brought them into <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, but I must say the food that was provided for them was excellent.</sentence><sentence id="436">The sun didn't hurt.</sentence><sentence id="437">They lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="438">There were very few men.</sentence><sentence id="439">They were mostly women and children, boys of 14 who had been in the army, who had lost limbs.</sentence><sentence id="440">And gradually they recovered.</sentence><sentence id="441">And my job at that time was to set up <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">Well, how do you set up <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for children when you have -- there were two trained teachers, in fact, but no books, no pencils.</sentence><sentence id="443">We had learned some Yugoslav, and some of us were better at it than others.</sentence><sentence id="444">The army was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="445">You could always get around the quartermaster.</sentence><sentence id="446">And I discovered that there were little white stones in the sand in the <span class="DLF">desert</span> on which we were.</sentence><sentence id="447">So, we gathered the stones, and this how we taught them to write.</sentence><sentence id="448">We had -- we were given a couple of <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>, and then the ladies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>, as there are always ladies who want to do good, came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with shoes, and most of these children hadn't worn shoes in their life, and they were afraid of these things.</sentence><sentence id="449">But we say to them, "Look, these ladies really are very kind.</sentence><sentence id="450">They're also bringing clothing.</sentence><sentence id="451">While they are here, please wear the shoes.</sentence><sentence id="452">When they're gone, you can take them off."</sentence><sentence id="453">It was rather nice.</sentence><sentence id="454">I remember that instant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: How did you use the stones for writing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: Oh, you formed letters with them.</sentence><sentence id="498">Later on, we were able to get some paper, and the ladies from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> actually were very good.</sentence><sentence id="499">When we told them what we needed, they began to send paper and pencils in, and what we did, we sent some people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over to the larger camp of refugees, where they were trained to be teachers.</sentence><sentence id="500">They were trained in one month to be schoolteachers and came back.</sentence><sentence id="501">They did a remarkable job.</sentence><sentence id="502">There was a war on, and everything was possible during the war.</sentence><sentence id="503">I think also because most -- well, I think almost all of us in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> had suffered the bombing and suffered the war.</sentence><sentence id="504">We could compromise, we could change things around, we learned very quickly to put up <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>, we were sleeping four of us in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">I remember the dreadful latrines, which were seemed to me a mile long, and with hession, a sort of canvas in between, and you lived like this.</sentence><sentence id="506">We ate fairly well.</sentence><sentence id="507">I was never sick.</sentence><sentence id="508">Some people got dysentery.</sentence><sentence id="509">I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="510">Everything we ate on our own, which we weren't sure of, we put potassium tablets in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> to disinfect any nasty creatures, and we lived that way until October of 44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="525">Q: I know you're going to move the next <span class="NPIP">site</span>, but let me ask you, when you saw these folks from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, what was your first impression?</sentence><sentence id="526">Were they telling the stories of what had happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: They didn't have to tell stories.</sentence><sentence id="530">You looked at them.</sentence><sentence id="531">You looked at the babies with big stomachs and big heads, and some women were breastfeeding children of two and children of four.</sentence><sentence id="532">She was feeding two babies, because they had had no real food for so long.</sentence><sentence id="533">In our <span class="INT_SPACE">units</span>, by the way, there were many doctors who volunteered, women, and they immediately set up a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but we got a measles epidemic, and in eight weeks, I think, we buried -- no, six weeks, we buried over a hundred children, and that was dreadful because we lived within the hospital compound, and they crying of these women was absolutely dreadful, dreadful.</sentence><sentence id="534">To lose a child, no parent should bury a child.</sentence><sentence id="535">It was awful for them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="543">Q: So, you were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for how long?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="545">A: Ten months.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="549">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: So, did you consider yourself now a seasoned relief worker at the end of the ten months?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: I never even thought of it that way.</sentence><sentence id="554">We had a job to do.</sentence><sentence id="555">We did our job.</sentence><sentence id="556">The Yugoslavs, as they got well, entertained us.</sentence><sentence id="557">They had beautiful singing voices, and they would sing in four, five parts.</sentence><sentence id="558">There were some others who were musicians, and they were very nice people, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="559">They were very clean people.</sentence><sentence id="560">A lot of them, I would say for the most part, were peasant people, but, you know, they were human beings.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: And so then, why did you -- why were you sent away from that situation to another situation?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A: Oh, because <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> was liberated, and the allies were getting ready for the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="573">liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, which we had been trained to enter.</sentence><sentence id="574">Trained in the sense that we learned the language, we knew where we were going, we knew the kinds of jobs we would do, and because of the work we had done in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, we were trained to take care of Yugoslavs who had gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> in this war.</sentence><sentence id="575">When we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, I happened to have been in the first unit of ten people who were sent over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> in preparation for going into <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and Teeter was approached by the British American armies.</sentence><sentence id="576">I'm not quite sure of the chain of command.</sentence><sentence id="577">He said, "We'll do the job ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="578">Send us the goods."</sentence><sentence id="579">And they did.</sentence><sentence id="580">They did a very good job.</sentence><sentence id="581">So, here we were, the rest of the unit had come into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, we were sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="582">The Italians were very pleased to see us.</sentence><sentence id="583">The Italians were very nice actually.</sentence><sentence id="584">They were living under appalling conditions, having suffered German occupation and British occupation, and they would have liked us to have stayed, but we really had no job to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="585">And then we heard one organization working in <span class="REGION">southern Italy</span> called the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</sentence><sentence id="586">They had, I think it was one representative at the time, a man called Reuben Resnick, working there, and we thought it would be an excellent idea if we could be seconded or loaned to this outfit so that we could help them.</sentence><sentence id="587">We had been given by the army, as had all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span>, a three hundred weight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and a three ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="588">We all learned to drive that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dodge</span> which was double the clutch.</sentence><sentence id="589">It was terrifying, but we could all drive them, and we had lots of supplies.</sentence><sentence id="590">And so in talking to the army, and the heads of the units did so, we asked if we could join the American organization and they said, "Certainly, and take all your supplies with you."</sentence><sentence id="591">It was a lot of give and take in those days.</sentence><sentence id="592">They're much more difficult today.</sentence><sentence id="593">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="594">And so we loaned ourselves to the Joint.</sentence><sentence id="595">We went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to start with.</sentence><sentence id="596"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> was still occupied, I remember, because as it was liberated, some of our boys took matzohs up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span> for the first Passover of the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="597">I was helping to get ready the first legal transport going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="598">I think it left on April the 12", if my memory serves me, and I remember Moshe Shertock - I think, yes, that was his name -- went with us, and I and somebody from the Joint, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, or Gaynor Israel Jacobson, worked on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and got that going, and it was very interesting because there were "X" number of certificates.</sentence><sentence id="599">People still had to have certificates from the British government to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and let's assume that we had 300, and they were all numbered.</sentence><sentence id="600">As people got on, the cards of those in front were taken and given to others at the back.</sentence><sentence id="601">So, although 300 were supposed to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, probably there were 400 or 500.</sentence><sentence id="602">I never did know how many got on, and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> went off.</sentence><sentence id="603">That was one of the things we did.</sentence><sentence id="604">We also, which were helping people who would come in from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> in small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="605">I remember, the women would come in with hand grenades around their waists, great big burly women, very nice, but terrifying.</sentence><sentence id="606">And we met a lot of people, and then, of course, the Germans were still trying to bomb us, and I know, I remember very distinctly, when the Germans came over, of course, the Americans -- the American civilians who hadn't seen any of this stuff, any of the bombing, would rush to the <span class="DLF">windows</span>, and we Britishers would rush under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> because we knew what shattered glass could do.</sentence><sentence id="607">It was an interesting time.</sentence><sentence id="608">When -- yes, it was an interesting time, and as <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> began to be liberated, some of our people were going up north.</sentence><sentence id="609">When <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was liberated, I was asked by the European director of the Joint 1 Distribution Committee, a very wonderful man called Dr. Joseph Schwartz.</sentence><sentence id="610">He was a rabbi by training, and really a very, very wonderful human being, one of my heroes.</sentence><sentence id="611">He asked me if, when <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was liberated, I would go into <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> with their director, and of course, who would refuse?</sentence><sentence id="612">And, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> -- well, the war was still on -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated, and people, I think, don't realize that so many thousands of people had been incarcerated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, and the army had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them once they were liberated, and the only thing they thought of doing was sending these people <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="613">So, being in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at the time of the end of the war, suddenly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> began to come in with these young men and women, many of them spitting blood from tuberculosis, no families.</sentence><sentence id="614">Out of a total, I think, of 70,000 Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, there were about a total of 10,000 who survived all together, both in hiding and among those who came back, and I remember some of them having to sleep in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="615">It was summer.</sentence><sentence id="616">It was June when they got back.</sentence><sentence id="617">They had to sleep in the <span class="DLF">street</span> because there were no <span class="BUILDING">sanitarium</span> -- no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sanitarium beds</span> for them, and it was very, very difficult because none of them family.</sentence><sentence id="618">There were girls with no sisters or brothers.</sentence><sentence id="619">There were boys with no family.</sentence><sentence id="620">Occasionally, you'd see an adult who son or daughters had been killed, and this organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, set up a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> with a very wonderful local Greek lady called Mrs. Mossieri.</sentence><sentence id="621">I'm sure her children are still alive.</sentence><sentence id="622">She was a go-getter, and she helped to set up this <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">I went with Israel Jacobson to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time to meet with Golda Meir and Mr.Sheretz Shatok (ph), and I can't think of the other gentleman's name at the moment, to talk to them about supplies that we would need and also people were beginning to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> illegally.</sentence><sentence id="624">It was very easy.</sentence><sentence id="625"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perez</span> was next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="626">They sent in some of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> of workers.</sentence><sentence id="627">There were people, ostensibly press agents.</sentence><sentence id="628">All the marvelous people, and one of the things that we asked at that time was that you slow down the movement because the British would come to what was known as a Hachshara, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perez</span>, and count the individuals there.</sentence><sentence id="629">And I remember the one day they came and they said, "Where is everybody?"</sentence><sentence id="630">And we said, "They've gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="631">That was nice.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: Well, they cooked Yugoslav food, and they cooked very well, and occasionally they would invite us to come and enjoy a meal with them because our food was cooked by the Arab cooks, and it was okay.</sentence><sentence id="927">There was nothing wrong with it, but Yugoslavs are very good cooks.</sentence><sentence id="928">It was heavier food than we were used to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: Who provided them with food?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="988">A: No, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, it was different.</sentence><sentence id="989">Firstly, there were the displaced people.</sentence><sentence id="990">They were Yugoslav Jews.</sentence><sentence id="991">They were Russian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="992">They were all kinds of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="993">They were Italian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="994">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, there was quite a community of Jews who had been in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="995">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, for example, which had been taken over by the Catholics.</sentence><sentence id="996">The Catholics had taken the Jewish children from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and had hidden them in their <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and then they'd hidden them again, and when the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic orphanage</span> was bombed, the one that was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the American Joint Distribution Committee rebuilt it for them as a thank you for having saved the Jewish children, and then our units -- because we had volunteers -- the Joint had administrators who, we had volunteers who set up the <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="997">They had experience in working in <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="998">It was quite an exciting time in a way to do positive things -- to see children smiling, children who hadn't been incarcerated, because we'd seen firstly the Yugoslav children who had been starving, and we began to get pictures of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="999">We used to occasionally get shown German film that had been captured of the Nazis throwing children over the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, you know, it was ghastly, ghastly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1014">Q: Did you travel around <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or did you stay primarily in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1024">A: Right, for example, if I went down, let's say to Santa Maria di Bari, I would go there, first you'd see how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was running.</sentence><sentence id="1025">It was amazing how, without any experience, one became an expert.</sentence><sentence id="1026">I did have something kind of social administration training, and I think I was instinctively an administrator.</sentence><sentence id="1027">I would see what was needed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1028">For example, we had one of our unit members in charge of a search bureau which we set up immediately because the important thing was to try to reunite families.</sentence><sentence id="1029">We had no baby clothes because once people -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated and people began to lead normal lives, women began to menstruate again.</sentence><sentence id="1030">They hadn't menstruated all through the war, and being normal human beings they began to get pregnant and have babies.</sentence><sentence id="1031">We needed sanitary napkins for the women.</sentence><sentence id="1032">We needed baby clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1033">We needed special food for pregnant women.</sentence><sentence id="1034">There were some older people who survived.</sentence><sentence id="1035">We needed special food for them.</sentence><sentence id="1036">We needed doctors.</sentence><sentence id="1037">We needed more social workers.</sentence><sentence id="1038">And one could assess this, and gradually these people came in to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1039">It was exciting in the sense that you felt you could do something positive, and then the most important thing, I think, at that time was the search bureaus that we set up.</sentence><sentence id="1040">And they were interesting because, for example, you had to very quickly learn that the name "Schwartz", for example, S-c-h-w- a-r-t-z, can be spelled 30 different ways, and how do you distinguish?</sentence><sentence id="1041">How do you find Ivan Schwartz from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span>, for example?</sentence><sentence id="1042">You then knew you had to have his birthdays, his parents" names, their birthdays, where they were born, and you set up a very good system internationally.</sentence><sentence id="1043">The <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, at one point after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was liberated, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.3780433" long="9.0150471">Arolsen</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1044">There was a big unit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> set up by the World Jewish Congress and there was a big unit also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and I think they were right.</sentence><sentence id="1045">The most important thing was to help people find family.</sentence><sentence id="1046">This went on for years.</sentence><sentence id="1047">It still goes on.</sentence><sentence id="1048">People are still finding relatives, close relatives.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1080">A: And, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1082">Q: Right, so how did people find these lists?</sentence><sentence id="1083">Where were the lists placed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1086">A: Okay, I'll give you an example.</sentence><sentence id="1087">If we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and you came and you said, "My name is Joan Koppelbaum.</sentence><sentence id="1088">I come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I had a mother and father and three 7 sisters and four brothers, and I managed to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1090">I don't know what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="1091">My parents, I think, were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1092">I think my brothers and sisters may have escaped."</sentence><sentence id="1093">What we would do, we would send these lists of people who are asking for relatives to each <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and each <span class="BUILDING">office</span> would contact the next <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to see if they had any of these people registered with them.</sentence><sentence id="1094">We did use the Red Cross, but we found we were more efficient, I must be honest, than the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1095">Firstly, the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> took much longer than we did.</sentence><sentence id="1096">We knew that time was of the essence.</sentence><sentence id="1097">These lists were passed around, and we all got copies of these lists.</sentence><sentence id="1098">So, if we were looking for your relatives, we could look and say, "Hey!</sentence><sentence id="1099">Your aunt, we haven't found your parents yet, but your aunt is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1100">And very often, of course, when these people came to our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, all the <span class="DLF">walls</span> had their names written on them, and one would write, "I'm Ivan Schwartz.</sentence><sentence id="1101">I'm going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1102">Or "I'm Ivan Schwartz.</sentence><sentence id="1103">I'm going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1104">You will find me.</sentence><sentence id="1105">I will be with so-and-so."</sentence><sentence id="1106">It was like the tom-toms working.</sentence><sentence id="1107">And in the beginning, this is how people found each other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1130">Q: So, people would leave little messages about -</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: Oh, on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1141">And we had, let's say -- we had five or six <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, and these messages were on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1142">We would also take notes from them, but -- and, sometimes, a father would find a son in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I can't tell you the emotion of that moment.</sentence><sentence id="1143">Everybody was so thrilled, and everybody cried.</sentence><sentence id="1144">You know, I still get emotional because I saw so much of this.</sentence><sentence id="1145">It was wonderful, wonderful, and then you would hear the sadness.</sentence><sentence id="1146">You know, "Your mother got killed."</sentence><sentence id="1147">Or "I don't know where your mother is."</sentence><sentence id="1148">And sometimes it would take months and months to trace a family member, and as I say, they are still tracing family members.</sentence><sentence id="1149">I hear stories from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> today where they are still finding people alive in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> who they thought had died.</sentence><sentence id="1150">You know, in the old days, where we had immigration at the turn of the century, relatives lost touch with each other, and after this calamity, they certainly lost contact.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2067">A: No, supplies began to come in.</sentence><sentence id="2068">For example, we were very indiscriminate still at that time in using DDT to disinfest people.</sentence><sentence id="2069">You know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, we disinfested the Arabs, poor 1 souls.</sentence><sentence id="2070">God knows how much we got up our own nostrils.</sentence><sentence id="2071">Who knew it was such a poison?</sentence><sentence id="2072">And we stopped using DDT at one point, but I remember puffing it into the Arabs galobiers (ph), you know?</sentence><sentence id="2073">Things began to change as people began to get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, found family, decided they would immigrate, registered with a <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, had family members contact them.</sentence><sentence id="2074">Nobody would come in, and there was very little civilian traffic between Europe and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, and they still couldn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> except legally -- if they were going legally on a certificate.</sentence><sentence id="2075">So, movement was slow, but gradually things began to get a bit better, and as I say, as people began to find relatives, things were better.</sentence><sentence id="2076">It was very slow, very slow, and people were ill for a long time, a long time, and to get property back took years.</sentence><sentence id="2077">You couldn't see it in increments.</sentence><sentence id="2078">It didn't happen quickly.</sentence><sentence id="2079">Look how long it took to get reparations from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2080">They started in deg45 and the reparations began to come through at the end of the "40s, and these were with all the great powers working together and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> willing to give back in part.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2095">Q: How was it that you came to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2097">A: In August of 1946, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, my hero, a blessing really -- he really was a wonderful man with a wonderful sense of humor and a marvelous administrator -- asked me if I would go up into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2098">He said President Truman in December of 1945, on the 22"!</sentence><sentence id="2099">of December, had passed -- had issued a directive which enabled people who were displaced persons to get priority for American visas under the quota system.</sentence><sentence id="2100">In other words, they still had to go through the quota, but they would get visas rather than people, let's say, who'd lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or <span class="REGION">South America</span>, and he said they'd had somebody there working, but who hadn't panned out, and would I do this?</sentence><sentence id="2101">Well, I would have done anything this man asked me, and so I went up into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, but I knew nothing of American immigration law, and I must say, I sat down for four days with this American immigration law from 1924, I think it was, and then with the Truman Directive, and gradually began to get things together, and it didn't take too long.</sentence><sentence id="2102">Firstly, here was something very positive.</sentence><sentence id="2103">We were going to be able to help people to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> -- displaced persons and Austrian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2104">And the first problem we had was that those Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> who had returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were not considered displaced persons by the consuls, but the International Refugee Organization had registered them as displaced persons, which they were.</sentence><sentence id="2105">They didn't have their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2106">They didn't have their jobs.</sentence><sentence id="2107">Some of their family members had been killed, and so, we set up a test case.</sentence><sentence id="2108">When I say we, I was very brazen, I must confess, and I established a precedent case showing how this man -- I won't give you his name, he lives in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> today -- how this man had lost family, had lost his <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, had come back, had no where to live, was being housed by the American voluntary agency, and essentially he was still a displaced person, and we won the case.</sentence><sentence id="2109">So, he could get a visa and go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2110">When this happened, we could put through other Austrian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2111">There weren't too many left, and get them visas, and then we could help the others to get visas.</sentence><sentence id="2112">And the interesting thing was we began to work rather swiftly.</sentence><sentence id="2113">My thought was firstly we must get young people out because the young people are the future of any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2114">Secondly, we must get all 2 those people out who have relatives who will help them.</sentence><sentence id="2115">That meant they would not be a charge on the voluntary agency's funds, which really had to harness its money, and also it would give them back a normal life, and so these people began to move rather swiftly through the <span class="DLF">pipeline</span>, and it worked very well until the first Displaced Persons Act, American Displaced Persons Act of 1948.</sentence><sentence id="2116">This in a sense sounds like a mythical story, but I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and some members of the Displaced Persons Commission, I'll think of their names in a moment -- Carrousi (ph) and some other people, came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, I think it was on a Saturday, maybe it was a Friday, and said, "We're ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act.</sentence><sentence id="2117">Where are your job and housing assurances?</sentence><sentence id="2118">On the basis of those, we can give visas."</sentence><sentence id="2119">Frankly, I'd never seen a job and housing assurance.</sentence><sentence id="2120">I didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="2121">I knew we were going to have some, but we were waiting for our American agency to send the stuff over, and I said to these men, "Our job and housing assurances are at the printers, at the Allianz gebaude," which is the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where we took all our mimeographing.</sentence><sentence id="2122">If you would write one out for me, I'll go over there and get it mimeographed.</sentence><sentence id="2123">I was lying.</sentence><sentence id="2124">I'd never seen one.</sentence><sentence id="2125">They were very nice, these gentlemen.</sentence><sentence id="2126">They wrote it out.</sentence><sentence id="2127">I went over to the <span class="BUILDING">Allianz gebaude</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2128">1 mimeographed about 50.</sentence><sentence id="2129">I had all the cases which I knew were okay.</sentence><sentence id="2130">I issued a job and housing assurance for, and these went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and these people gave them visas.</sentence><sentence id="2131">I called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and told the director of immigration there what I had done and what the wording was on this thing so when these men eventually got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salz</span> -- I beg your pardon -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> in a few days, they were ready.</sentence><sentence id="2132">Now, our people began to get visas, and I must say within about ten days a cable came through to the director of the Joint in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, Harold Trobe, telling him that was Amy Zahl was doing was illegal and please stop her at once.</sentence><sentence id="2133">And he called me on the phone and told me this, and so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, I picked up every Jewish case I could find whether we would have been working with them or not, issued them job and housing assurances, and then stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2134">Now, what happened was as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> began to take passengers to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, and we were using <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transports</span>, there were a lot of Jews in the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>, about four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>, and the press in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, of course, "Only Jews are getting visas."</sentence><sentence id="2135">There were lots of anti-Semitic comments in the press, and I'm sure if you look at the press at that time, you'll find it was only because we were on the ball.</sentence><sentence id="2136">What we did do, of course, was tell the other <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> what they needed and how to go about it.</sentence><sentence id="2137">We didn't have a counsel of voluntary agencies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2138">We did when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but that was very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2139">I felt as though I was doing sort of some really dirty work, but we were helping people to get out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2183">Q: Can you explain what a job and housing assurance is?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2185">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2186">In order to get a visa, you no longer needed an affidavit from an individual.</sentence><sentence id="2187">What you needed was instead an assurance that you would have a job when you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and that you would have <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2188">And voluntary agencies were allowed to give these out because ostensibly, the voluntary agencies in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and asking them, and they were very good for all displaced persons, Jewish and non-Jewish, to give job and housing assurances which they did.</sentence><sentence id="2189">The Jewish 3 and all the other <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> were very cooperative, and many displaced persons did get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on the basis of those job and housing assurances.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2195">Q: Amy, was the assurance of a particular <span class="NPIP">job</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2197">A: A particular <span class="NPIP">job</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2199">Q: For this particular <span class="NPIP">person</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2201">A: For this particular person in a particular spot in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, in a particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2203">Q: So, then, how did you do it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2205">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2206">If, Ivan Schwartz came to me, and he had met the other provisions of the Truman Directive was -- which were that you had to have been in the American, British or French zones of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or the British, French or American zones of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> on December the 22", 1945, you were eligible.</sentence><sentence id="2207">If you were eligible, we could get a job -- we would contact the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and we would get -- this is under normal circumstances -- a job and housing assurance for Ivan Schwartz to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> to be a tailor, which he had been before, and on the basis of that, providing he passed his medical with the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, providing he passed his security with the CIC, the Counter Intelligence Corp, he would get a visa.</sentence><sentence id="2208">Those were the only people who were eligible.</sentence><sentence id="2209">So, what I did, since I had job and housing assurances already for people, I just had to sign a name to them.</sentence><sentence id="2210">In a sense, I did it without authority.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2217">Q: And did you do it thinking this person could do this job?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2219">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2221">Q: You just did it to -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2223">A: I had no idea what job they did.</sentence><sentence id="2224">I wanted to get these people out, and it worked.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2227">Q: Were these mainly men?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2229">A: Families.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2231">Q: Families?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2233">A: Oh, it was families and individuals.</sentence><sentence id="2234">It was whoever was eligible under the provisions of the directive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2237">Q: But you know why I'm asking?</sentence><sentence id="2238">Because are these jobs that are assured mainly jobs for men?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2243">A: Mostly, I would think they were jobs for men because women weren't a large part of the labor force in "45.</sentence><sentence id="2244">They were a very small part of the labor force except in <span class="BUILDING">munitions factories</span> and things like that, but in Europe women hadn't been part of the labor force before the war, and we're talking of people who hadn't worked since the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2247">Q: And may not have finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2249">A: May not have finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2251">Q: Was this and added burden for women then, unless they got married and were part of a family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2253">A: We didn't -- I don't seem to remember many individual women, and maybe as many women didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="2254">I don't remember as many women alone coming and trying to get out under the Displaced Persons Act.</sentence><sentence id="2255">That's a fascinating question because, when I think, I always think of families or husband and wives or single men.</sentence><sentence id="2256">I don't remember many single women.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2261">Q: Because one might wonder whether some of the women married sooner than they might have, knowing that they might be able to get out if they were married, but not if they were single.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2263">A: Right, and by the same token, some of the men might have married women they might not otherwise have married because they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, let's say, where the quota was good.</sentence><sentence id="2264">They were still working on the quota system, remember.</sentence><sentence id="2265">So, people married each other for different reasons, apart from the fact that they were fond of each other.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2269">Q: So, how long did you work in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2271">A: I worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from August "46 to October "48.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2273">Q: That's a long period.</sentence><sentence id="2274">Could you describe, I mean, you were doing these visas, were you going around and explaining to people how they could get visas?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2277">A: Yes, I used to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and explain what the law was, how they could become eligible.</sentence><sentence id="2278">I had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span>, and I would call these people together who run the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2279">So, we all ran on the same system.</sentence><sentence id="2280">It was a tiring job ina way.</sentence><sentence id="2281">You had to be on the ball all the time, and you had to have good people, but the system worked very well, and then, when in 1948, the Displaced Persons Act was passed, I was asked, again, by Dr. Schwartz to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2287">Q: I don't want you to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so fast.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2291">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2293">Q: I want to talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="2294">What was it like to -- did you lecture?</sentence><sentence id="2295">I mean, did you get into a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and lecture to a group of DPs to say this is what you-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2299">A: No, I learned German very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="2300">I learned it because I didn't trust interpreters.</sentence><sentence id="2301">I didn't know if they were working for the Russians or for the French or for the British or for the Americans, trying to catch me out.</sentence><sentence id="2302">You learned to be very wary living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2303">For example, we couldn't leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> without a propesk, a permit, from the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2304">I still have one as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="2305">And what we, I would do when I was going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, the other side of the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, I would get on -- there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American army train</span> known as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mozart</span>, and we would get on that and that was not inspected by the Russians, but you still had to have a permit to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2306">What was the rest of your question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2315">Q: I was asking whether you would get in front of a large group of DPs and lecture to them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2317">A: No, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2318">I would go up, let's say, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, and talk to the people in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and then I'd go into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="2319">I learned Yiddish, also, and I learned to speak with a Polish accent.</sentence><sentence id="2320">There's a different accent if you're a Russian Jew or Lithuanian Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2321">You have a softer accent.</sentence><sentence id="2322">I would talk to them in German or in Yiddish about what they had to do, and why it was taking so long from their point of view, that there was no need to try and come, let's say, to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, which some of them would try to do or to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2323">We didn't have the staff to cope with large numbers, but what was happening and what we were doing and I think the fact that we kept them informed of what we were doing helped to stop any rioting that we might have had.</sentence><sentence id="2324">I don't remember any rioting at all, actually.</sentence><sentence id="2325">We had people who would be very irate and come in and bang the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and make all kinds of threats, but I think it helped having <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> where, you may laugh at this, where we set up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> where they could sit and wait, because when I first came in, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> for visitors.</sentence><sentence id="2326">They lined up, and one by one they went in and stood by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2327">Well, this whole thing of dignity which I'd learned at a very early age.</sentence><sentence id="2328">People -- you don't give them dignity by making them stand and you sit.</sentence><sentence id="2329">| remember, what we did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I did it again in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2330">We got a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urn</span>, and made coffee, and the nicest person I could find, usually a nice Hungarian boy, I would put in charge of the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span>, and he'd offer people coffee.</sentence><sentence id="2331">They were unused to this.</sentence><sentence id="2332">A lot of people wouldn't drink our coffee because they were ultra-orthodox, but other people would, and we would have newspapers in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and as I told you, they'd go along the <span class="DLF">walls</span> scribbling their names and where they were going to or leaving notes with somebody and they'd meet each other.</sentence><sentence id="2333">It became a meeting place.</sentence><sentence id="2334">It worked.</sentence><sentence id="2335">It worked.</sentence><sentence id="2336">Sometimes, they had to wait a long time in order to get seen because we didn't have colossal staff.</sentence><sentence id="2337">The work was tedious.</sentence><sentence id="2338">For the consuls, you had to have everything in order, and we weren't only working on American immigration.</sentence><sentence id="2339">We were working on immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2340">No, we weren't doing the Palestine immigration now.</sentence><sentence id="2341">Palestine 6 was being handled by the Jewish agency.</sentence><sentence id="2342">We were not working on <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2343">That's an error.</sentence><sentence id="2344">We were working on <span class="REGION">South America</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span>, and the paperwork was very slow, but people did begin to move out.</sentence><sentence id="2345">But the Truman Directive was wonderful because, for the first time, numbers of people began to leave, numbers, and the <span class="BUILDING">Rothschild Hospital</span>, which was housing so many of these people, began gradually to get -- to lessen in number its occupants.</sentence><sentence id="2346">But it was hard work.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2419">A: Well, I remember one of the -- I know -- I remember the name of the man who was in charge of the INS in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2420">When he told Dorothea Green, who headed up the ORT, Organization for Rehabilitation and Training, who is a very lovely lady, very handsome, and she was fighting for a case, and he said to her, "Lady, you're here to get these people in.</sentence><sentence id="2421">We're here to keep them out."</sentence><sentence id="2422">And she didn't lie.</sentence><sentence id="2423">And I'm sure this was their attitude.</sentence><sentence id="2424">They didn't like these people.</sentence><sentence id="2425">After all, they didn't speak English.</sentence><sentence id="2426">They weren't well dressed by a long shot, and these men didn't like them, and maybe they'd been given instructions to try and keep them out.</sentence><sentence id="2427">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2428">No, that was pretty tough, but the -- in 7 the first instance, these people didn't go to the INS until they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2429">So, they were held back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2430">Later on, when the Displaced Persons Act came into being, they sent the INS into different <span class="REGION">regions</span> so people didn't accumulate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, but rather went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> knowing they were going to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2449">Q: Well, did you see with clients?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2451">A: I was in charge of the administration, but I handled what I considered to be difficult cases.</sentence><sentence id="2452">For example, if one of my workers said to me, "Amy, you know, I'm not sure that this man's papers are really genuine."</sentence><sentence id="2453">Because I must say, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Joint</span> was very, very careful.</sentence><sentence id="2454">It would've been foolish for us to sponsor cases of people whose documents were false, because we might have ruined for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2455">I would then take on that case.</sentence><sentence id="2456">Firstly, it was very time consuming, and there were plenty of people lined up, and I developed a means of questioning people where, if they could pass my surveillance, I would think that their papers were genuine.</sentence><sentence id="2457">If it became apparent to me that really these papers were false, I would say to this person, "You know, we can get you into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> as either a furrier or a tailor or this or that.</sentence><sentence id="2458">So, you could -- excuse me -- you could meet your relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2459">Or, if you would like to take your family to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, we" ll try and get you there."</sentence><sentence id="2460">But, I would not sponsor that case.</sentence><sentence id="2461">That case became a no-no in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2462">No, we were very careful in that sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2475">Q: Can you give me a sense of what it would mean to have a false paper?</sentence><sentence id="2476">What is that kind of documentation people had to have?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2479">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2480">It was sad.</sentence><sentence id="2481">These people had to prove that they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> on December the gore.</sentence><sentence id="2482">1945.</sentence><sentence id="2483">Now, some of them had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to look for family and not found them.</sentence><sentence id="2484">So, on December the 22"4,1945, they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> rather than in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they would make false papers to say they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Germany town</span> on that date, so that they could pass.</sentence><sentence id="2485">Now, it sound became apparent, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service would say to them, "What color were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2486">because they knew.</sentence><sentence id="2487">And very soon, of course, the survivors knew what color the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> were.</sentence><sentence id="2488">When you think back, it was horrid to treat people with such indignity, people who had suffered so much and who had gone to look for relatives and this was their crime because, because of that, they couldn't get visas to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2489">It was horrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2505">A: You couldn't afford to be angry.</sentence><sentence id="2506">You had to find ways to overcome this stupidity.</sentence><sentence id="2507">You got angry for your clients because you knew they were decent and fine people who perhaps been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, or they'd be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koraganda</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because they had fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and then come back, and they worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2508">They suffered, and here are these people treating them like gangsters because -- criminals rather, because they hadn't been in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> on a certain date.</sentence><sentence id="2509">They may have come over three days later, by the way, and that was awful.</sentence><sentence id="2510">That made you very sad, very sad because sometimes a mother would get a visa and her adult son wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="2511">And then what we try and do is help the adult son get to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> because we knew that through <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, they could work something out where the two relatives could be joined again.</sentence><sentence id="2512">It was hard to watch.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2529">Q: Amy, give me some idea.</sentence><sentence id="2530">You were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> for a rather long time, close to two years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2533">A: More than two years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2535">Q: More than two years.</sentence><sentence id="2536">What was it like to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> during that time?</sentence><sentence id="2537">Did you meet with Austrians as well as the refugees and the survivors that you were helping?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2541">A: We didn't meet with Austrians.</sentence><sentence id="2542">It was a very difficult situation in the sense that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was occupied by the Americans, the French, the British and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2543">Each had a <span class="REGION">sector</span>, and there was an <span class="REGION">international sector</span>, and one had to be very careful not to go into the <span class="REGION">Russian sector</span> at this time, because you could be arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2544">So, it was a bit difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2545">Also, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had been bombed, and the only accommodation they had for people like us was in <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and what were formerly known as studen (ph) <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2546">Those were <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> where somebody came for an hour, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were very tiny, and that, I found, very difficult to live with, and so I got myself a billet in a private <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of some Austrians and had at least a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> that I could move around in to myself, and it was a bit further out from the center.</sentence><sentence id="2547">So, it was fairly pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="2548">But they had no heating and I had to supply coal to heat my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2549">But it wasn't bad.</sentence><sentence id="2550">You know, I'd come from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, remember, not too long ago, and we didn't have <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to heat after the bombing.</sentence><sentence id="2551">So, that was okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2563">Q: And were these older Austrians?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2565">A: No, these were younger people.</sentence><sentence id="2566">The husband had been a Nazi, but as he said, if he weren't a member of the Nazi party, you couldn't run a business, and I must say, I believed him also that he was a decent man because, when I was there, he was often sent packages from Jews who he'd help to get the Argentine, and they were sending him food packages.</sentence><sentence id="2567">So, he couldn't have been all bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2571">Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2573">A: I beg your pardon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2575">Q: Is that your main association with Austrian citizens?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2577">A: With Austrian citizens, well, I had Austrians working in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, Austrian Jews, but I didn't -- I had very little contact or almost no contact with Austrians per se.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2579">Q: Did other members -- actually, how many members of your staff were there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2581">A: In the <span class="BUILDING">immigration office</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2582">I had another person from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who was my secretary and confidant, there was a man who originally had been from -- had been Austrian, he now 0 lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, and he helped.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And then there must have been eight other local staff, and they were Jewish, essentially because we wanted to give Jews employment, and so we were about a dozen people in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> alone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2587">Q: But, you had -- you administered a number of <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2589">A: Yes, this was the <span class="BUILDING">Viennese office</span>, which I worked in as well as administrating.</sentence><sentence id="2590">Then I administered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>, the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, which was the other side of the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, and the one in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span>, and then we had representatives in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> because we would go out to them to save people having to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, which they couldn't do unless they had permits to go through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, and that, nobody was keen to do at this time.</sentence><sentence id="2591">We would go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and tell them things which were necessary for them to know, or collect papers, or bring them papers for signature.</sentence><sentence id="2592">It was a bit of an awkward program, although it worked very well.</sentence><sentence id="2593">Or they could go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>, where there papers were held.</sentence><sentence id="2594">It was not an easy situation actually because we were always worried that there might be Russians around trying to pick up people because sometimes we had Russian army officers who were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2595">For example, a woman came to me one day dressed almost in rags with dyed hair looking very ugly, and she said her husband and daughter were in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2596">She was a doctor in the Russian army, and there was a certificate for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for her at the <span class="BUILDING">British consulate</span>, could we help her?</sentence><sentence id="2597">Well, the first thing you think is, "A ha!</sentence><sentence id="2598">She's a spy.</sentence><sentence id="2599">She wants to see what we're doing."</sentence><sentence id="2600">And I took all her particulars and I went across to the <span class="BUILDING">British consulate</span>, and sure enough there was a certificate, but that wasn't enough as far as I was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="2601">I contacted friends who were working with the Jewish agency for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, told them the story, and asked them to check in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that she did indeed have a husband and a daughter there, because one never knew how honest these people were.</sentence><sentence id="2602">There were many ways by which you could trick somebody, and the answer eventually came back that yes, her husband and daughter were there and they confirmed her story.</sentence><sentence id="2603">Now, how was I to get her out?</sentence><sentence id="2604">She had to come at times when very few people were around.</sentence><sentence id="2605">I had to try and do everything so that she wouldn't be seen, and eventually I got her certificate, and how to send her to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> which was in the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2606">And the only way to do it was to take her myself, and don't think I wasn't scared.</sentence><sentence id="2607">I'm not so brave, but she sat in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with me and we handed in her papers, and my propesk, my permit to go into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, and we put her on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2608">And there were others.</sentence><sentence id="2609">I had a young woman who was working at the <span class="BUILDING">Polish consulate</span>, who had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2610">My goodness, my memory's going back, and she said she had a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, and again, I was suspicious, and checked her out in the same way.</sentence><sentence id="2611">I checked through the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and then I checked with the agency, the Jewish agency working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, and they confirmed her story, and she told the Poles at that time she was going on vacation, and off she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2612">It was tricky doing this because you were always suspicious that perhaps these people were not genuine, and that you might be picked up yourself on the <span class="DLF">street</span> because people were being picked up, particularly by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2613">People would be walking along and suddenly a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> would stop, and like a 1 gangster film, people would be whisked off and not seen again.</sentence><sentence id="2614">It never happened to any of us.</sentence><sentence id="2615">I'm just adding drama to the story, I guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2643">Q: Who were they picking up?</sentence><sentence id="2644">Who were they looking for?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2647">A: Ihave no idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2649">Q: You don't know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2651">A: No idea, perhaps they were Russians who'd defected, could be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2653">Q: Now, this Russian woman who had been a doctor in the army, why did you have to bring her into your <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> when very few people were there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2655">A: I didn't want her to be seen.</sentence><sentence id="2656">Maybe I was scared, but I thought the less people who knew of her or who saw her, the better.</sentence><sentence id="2657">I remember her name.</sentence><sentence id="2658">Her name was Hasia Rapaport, and I remember it very distinctly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2663">Q: Did you ever meet her later on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2665">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2667">Q: Were you also nervous that people who would see her might denounce her to somebody?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2669">I mean, that there was-</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2670">A: Well, they couldn't because they didn't -- she liked look any other poor person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2671">She had dyed red hair, and very -- dressed very ordinarily, and heaven knows where she got her clothes from.</sentence><sentence id="2672">She wasn't in uniform when she came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2673">She was too sensible for that, and she had guts actually to come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, but her story was true.</sentence><sentence id="2674">And I remember the Polish person, and often when we go to -- out in the evening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, we would meet Russian officers who were Jews in the Russian army who were not going to defect.</sentence><sentence id="2675">They were Russians, but when you had a husband and a daughter in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, of course, you were going to defect if you could.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2682">Q: How did the husband and the daughter get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2683">Do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2686">A: They must have gone when war started, or before war started.</sentence><sentence id="2687">I have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="2688">I didn't ask her that question, but they probably went -- that's right, they couldn't have gone legally.</sentence><sentence id="2689">They must have gone the long way around -- the <span class="DLF">land route</span> as we call it, go through <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, and then make their way down.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2694">Q: Did you ever have a circumstance where the story was really not true and you had to say no to somebody?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2698">A: No, I don't remember such a story.</sentence><sentence id="2699">I don't think they would've had the guts to come to us because they didn't know how we respond, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2700">They may have been -- we had Germans who tried to pass themselves off as displaced persons, as Jews, in order to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and sometimes somebody, let's say, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> when they'd pass and they had their visa, would recognize them as having been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, had been one of the workers there, and of course they had to be imprisoned for their own safety, but we discovered very early on that when a German held up his arms, his blood group number was tattooed under his arm.</sentence><sentence id="2701">So, if we were suspicious, we could ask the doctor or somebody to examine him, but I'm sure Germans got through as Jewish displaced persons and probably lived a life as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2702">People try all kinds of things and get away with it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2708">Q: Are there any other situations in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> you would like to tell us about before we move to your next?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2710">A: Well, some of the things we did in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, we had to use our wits.</sentence><sentence id="2711">I think that's essentially the thing.</sentence><sentence id="2712">For example, I don't know if I had told you earlier about the people who had visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2716">Q: No, tell us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2718">A: And I knew that their relatives actually were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Para</span>--I beg your pardon in the Argentine.</sentence><sentence id="2719">Well, obviously, the Argentine at that time was not giving visas to Jews, and so the relatives over there were sensible or smart, they got visas for <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> and we would get transit visas for the Argentine that one could get, and when they got to the Argentine, they had ways of whisking them off.</sentence><sentence id="2720">So, I remember I would sometimes have to go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> because that's where the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> was, and I remember having a large family of about 13 people -- Schmuck Lieberman and another name.</sentence><sentence id="2721">I don't remember them now.</sentence><sentence id="2722">And I went into the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, and they weren't very ready to give visas because they consuls made their living, in a way, from the visa fees they charged.</sentence><sentence id="2723">You know, they were honorary consuls; they weren't civil servants.</sentence><sentence id="2724">And so I would go in and very brazenly say, "Of course, I know your secretary will have to work extra time, and if there's anything we could do to compensate for that we would be very happy."</sentence><sentence id="2725">My way of offering a bribe, which was gladly accepted, and I would get these visas, and very discreetly in an envelope leave my payment and walk out.</sentence><sentence id="2726">But, you see, people who hadn't been used to having to -- what's the word? --</sentence><sentence id="2727">find their way, wouldn't do this kind of thing, and I remember the very nice woman who was running the <span class="BUILDING">Prague office</span> for the American Joint was astounded that I could come to her within one day and show her that Thad 13 visas. "</sentence><sentence id="2728">You must have paid," she said.</sentence><sentence id="2729">I said, "Who would dream of paying?"</sentence><sentence id="2730">You couldn't even tell your own what you were doing because if they didn't know themselves how to do it, you could never teach them how.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2744">Q: How do you think you picked this up?</sentence><sentence id="2745">Knowing how to arrange things, because you're right, people say, "I don't pay for things.</sentence><sentence id="2746">I don't barter for things.</sentence><sentence id="2747">I simply do-" 3</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2752">A: Well, you had to know.</sentence><sentence id="2753">I think you knew you had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="2754">You had to get these visas.</sentence><sentence id="2755">You had to get these people out, and if you couldn't do it by being honest, since the Argentineans weren't offering visas, you had to do it dishonestly.</sentence><sentence id="2756">I didn't think I was doing anything dishonest because I was helping people to join relatives, and you thought of a thousand ways.</sentence><sentence id="2757">How did people survive who didn't land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, if they didn't think of a thousand ruses to survive?</sentence><sentence id="2758">And I suppose this is part of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2766">Q: So, but there is a difference because you said a number of times that you didn't want to do anything that was illegal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2768">A: Not if I could help it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2770">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2772">A: But, when I had to get visas for the Argentine, transit visas, and I knew that the only way to get them was for the relatives to get the Paraguayan visas, there was no problem, and if I knew, as I did, that the consul was not anxious even to give transit visas to Jews, then you had to get them by other means.</sentence><sentence id="2773">I mean, look at the people who landed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span>, before and during the war.</sentence><sentence id="2774">They had no more intention of staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> then you or I would have had, but this was their way of getting out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2778">Q: How did you distinguish between what was illegal and what was just sort of pushing the envelope?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2780">A: I never even thought about what was legal or illegal.</sentence><sentence id="2781">I did everything to my knowledge legally, but when I had to help families get to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that didn't want them, but I knew they relatives could help them to stay there, and the general community wasn't against them coming in, why not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2784">Q: Amy, when you took this job -- actually, did you start to get paid at any point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2786">A: Yes, I did.</sentence><sentence id="2787">After three years, Dr. Schwartz asked me if I'd like to come on to the American Joint's payroll, and I said I thought that would be nice because by then I mean, I was very broke.</sentence><sentence id="2788">I had no money, and he offered me a salary at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2789">It wasn't very high, but it was much more than I'd been getting as a volunteer, and I felt, "Well, three years of voluntary service, I had paid my way."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2794">Q: So, does that mean, was it 46 or "47?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2796">A: This was in forty -- toward the end of "46, I came on to the JDC payroll.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2874">A: Mixed.</sentence><sentence id="2875">Some of the men were older, quite a bit older, but it's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2876">I never thought of age in those days.</sentence><sentence id="2877">I never thought that somebody was older or younger.</sentence><sentence id="2878">Occasionally, 5 you would find you came into an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> like when I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and there was a man working there much older than I who was very entrepreneurial, and I didn't trust him any further than I could throw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">grand piano</span>, and I knew I had to get rid of him.</sentence><sentence id="2879">And it took a little time, but very graciously, we paid him off and got him out because he was dishonest.</sentence><sentence id="2880">He was taking money from people to get them visas, and that, to me, was anathema.</sentence><sentence id="2881">So, I won't tell you his name.</sentence><sentence id="2882">I remember it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2892">Q: You do, but you won't tell right?</sentence><sentence id="2893">So, what happened in 1948?</sentence><sentence id="2894">You then got -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2898">A: Oh, in 1948, this was an interesting year.</sentence><sentence id="2899">The Americans passed the Displaced Persons Act, the first one where displaced persons if they had job and housing assurances, could get visas for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2900">It didn't depend on which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they had lived.</sentence><sentence id="2901">In other words, it wasn't a quota system.</sentence><sentence id="2902">And this was fascinating because, one day, I don't know if it was a Friday or a Saturday, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> -- I must say we didn't know whether it was Monday or Tuesday or Saturday or Sunday when we worked -- Mr. Gruzo and Henry Rosenfeld and some others from the Displaced Persons Commission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> appeared in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, charming gentleman.</sentence><sentence id="2903">They were ready to issue visas under the Displaced Persons Act.</sentence><sentence id="2904">Well, I assure you that none of the voluntary agency personnel of all the agencies knew the first thing about what we were supposed to have had, but they were ready to issue visas.</sentence><sentence id="2905">And so, I said to them, "Unfortunately, my job and housing assurances are at the printers, but if you'd write one out for me.</sentence><sentence id="2906">I'll take it over to the <span class="BUILDING">allianz gebaude</span>," which was the <span class="BUILDING">American building</span> where they had mimeograph machines, "I'll get some printed out, and you can start work."</sentence><sentence id="2907">And so they were very nice gentlemen.</sentence><sentence id="2908">They wrote it down.</sentence><sentence id="2909">I took it over, and came back with 50 or 60, and we took the cases in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and everyone they thought was eligible, I gave a job and housing assurance to, and pumps!,</sentence><sentence id="2910">a few days later they were issuing the visas.</sentence><sentence id="2911">The next day, or perhaps that evening, I called our <span class="BUILDING">Munich office</span> of the American Joint and told the man who was director there what we were doing and gave him the wording so that when these people arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, they would be ready, and quite a number of people got visas.</sentence><sentence id="2912">In about ten days, a message came through from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from the United Service for New Americans, which was our cooperating agency.</sentence><sentence id="2913">They contacted all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where there were relatives and actually arranged the immigration of relatives to relatives or of people without relatives to people who were offering them jobs and <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2914">They were very efficient.</sentence><sentence id="2915">But they cabled our <span class="BUILDING">Paris office</span> saying, "What Amy Zahl is doing is illegal.</sentence><sentence id="2916">Tell her to stop immediately."</sentence><sentence id="2917">And Harold Trobe who was director of the joint operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> called me and said, "Amy, I've had this cable."</sentence><sentence id="2918">And I said, "Hmm, very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2919">We will stop."</sentence><sentence id="2920">And, of course, what I did, I went into the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> where they were very cooperative, let me put it that way, it was a very nice consul.</sentence><sentence id="2921">Sometimes the consuls were not at all cooperative.</sentence><sentence id="2922">In times when life was a stake before the war, the consuls were not very cooperative, but these people were very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2923">I looked through all the Jewish cases I could find whether they were registered with the Joint Distribution Committee or with HIAS (ph), or not registered with an agency, and gave them all job and housing assurances, and then I stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2924">Now, what happened as a result was these people got 6 visas.</sentence><sentence id="2925">They were sent up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, and they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> going to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in larger numbers than non-Jews sponsored by non-Jewish agencies because they hadn't had this first encounter with the Displaced Persons Commission, and the press in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was rather anti-Semitic, you know, "only Jews are getting visas."</sentence><sentence id="2926">You can look up the press at the time and see these notices.</sentence><sentence id="2927">What we did, of course, was to tell the Christian agencies what we had done, told them what the wording was so they could get started, but I think we had more support from our agency than they had from theirs.</sentence><sentence id="2928">I know when it came to children, for example, I was always horrified both when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and later in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to find children -- and, when I say children, I mean youngsters under 18 -- still either in <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2929">Although the American -- I've got the name of the agency, the refugee agency taking care of orphans -- was working, they were working very slowly, and I just couldn't bear the thought that there were kids without families still sitting in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and this is what?</sentence><sentence id="2930">18 months after the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="2931">And so, what we would do is take these children and take them away from the other <span class="BUILDING">agency</span>, and get them visas to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2932">It was exciting in that you thought you were helping people, and because we could work so efficiently, we saw the results in a very short time.</sentence><sentence id="2933">When I finished the first batch in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, Dr. Schwartz came to me again in the October of *46, and said would I go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and take over the operation there?</sentence><sentence id="2934">With working very successfully in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and I had very good assistance working in the <span class="BUILDING">Vienna office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2935">Everybody was strained.</sentence><sentence id="2936">I always worked as though I was leaving tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="2937">It was a good way to work because it meant if I wanted to take time off, the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> would function, the files would be working, and I felt that none of us should try to make ourselves indispensable.</sentence><sentence id="2938">We, after all, were working to save people's lives.</sentence><sentence id="2939">I always felt that.</sentence><sentence id="2940">And so, on October the 28") 1948, I came up into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, which was the <span class="BUILDING">head office</span> for the German operation, and there was chaos.</sentence><sentence id="2941">The staff there were on strike.</sentence><sentence id="2942">About 200 letters a day were coming in from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because the American operations, as I mentioned earlier, were very efficient, and there was nobody working.</sentence><sentence id="2943">They were on strike.</sentence><sentence id="2944">They wanted better pay.</sentence><sentence id="2945">I was horrified.</sentence><sentence id="2946">I came into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and a young woman, an American, Gladys Roth, was running the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at that time, and I wanted her to take over the volkcaserna (ph), where people went in order to get processed for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2947">She was a very efficient worker, very sympathetic, spoke excellent Hungarian, spoke some German, and was a good worker.</sentence><sentence id="2948">She too felt you had to help these people to get out -- a wonderful sense of humor, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="2949">She was a lifesaver.</sentence><sentence id="2950">And I called these people together who were on strike, and I said I would look into their salary claims, but not unless they came back to work because what they were doing was stopping people leaving and they themselves were being stopped from leaving.</sentence><sentence id="2951">So, this doesn't make sense to me.</sentence><sentence id="2952">And I said, "I'll expect you all in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> tomorrow morning."</sentence><sentence id="2953">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the morning and there was some staff, and the next morning there were a few more, and I let word out that if the rest didn't come back to work by the end of the week I was going to employ new people.</sentence><sentence id="2954">They were all back.</sentence><sentence id="2955">There were some troublemakers.</sentence><sentence id="2956">For example, the way they had been operating was if people had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to pick up transit visas, they would hire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coaches</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and two of the boys who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> would go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2957">Well, you know what this leaves them open to.</sentence><sentence id="2958">They could take cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="2959">They could do bribes.</sentence><sentence id="2960">I don't know what they did, but I knew 7 this had to stop, and I let it go on for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="2961">You don't change things immediately, and one day I said, "You know, we have to let these people really go out on their own so that they face the world for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="2962">So, let's try one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without you on it."</sentence><sentence id="2963">Well, no, they found a thousand reasons, but I was very firm and the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went off, and was successful.</sentence><sentence id="2964">And then I announced that no more would we have to accompany these people.</sentence><sentence id="2965">That was my way of handling that, and then in December, they decided to go on strike again.</sentence><sentence id="2966">I was in trouble because I didn't know what I could offer.</sentence><sentence id="2967">Sam Haber was running the operation.</sentence><sentence id="2968">He was a tough guy to cope with, and I said I would see them the next day, and talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="2969">I came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and there was not a soul in sight.</sentence><sentence id="2970">And I felt, "I have failed."</sentence><sentence id="2971">I was so horrified, and what could I do, and my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there was a great big shout, "Happy Birthday!"</sentence><sentence id="2972">I had forgotten it was my birthday, and they were all up there.</sentence><sentence id="2973">I wept.</sentence><sentence id="2974">I was so astounded to find them all there, and friends, obviously they were now my friends.</sentence><sentence id="2975">I've still got the birthday card they made me out of a manila folder, that big and they'd all signed it, and that was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2976">From then on, we got along very well.</sentence><sentence id="2977">The men who had accompanied the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, I helped to immigrate very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="2978">I thought that was the best thing for them.</sentence><sentence id="2979">And I tried not to employ people who would have to immigrate now.</sentence><sentence id="2980">The Czechs -- you may not know this historically, you may know it better than I -- had thrown out the volksdeutsch, and there were some lovely young people amongst those who came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who, through no fault of their own, were thrown out as revenge, and I employed some of these girls.</sentence><sentence id="2981">I made sure they hadn't been members of the BDM, the Bund Deutscher Mddel, and by the way, it was easy to check it because the Germans were so methodical, they had lists.</sentence><sentence id="2982">So, I employed these people, but then the rabbis were insulted.</sentence><sentence id="2983">I was employing non-Jews when Jews needed jobs, and I met with them, and I said, "My job is to get the Jews out of here who don't belong here, and the only way I can do that is to employ non-Jews who are clean and let the others get out."</sentence><sentence id="2984">Some of these girls married Jewish boys.</sentence><sentence id="2985">They were lovely girls, and they worked very efficiently, but these were some of the hurdles one had to cope with.</sentence><sentence id="2986">The rabbis were always watching that we did the right thing.</sentence><sentence id="2987">For example, I had permission to send what we called "highly pregnant women", women in their eighth month, by <span class="DLF">air</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> because if they couldn't leave and they had babies, they couldn't go on these cargo -- not cargo, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military ships</span> and the visa might expire.</sentence><sentence id="2988">It was only good for four months.</sentence><sentence id="2989">I had an arrangement with Air France.</sentence><sentence id="2990">For every ten people I put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, I got one free <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2991">And so these women would come to me, you know, "I'm in my ninth month." "</sentence><sentence id="2992">I'm in my eighth month."</sentence><sentence id="2993">And I got to the stage when I could look at a woman, and say, "You're seven and a half months pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="2994">You have time."</sentence><sentence id="2995">It was very funny because we played jokes together.</sentence><sentence id="2996">I'm just remembering this.</sentence><sentence id="2997">We sent a lot of people by <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2998">Now, some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> sailed on a Saturday and the Orthodox Jews would not sail on Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="2999">Some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> went on Friday evening.</sentence><sentence id="3000">We made arrangements with the captains of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and the captains of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3001">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, the passengers were allowed to embark before the Sabbath came in, therefore it was their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3002">They were allowed to get onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> the day before the Sabbath, so that this already was their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and there was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="3003">But, you had to think of all kinds of things to stop people from staying behind.</sentence><sentence id="3004">Occasionally, you'd have somebody 8 who was having a pair of trousers made, and therefore he couldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="3005">It wasn't that he was having trousers made.</sentence><sentence id="3006">In a sense, a lot of these people were scared to leave.</sentence><sentence id="3007">I think that's what I thought about them, and so I would call his tailor and if he was having trousers made, I used to tell him, "You have to have them by tonight because otherwise he's going to lose his visa."</sentence><sentence id="3008">The tailors were usually pretty good.</sentence><sentence id="3009">They were either displaced pers- mostly displaced persons or Germans, and they knew what was happening and they would finish the pants, and these people would go on.</sentence><sentence id="3010">I only once met a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I was there who at some kind of gathering, he looked at me and said, "Zie haben mae swandon heir sukammen." (</sentence><sentence id="3011">ph) He was a German Jew who said I forced him to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and his wife said, "Ignore him."</sentence><sentence id="3012">But, he was a man who was having pants made.</sentence><sentence id="3013">It was fascinating working with those people.</sentence><sentence id="3014">People had all kinds of excuses for not going, and I really felt they were scared.</sentence><sentence id="3015">After all, some of them were coming to relatives they haven't seen since before the war or they had never seen.</sentence><sentence id="3016">A mother's relative who had come a generation ago.</sentence><sentence id="3017">I can understand it.</sentence><sentence id="3018">I would be horrified to have to go to a relative who was going to support me who I didn't know, or my mother had told me stories they didn't like.</sentence><sentence id="3019">It was fascinating, fascinating, but you had to get -- firstly, you had to get these people out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3020">They were not wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3021">There was no future for them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3022">And secondly, one knew that once they got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, they could begin to rebuild for themselves and the new children they had.</sentence><sentence id="3023">It was fortunate that so many of them did have children because this gave them a future.</sentence><sentence id="3024">They were concerned for their children, and that was one of the reasons for leaving.</sentence><sentence id="3025">We also had situations where non-Jews had helped Jews in hiding, and I remember Andre Bulova's sister, Bulova watch company, his sister was a Mrs. Godem (ph) came to see me, and for some reason, she liked me.</sentence><sentence id="3026">She said, "Do you have people you would like to help and you can't."</sentence><sentence id="3027">I said, "Yes, I've got heads of families who are non-Jews."</sentence><sentence id="3028">And we essentially helped families where the head of the family was a Jew because they would fit into a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3029">She said, "I will give you affidavits worth a million dollars each, and you send them to my brother and we will find jobs for them."</sentence><sentence id="3030">And there was one man who had hidden his wife through the war, and he did beautiful work, enamel on silver, and he brought in several -- I shall never forget this -- several small dishes in a way to show me of work he did.</sentence><sentence id="3031">It was all very beautiful, and when I told Mrs. Godem, because she would come back and forth, she said, "He can do watch covers.</sentence><sentence id="3032">My brother would be very pleased to see him."</sentence><sentence id="3033">And this man said to me, "Which one do you like the best?"</sentence><sentence id="3034">Well, I knew he was saying to me, "I will give you that one."</sentence><sentence id="3035">I said, "They're all beautiful."</sentence><sentence id="3036">I wouldn't admire any, and the only gift I ever have or had from a survivor or from a refugee was a dish he sent to me.</sentence><sentence id="3037">He knew I wouldn't take it.</sentence><sentence id="3038">We allowed them to bring flowers to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and sometimes it looked like a <span class="BUILDING">mortuary</span>, there were so many flowers, but gifts were forbidden because gifts lead to bribes.</sentence><sentence id="3039">But I have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> still this lovely tray he gave me.</sentence><sentence id="3040">It's a dish about six inches in diameter, St.George and the Dragon.</sentence><sentence id="3041">I think he must have made it for me.</sentence><sentence id="3042">And, they did very well in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3043">We had some wonderful people, we really did, who immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is richer for them.</sentence><sentence id="3044">It really is.</sentence><sentence id="3045">The operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> went quite successfully, I would say, because we got all the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> to work in the same fashion.</sentence><sentence id="3046">We set up some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">filing systems</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3047">When we had people from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> who came into 9 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, we had the same system for handing them.</sentence><sentence id="3048">There was one case of a young man who I sent ostensibly to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3049">His name was Miklaus Rezmowitz.</sentence><sentence id="3050">He was Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="3051">I had found him on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and what I did, I got the <span class="BUILDING">Joint office</span> to set up a small <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> for me where if I put kids there, they had a whole sheet to themselves on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and I tried to find them jobs, and I tried to get them out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as soon as possible.</sentence><sentence id="3052">And I sent Mickey through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3053">When I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 18 months later, somebody told me -- because there always was a <span class="DLF">grapevine</span> -- that Mickey was working in a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and I was horrified.</sentence><sentence id="3054">This sweet little boy, to me he was a baby.</sentence><sentence id="3055">And I got him to come to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he told me when he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, for some reason something happened and the visa wasn't picked up and nobody helped him, and he didn't want to write and tell me because I'd been so kind to him, and so he let his visa lapse.</sentence><sentence id="3056">Well, I started immediately to work on his visa, and discovered he had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3057">I may have mentioned to you that even to this day, people are finding relatives.</sentence><sentence id="3058">His brother had escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and was there, and I decided when I eventually got Mickey's visa, I would bring the brother in from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3059">Eventually, we got a visa for Mickey, and I got his brother to come and we put him up in our <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3707">Q: Amy, I wanted to give people a sense of what the 1948 DP Immigration Act brought as opposed to what the Truman Directive was in 1945.</sentence><sentence id="3708">What was the difference?</sentence><sentence id="3709">I mean, what happened because of the Immigration Act?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3713">A: Well, it was very different from the Truman Directive.</sentence><sentence id="3714">That gave the first ray of hope to people that they might get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but when they passed the DP Act, this was the first time, really, that people could come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> outside of a quota number and on the basis of a job and housing assurance which somebody perhaps they didn't know had given them.</sentence><sentence id="3715">Whereas, before affidavits were generally given by close relatives who undertook, of course, to ensure that they would not be come a charge on public funds.</sentence><sentence id="3716">This was a totally different concept, and the Truman government at the time really is to be congratulated in having shown a humanitarian aspect of US immigration law which until then had really kept people out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3721">Q: So, this made a big different to your <span class="BUILDING">work</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3723">A: It made a tremendous difference because we could offer hope to many more people that they could get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3724">They didn't have to have visas -- I beg your pardon -- they didn't have to have affidavits from relatives.</sentence><sentence id="3725">Many of them didn't have relatives who wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3726">This also was important.</sentence><sentence id="3727">It meant that people were given a choice to an extent and how often had these people been given a choice after the war?They came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or if they were Polish Jews who had fled into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span>, and had gone back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, what choices had they had?</sentence><sentence id="3728">It might interest you, by the way, to know that among the people we took care of, the first complete Jewish families I found after the war were the Polish Jews who had fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> when the Germans marched in.</sentence><sentence id="3729">And, although they'd suffered tremendous hardship, we had husbands and wives and children together.</sentence><sentence id="3730">It was very interesting to see this.</sentence><sentence id="3731">As I said, they had -- many of them had suffered.</sentence><sentence id="3732">They'd worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span>, and when do Jews work in <span class="DLF">mines</span>, after all?</sentence><sentence id="3733">They were tradesmen or employees, but they did survive as families.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3748">A: No, it wasn't -- people weren't even aware.</sentence><sentence id="3749">People were concerned for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="3750">You have to try and imagine what it was like to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war when either you were a survivor of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> and there weren't too many remember -- you were somebody who had been encouraged to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, firstly because the Poles were still anti- Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="3751">There had been pogroms in 1946 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span>, when Jews were killed again.</sentence><sentence id="3752">You were encouraged to leave because you hoped for a better life somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="3753">You didn't want to be among the people you had been with, and everybody in a sense was concerned for himself or herself.</sentence><sentence id="3754">And you have to imagine also in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> there was a total lack of privacy for people.</sentence><sentence id="3755">They were sleeping in <span class="BUILDING">nissen</span> (ph) <span class="BUILDING">huts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3756">There was curtain in 8 between families to give them some sort of privacy, but very little because it didn't stop voices carrying.</sentence><sentence id="3757">It was a very difficult time for these people, and our feeling generally was the sooner we got them out of these -- these people out of these conditions, the better.</sentence><sentence id="3758">It was a very, very tough time for these people.</sentence><sentence id="3759">And although visitors who came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- and there were many -- and saw these people and they would talk very bravely, they didn't see how these people were living, what kind of latrine facilities there were, what kind of washing facilities there were.</sentence><sentence id="3760">There were no, obviously, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machines</span>, but what kind of laundry facilities there were, what kind of facilities there were for the Orthodox Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3761">It was an extraordinary difficult period, and these people survived it.</sentence><sentence id="3762">These are the people who were the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="3763">They were amazing people, and if there were occasionally arguments or quarrels, why not?</sentence><sentence id="3764">I mean, this too was normal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3782">Q: So, people who visited did not see the conditions in terms of which people-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3784">A: Oh, yes, they saw the conditions.</sentence><sentence id="3785">I'm thinking of people who visited who were interested, let's say, in raising money in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and they came through and they saw the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3786">They may have even spent as much as a half a day, but you can't get a feel of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> from that kind of experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3806">A: He was an interesting character.</sentence><sentence id="3807">Again, Dr. Joseph Schwartz, who was the European Director of the JDC, came to me and told me really a fantastic story of a man whom a whole group of survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> had just given a banquet.</sentence><sentence id="3808">Who was this man?</sentence><sentence id="3809">His name was Oscar Schindler, and I really knew nothing about him at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3810">And Dr. Schwartz told me that Oscar Schindler had saved the lives of at least 1,200 Jews by having them work in his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and Oscar Schindler had come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3811">I think he had tried to set up a <span class="BUILDING">concrete factory</span>, and was not successful.</sentence><sentence id="3812">It's interesting, this fantastic character didn't do very well.</sentence><sentence id="3813">The Joint was helping to support him at this time because they were so astounded by his efforts to save people who essentially were not of his own kind.</sentence><sentence id="3814">They were Jews; he was a Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="3815">He was a 9 member of the Nazi party, as most Germans were.</sentence><sentence id="3816">And the fact that he had helped these people, they were ready to do anything they could to help him.</sentence><sentence id="3817">So, Dr. Schwartz said to me, "Amy, you know the ropes.</sentence><sentence id="3818">He will come to you.</sentence><sentence id="3819">Perhaps he won't even come alone.</sentence><sentence id="3820">He may come with other <span class="NPIP">people</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3821">I want you to try and send him wherever he wants to go."</sentence><sentence id="3822">Well, Oscar Schindler appeared in my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> one day with his wife and two young Jewish couples, and I sort of couldn't get the hang of what the relationship was, and they explained to me in Yiddish that they always protected him because he looked like any other German Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="3823">He had blue eyes and blonde hair, and was very fair, obviously, and they were afraid if he came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, which was in the Jewish quarter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, he might be set upon.</sentence><sentence id="3824">There were a lot of belligerent Jews at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3825">Oscar, as I said, came, and explained to me that what he really wanted to do was to set up a <span class="DLF">mink farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3826">Now, what he knew about mink farming, I had no idea, but it wasn't mine to question.</sentence><sentence id="3827">And the place he wanted to do it was in the Argentine.</sentence><sentence id="3828">The Argentine, I knew the Argentine consuls.</sentence><sentence id="3829">I could get a visa for Oscar and his wife, no problem.</sentence><sentence id="3830">They were Catholics.</sentence><sentence id="3831">But, he said also, he would not go unless the two couples with him also got visas because they were like family to him, and they felt he was family to them.</sentence><sentence id="3832">He'd saved their lives, and they were never going to forget this.</sentence><sentence id="3833">Well, I set about trying to get the visas.</sentence><sentence id="3834">As I say, it was not too difficult for Oscar and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="3835">How to get visas for the two couples with him -- on the application form for a Argentine visa, they asked religion.</sentence><sentence id="3836">They did on many applications at that time, asked the religion of the applicant, but it didn't say explain anything.</sentence><sentence id="3837">It didn't say, for example, if somebody was Orthodox, were they Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Jewish Orthodox, "A ha!"</sentence><sentence id="3838">I thought.</sentence><sentence id="3839">I put Orthodox, and it was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="3840">I got the visas, and eventually they went to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3841">I'm sorry, they went to the Argentine, but they were lovely people, all of them.</sentence><sentence id="3842">Oscar was very soft voiced, very pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="3843">Who could imagine that this man -- he was diminutive, he wasn't very tall -- had the courage to do the kinds of things he did?</sentence><sentence id="3844">I don't know if you've seen the film "Schindler's List", but a lot of that -- the story in that film -- is true.</sentence><sentence id="3845">He was an extraordinary man to deal with, and in retrospect, quite a privilege to have met him.</sentence><sentence id="3846">It was interesting that we were so busy trying to help people that it never occurred to me that here was somebody who was very, very special.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3888">Q: Did you talk with his wife, as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3890">A: Yes, she didn't do much talking, but she also was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="3891">She's still alive, you know, living in the Argentine.</sentence><sentence id="3892">She was very pleasant, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3896">Q: Did he -- did you talk to him at all about what he had done during the war, or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3898">A: No, you didn't talk to people.</sentence><sentence id="3899">I think, firstly, he might have been embarrassed, but that isn't why he came to see me.</sentence><sentence id="3900">Firstly, it would not have occurred to me, except to tell him what a wonderful human being he was, but you know, we really had no concept at that time -- this is 1949 -- of the kinds of things that he had done to save so many people.</sentence><sentence id="3901">I mean, he got people out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3902">Who ever got anybody out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3903">He was quite an extraordinary man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3912">Q: Could you put together the man who was portrayed in the film and the man that you met in your <span class="BUILDING">office</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3914">A: Yes, to an extent.</sentence><sentence id="3915">I think there's one part of the film where he goes into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to get wine, I think, it is Gert's <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and the young lady who works for him, a Jewish prisoner, who Gert is very nasty to, is down there and Oscar, if you remember the film, leans towards her and she thinks he's going to kiss her.</sentence><sentence id="3916">And he pats her on the shoulder.</sentence><sentence id="3917">He said, "No, I wasn't going to kiss you.</sentence><sentence id="3918">I was going to kiss you actually only on the forehead, but to tell you you will be all right.</sentence><sentence id="3919">I will take care of you."</sentence><sentence id="3920">Now, when you think of this man, he could've abused this girl.</sentence><sentence id="3921">He could've abused any of the Jewish women in his care.</sentence><sentence id="3922">He could've raped them if he had to.</sentence><sentence id="3923">He could've done anything with them because they owed their lives to him.</sentence><sentence id="3924">He didn't touch one of them.</sentence><sentence id="3925">Although in the film, he is shown as being a womanizer, it helps to sell a film.</sentence><sentence id="3926">Let's face it, and he may have been a womanizer, but the important thing about Oscar Schindler is he didn't touch one of the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="3927">I think this tells you essentially the character of this man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3942">Q: So, how long did it take you to get him the visa? (</sentence><sentence id="3943">One second, please.) [</sentence><sentence id="3944">Microphone adjusted.]</sentence><sentence id="3945">How long did take you to get him out of <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3946">Or get him into <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, I'm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3952">A: I think it took me about five or six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="3953">There are all kinds of documents you have to fill in.</sentence><sentence id="3954">You have to get passports.</sentence><sentence id="3955">I had to get passports, take those passports for the people who were going with him.</sentence><sentence id="3956">They were Polish Jews, and they weren't going as Polish citizens.</sentence><sentence id="3957">It was all rather complicated, and yet in a sense it was very normal for us to be doing the kind of thing we were doing.</sentence><sentence id="3958">So, he came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on several occasions, and was always very pleasant, an extraordinary man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3966">Q: Could we stop the film for just one second?

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3976">A: There were some very wonderful survivors, but each story is a different story.</sentence><sentence id="3977">The fact that they were survivors, and remained decent human beings and people with a sense of humor, and people with kindness, there are many stories of many kind people, and there were people who survived who weren't kind people.</sentence><sentence id="3978">I think people went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> -- rather, people who went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> as kind, decent human beings came out as such, and those who were gaslonim, gangsters, when they went in, were gangsters when they came out.</sentence><sentence id="3979">People don't change.</sentence><sentence id="3980">Their behavior changes, I think.</sentence><sentence id="3981">There was some very wonderful people who survived, and very wonderful people, unfortunately, who didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3988">Q: So, how -- you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> doing this job until 1952.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3992">A: I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until the Displaced Persons Act came to an end, and then I felt it was time for me to go on.</sentence><sentence id="3993">The American Joint wanted me to go down to <span class="COUNTRY">Morocco</span> where they had a program, but I thought it was about time I started to sample normal life.</sentence><sentence id="3994">You have to remember that, since I was a teenager, I'd been working with displaced persons living an expatriate life, an exotic life in a way, but I felt that my biggest job had been done.</sentence><sentence id="3995">I'd helped as many people as I could to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3996">We didn't handle <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3997">And it was about time I set myself up.</sentence><sentence id="3998">And, so, I waited until the Act came to an end in May of *45, and then decided I would go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and see where some of these Americans with whom I'd work came from.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4050">A: Well, I couldn't see myself in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> having worked with the Americans for so long.</sentence><sentence id="4051">I needed a break, I felt.</sentence><sentence id="4052">I had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, anyway, and I thought I would come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4053">I had friends in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, Gladys Roth, with whom I had worked invited me also to come and stay with her while she was on leave, and so I thought that was a good idea.</sentence><sentence id="4054">And, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> I was invited by William Rosenwald, the son of Julius -- was it Julius Rosenwald.</sentence><sentence id="4055">Or was that his brother who started <span class="BUILDING">Sears Roebuck</span>? --</sentence><sentence id="4056">who had met me in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, asked me if I'd come and run his philanthropies for him, and I thought I would try that.</sentence><sentence id="4057">And I was working for him for about a year when the American Joint again approached me and said they had a problem down in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> where the last people who had been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span>, a lot of whom had been sent down there and they were having a problem.</sentence><sentence id="4058">Would I go down to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and sort the situation out?</sentence><sentence id="4059">Foolishly, I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="4060">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brazilian community</span> that I dealt with, largely was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4061">There were about 20,000 former refugees living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Paulo</span>, most of them very, very fine people.</sentence><sentence id="4062">The people who had been sent in when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span> were closing were difficult people, let me put it that way.</sentence><sentence id="4063">Some of them were mentally ill.</sentence><sentence id="4064">Some of them should never have been sent.</sentence><sentence id="4065">Some of them had no desire to be there.</sentence><sentence id="4066">It was a very, very difficult situation.</sentence><sentence id="4067">I was physically attacked down there for a change.</sentence><sentence id="4068">I hadn't been physically attacked since I'd been in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and it was broadcast, by the way, over the radio and some friends, including Norman Bentwich, Professor Bentwich, heard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, called my aunt, and I got frantic phone calls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4069">I got another dislocation from that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4090">Q: How did they attack you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4092">A: Physically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4094">Q: They just started beating you up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4096">A: Well, they tried, yes, and you know, I'm rather small.</sentence><sentence id="4097">I'm only five foot four, and these guys were big guys, and I'm not a fighter, physically or mentally, I think, but after that I worked under police protection.</sentence><sentence id="4098">And I used to come back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in which I lived under police protection, and one of the very nice Swedish boys at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> asked me, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="4099">Because apparently the only other women who came back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> under police protection where the prostitutes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4104">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4106">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4107">No, I had to explain to him that I'd been attacked, you know.</sentence><sentence id="4108">But, the community that was established there, there was a Dr. Lorch, L-o-r-c-h, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, his wife who's actually Brazilian Jewish -- she was a Klabin, of the Klabin family.</sentence><sentence id="4109">The parents had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> at the turn of the century from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, and they were a very, very wealthy family, and very concerned for refugees.</sentence><sentence id="4110">They had worked on the refugees committee before the war, and they helped after the war.</sentence><sentence id="4111">They were very kind to me, and there were several other families who did a beautiful job down there, but these people 3 were people they hadn't met before.</sentence><sentence id="4112">I hadn't met this kind before, actually.</sentence><sentence id="4113">I set up a small loans committee to try and help them.</sentence><sentence id="4114">Their visas weren't regular visas, you know, it's coming back to the old story, and I had to legalize them, and the Brazilian government really didn't want to legalize them except for Jeiko (ph).</sentence><sentence id="4115">Yes, and it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="4116">Eventually, the government settled.</sentence><sentence id="4117">I must say, and I'll confess now that one or two who were Germans who didn't know what they were letting themselves in for I sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4118">One or two of them, I managed to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4119">And we set up a small loans committee so that a lot of these men could become hawkers.</sentence><sentence id="4120">They bought goods on credit, and went to outlying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> just as the original Strausses did in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4121">Some of them became very wealthy, and they calmed down.</sentence><sentence id="4122">Some of them were pretty awful people, and as with all groups, there was lovely people among them.</sentence><sentence id="4123">It was a very tough job.</sentence><sentence id="4124">I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> for nine months.</sentence><sentence id="4125">It was a tough assignment, a very tough assignment.</sentence><sentence id="4126">When I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and the British asked me -- called me and said would I come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4127">Because the British government was now allowing what they called hardcore cases to come into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4128">Hardcore cases for the British were families where the head of the family could not maintain his family either because of physical illness or even that they might be mentally disturbed, and so I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and went into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> again to choose hardcore cases to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4129">They were interesting, some of these people.</sentence><sentence id="4130">I had one young man who had been shot through the shoulder and had no profession.</sentence><sentence id="4131">We brought him to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4132">He was supposed to have had TB and be cured, but when we got him to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, we discovered he still had TB, and the British were not really taking in TB cases.</sentence><sentence id="4133">They had enough illnesses of their own, and so eventually, I took this man who behaved as though he were mentally ill while he was <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, eventually I took him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4134">We flew, and it was quite surprising.</sentence><sentence id="4135">As we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, you never would have known that he had behavior other than normal behavior.</sentence><sentence id="4136">When they x- rayed him, he showed no signs of TB.</sentence><sentence id="4137">I'm sure they thought the British were trying to get rid of him.</sentence><sentence id="4138">He was quite an extraordinary case.</sentence><sentence id="4139">I think he couldn't face being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="REGION">territory</span> in which he was captured.</sentence><sentence id="4140">He was one of the strange cases.</sentence><sentence id="4141">Others were families with several sons and daughters.</sentence><sentence id="4142">Some of them Orthodox Jews who made a very good adjustment to living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4143">We moved them into <span class="REGION">areas</span> where there were Orthodox Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4144">The Jewish Refugees Committee did a very good job on those people, and I remember another young -- not a young couple, but a young man with older parents who the British brought in, and had him trained as a surveyor.</sentence><sentence id="4145">He had no college education, but like many people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, you could go into a profession and train on the job, and he did very well and his parents adjusted very well.</sentence><sentence id="4146">Those families on the whole, except for this young man, who was very sad, were a success.</sentence><sentence id="4147">And then, of course, I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4148">I became, I suppose, a cosmopolitan in a way in that I felt at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="4149">I'd worked for so long with displaced persons, in a sense, it was the only thing I knew.</sentence><sentence id="4150">But after coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, one of my friends convinced me I ought to work with the National Council of Jewish Women, their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4151">And I went to see them, and I must say they were very anxious to get me.</sentence><sentence id="4152">I don't know why, perhaps my experience meant something to them.</sentence><sentence id="4153">And I did work for them for -- I'm trying to think how long -- several years, until the wanderlust got me again, and I decided together with a 4 friend who was a published author that we'd go off to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and see what the role of women was in the new <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4154">I didn't realize we wouldn't get visas, but I gave up my job.</sentence><sentence id="4155">My friend got an advance on a book about <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4156">She was already, as I say, a published author, and we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> -- or rather, I landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4157">She was coming later by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4158">I flew in.</sentence><sentence id="4159">And the first night that I was in the Frank Lloyd Wright Imperial Hotel, it was a very interesting <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4160">Everything was much too big for me.</sentence><sentence id="4161">Everything was high, and the first night I was there, I met charming gentleman in the <span class="BUILDING">smorgasbord restaurant</span> who eventually became my husband.</sentence><sentence id="4162">We got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> because my family couldn't think that somebody hat at last got me to say yes, and I ended up on the prairie in <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>, on the flat, flat prairie, which I found devastating, absolutely devastating.</sentence><sentence id="4163">Nobody knew me.</sentence><sentence id="4164">Nobody knew of the work that I had done.</sentence><sentence id="4165">Nobody was interested, and I decided, "Well, if I'm going to be stuck here" because David was a lovely, lovely man, "I'm going to do something.</sentence><sentence id="4166">I'Il go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>," which I had tried to do before I left <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4167">I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in the evening, but of course couldn't continue because of the Blitz and things like that, and then I went overseas.</sentence><sentence id="4168">I said to myself, "I'll get my degree here."</sentence><sentence id="4169">And in the time it normally takes a student not having been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a thousand years, I maintain a straight average -- a straight-A average -- got my undergraduate degree, got a Master's degree, and then decided I would do what I always want to do and that was to get a PhD at the London School of Economics, and David thought that was a splendid idea.</sentence><sentence id="4170">He was very kind, and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="4171">The semester was ten weeks.</sentence><sentence id="4172">We had three <span class="BUILDING">semesters</span> a year, and I had to be there for two years.</sentence><sentence id="4173">I managed to skip one while we went on sabbatical to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, which is another story, meeting people I'd sent there as refugees, and came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, finished my dissertation, and in 1975, received my PhD from the London School of Economics.</sentence><sentence id="4174">And then I decided what one really had to do was to tell this story of what happened during and after the war because, as I say, nobody ever asked.</sentence><sentence id="4175">Nobody seemed to be interested.</sentence><sentence id="4176">There was one professor at <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4177">His name was Winton Solberg.</sentence><sentence id="4178">He was an intellectual history, and he asked me to write a course on the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4179">I thought this was going to be a great opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="4180">I wrote the course, but I was a woman, and the history department wasn't about to make funding available for me to teach the course.</sentence><sentence id="4181">But, women's movement was beginning to get going, and Joan Huber, who was head of the department of sociology, said to me, "Amy, you can teach that course in our department."</sentence><sentence id="4182">I have to go back and bit and tell you that I had competed for a job as an assistant to the vice president for academic affairs for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and there were two positions going.</sentence><sentence id="4183">There were 77 applicants, and Edith Terwilliger and I got those positions.</sentence><sentence id="4184">The former Vice President, P.T. Yankwich, now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="4185">So, it was very interesting working for this man.</sentence><sentence id="4186">He was very bright.</sentence><sentence id="4187">He was an intellectual, and he gave me time off to teach the course, and since I got paid for teaching the course, it meant I could employ a graduate assistant and pay her that money, so she had money during the semester.</sentence><sentence id="4188">I gave the course over three or four <span class="BUILDING">semesters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4189">It was fascinating because the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which I was assigned filled very quickly, and the computer cut us off, and I found that the students taking the course were children from all ends, or both ends, of the Jewish spectrum.</sentence><sentence id="4190">They were children of strictly Orthodox parents, and children of non-Orthodox parents.</sentence><sentence id="4191">They were children of survivors.</sentence><sentence id="4192">They 5 were children of Polish immigrants who'd come after the war, and one didn't know what their parents had done during the war, and all of them were interesting because, if I told them, for example, the story of a pastor who had saved some Jews, they wanted proof, and my xeroxing bill was tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="4193">I always brought evidence of anything I told them that was positive about non-Jews who'd helped Jews, and I used to say, "There were good Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4194">There were good Poles.</sentence><sentence id="4195">There just weren't enough of them."</sentence><sentence id="4196">They were interesting groups of students because, as I discovered, those whose parents were survivors, they told me their parents told them nothing.</sentence><sentence id="4197">And I would tell them, "Perhaps you can tell them something of what you've learned in the class and see what their reaction is.</sentence><sentence id="4198">Don't push them, but gently try to get their stories from them because it is still so painful for them -- for them to tell you these stories."</sentence><sentence id="4199">They were very interesting students, and I kept in touch with them for a long time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4294">Q: Did they ask you -- did you tell them about what you had done after the war or did you not tell them anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4296">A: I didn't tell them essentially, but I would -- I think my classes were interesting because I would tell them incidents of my experience.</sentence><sentence id="4297">I didn't tell them in the sense that I've told you, but I would tell them of incidents and that I knew of these incidents because of this experience.</sentence><sentence id="4298">I think they believed me because they felt that I was talking from experience, so they enjoyed taking my course.</sentence><sentence id="4299">I made it a difficult course.</sentence><sentence id="4300">When I say I made it a difficult course, I didn't make it easy because of my experience.</sentence><sentence id="4301">They had to pass the grade, too, but no, I didn't tell them because I -- just like with Oscar Schindler, I didn't think people were interested, and also, I find it very hard to talk about myself.</sentence><sentence id="4302">I might tell you this is the first time I've ever done it.</sentence><sentence id="4303">Nobody has ever asked me before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4312">Q: Well, I'm really grateful, and so is everybody else who is hearing this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4314">A: Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4316">Q: Amy, you were asked to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to create an archive.</sentence><sentence id="4317">Can you talk about that, and talk about one of the pieces of information that you had found that really had been lost about the St. Louis?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4320">A: Oh, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4322">Q: Can you do that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4324">A: My pleasure.</sentence><sentence id="4325">After my husband died, the head of the World Jewish Fund for Jewish Relief, no sorry, got the name wrong, haven't I?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4328">Q: British Fund- 6</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4330">A: Central British Fund for World Jewish Relief called me one day because she knew of my relationship to the organization.</sentence><sentence id="4331">She said they had found a tremendous stack of files in one of the <span class="BUILDING">garages</span> at one of the <span class="BUILDING">nursing homes</span>, rather, one of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for the aged for former refugees.</sentence><sentence id="4332">Would I come and look at it?</sentence><sentence id="4333">She knew that I came into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> fairly often because I did have brothers and sisters there.</sentence><sentence id="4334">And so I came and looked at the stack and was amazed.</sentence><sentence id="4335">There were a tremendous number of case histories on individuals.</sentence><sentence id="4336">They were files on children who'd been brought out from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on kinder <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4337">There were minutes of meetings.</sentence><sentence id="4338">And I said to this woman, Ava Mitchell, "You have a treasure trove here.</sentence><sentence id="4339">You've got the archives of your <span class="BUILDING">agency</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4340">Nobody knows their story."</sentence><sentence id="4341">And she originally had been a refugee, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="4342">She said, "Would you put it together for us?"</sentence><sentence id="4343">Well, I wasn't an archivist, and I knew that the agency would never have the money to employ an archivist.</sentence><sentence id="4344">We have to remember that after the war, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was still very poor.</sentence><sentence id="4345">I said I thought I'd like to do this.</sentence><sentence id="4346">So, I packed my bags and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4347">They gave me a staff.</sentence><sentence id="4348">Somebody had given them some money so that we can work on this archive, and Bill &amp; Howe (ph) did our microfilming for us.</sentence><sentence id="4349">They were very helpful, and they asked me to do a booklet on the archive, which I did which was published which was rather nice.</sentence><sentence id="4350">It took us about 18 months to put this stuff together, but it has proved invaluable.</sentence><sentence id="4351">For example, one of the items we found were all the records of people who had ever registered with the Jewish Refugees Committee from 1933 on, and that would be from May the 18", 1933, when the organization was started.</sentence><sentence id="4352">It would have records of people who'd been inquired about and you would find a card which would say, "Helen Comb -- deported through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiresenstadt</span> (ph)" And it would give the date because somebody had come in and given this information.</sentence><sentence id="4353">And, even to this day, those cards are useful.</sentence><sentence id="4354">For example, if you want to prove that you came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a refugee, and claim your pension or money from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or some funding which was due to you, we could look up your archive and see if your name was there, and it would give the date that you arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4355">Now, what happened ultimately, as we were working through this archive, I began to see names which said "St. Louis", and that struck me because I knew of the story of the St. Louis, this ghastly story of these people who in high hopes went in party fashion, practically, to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>, not knowing that they were going to be refused entry, not knowing that all but about 22 would be refused entry because the 22 had paid the extra money that was required to get a permanent visa.</sentence><sentence id="4356">And I start to make cards on them, and I found about 110 of the people who came into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where it was marked St. Louis passengers, and I kept these cards.</sentence><sentence id="4357">And then one day I heard from the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, your <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, that you were going to do an exhibition on the people who sailed on the St. Louis and the face of those who landed up in Europe, but you really didn't have full records of those who landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, although you had names.</sentence><sentence id="4358">And I said, "If you give me all the names, I will be able to trace all of them.</sentence><sentence id="4359">And I must say it took me quite a while, I won't tell you how many weeks, to go through these -- the microfilm, find these people, and take a picture of these people, and I found all 187 of the people who landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, and I felt very pleased because it will help complete your archive, and it shows the value of doing what we did and the money we spent on putting that archive together.</sentence><sentence id="4360">Archives are terribly, terribly important, and I only hope that people who may look at this film will realize if they have letters from people during 7 the war, before the war, after the war, which might be useful, to find out from an archivist where they might be useful.</sentence><sentence id="4361">The family might not be interested, but an archive will be able to put history together, and without our history we have no future.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4394">Q: Well, Amy Gottlieb, it's been a real pleasure talking to you.</sentence><sentence id="4395">Your book, "Men of Vision" is something people should read if they want to know about what <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> did, and the stories that you tell is particularly poignant now when we have 50-80 million refugees in the world, and how difficult it is, and how much care it takes.</sentence><sentence id="4396">And the care that you've given these people, I'm sure they all thank you, and we thank you for being here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4400">A: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="4401">And I must say that there are volunteers today from many countries of the world helping refugees <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4402">I only hope they get the kind of the care that the British gave to the refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> before the war and during the war, and after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4406">Q: Yes, this history must be a repetition for you over and over again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4408">A: Yes, you see the same kind of things happening that happened before.</sentence><sentence id="4409">If I were younger, I would go out and help.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4412">Q: I'm sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4414">A: Thank you for inviting me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4416">Q: Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4418">A: [Badge shown.]</sentence><sentence id="4419">The badge that you see was given to all members of Jewish Relief Units who volunteered to go overseas during and after the war.</sentence><sentence id="4420">For example, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> was liberated, more than a 100 people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- doctors, nurses, lawyers, social workers, teachers, went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> to help those people who had survived there.</sentence><sentence id="4421">This was the badge that the Central British Fund had set up for us so that we would be recognized as a Jewish team, so that survivors who saw the Shield of David would realize that we were Jews who had come to help them, and perhaps ease their burden somewhat.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4426">Q: And where did you wear this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4428">A: We wore this badge on the beret that we had.</sentence><sentence id="4429">We also wore a Shield of David in blue and white on our sleeves as our insignia.</sentence><sentence id="4430">And we wore a British Army uniform at the time, British army officer's uniform, actually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
