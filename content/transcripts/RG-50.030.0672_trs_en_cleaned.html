had to be open because we had another soldier there walking up and down the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> with a weapon.</sentence><sentence id="640">So, and that <span class="DLF">door</span> had to be open.</sentence><sentence id="641">So, finally, he asked for another towel, and he got it.</sentence><sentence id="642">And he, instead of taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, he took a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="643">And that's the only reaction I had with him.</sentence><sentence id="644">But I was on his <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> a

their IDs.</sentence><sentence id="666">And we had to see them around.</sentence><sentence id="667">We had to know them.</sentence><sentence id="668">And we also, then later on, we would out to,

only one guard there.</sentence><sentence id="676">One guard.</sentence><sentence id="677">And the witnesses were allowed to walk in and out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>, you know, and mingle.</sentence><sentence id="678">But at 10 o'clock, they had to be in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>, you know, time to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="679">And I'll never forget this.</sentence><sentence id="680">My job was, I was there on a New Year's Eve.</sentence><sentence id="681">It must have been "45, 1945 New Year's Eve.</sentence><sentence id="682">And the, there was women, she was in charge, like, a lieutenant, and here she said she was going to leave early because she's going to a party.</sentence><sentence id="683">And, you know, once they get in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>, they'll be okay.</sentence><sentence id="684">And here, throughout our, throughout the, you know, our ranks and throughout the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, there was a story about one of these women, they wore, she wore riding clothes.</sentence><sentence id="685">And what she would do, and I don't know if I should tell you this.</sentence><sentence id="686">This was what, the word was out that she would strip, and you'd give her a candy bar or something.</sentence><sentence id="687">You know, and then she would report the time, you know, the

couple times.</sentence><sentence id="695">And I finally had to tell her that she had to stay in her <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">And that's the last I seen of her.</sentence><sentence id="697">And that's, that's about it.</sentence><sentence id="698">And everything else was routine.</sentence><sentence id="699">Oh, we had another post.</sentence><sentence

empty.</sentence><sentence id="702">They just had one guard in there.</sentence><sentence id="703">And all he had to do is make sure nobody got in there.</sentence><sentence id="704">And I just really had to just walk around in there for two hours.</sentence><sentence id="705">And that's all I did.</sentence><sentence id="706">I was just amazed at the, you know, how small it was because all those people were in it.</sentence><sentence id="707">And you know, I looked at there, and I seen this one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="708">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stenotype machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">I remember I was really fascinated with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">And then,

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="880">A: Well, the prisoners were, only time they were together was when they went out for their exercise.</sentence><sentence id="881">We had an <span class="DLF">exercise yard</span>, they call it.</sentence><sentence id="882">And at first, we took all 20 of them out together.</sentence><sentence id="883">And whatever guard, and our, the guards just stood around the <span class="DLF">exercise yard</span> and watching your prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="884">And as the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, as the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was going on, you know, the proceedings were going on, we noticed that we were just given so many prisoners go out, not all together.</sentence><sentence id="885">Like, maybe 18 or 15, you know.</sentence><sentence id="886">And that was because, I think they were, somebody said they were, you know, talking about the other prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="887">They were against them.</sentence><sentence id="888">And they became enemies.</sentence><sentence id="889">So they wouldn't take, send them out together.</sentence><sentence id="890">And I just remember how it started at the beginning with all 20 was out.</sentence><sentence id="891">Then, there was like 17.</sentence><sentence id="892">Then, it would, I can remember one time, we only had maybe ten of them out</sentence><sentence id="894">there.</sentence><sentence id="895">But, and they said that's because in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>, they were blaming each other.</sentence><sentence id="896">So, that's all I know about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="916">Q: Did you notice anything about their behavior, either when they were in their <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> or <span class="NPIP">outside</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="976">Q: You've said a couple of times that you were, you were afraid at certain points.</sentence><sentence id="977">Was that because it was a new situation, or were you afraid of the actual process of guarding them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
