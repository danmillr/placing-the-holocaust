<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2">My mother was very angry, but my father and I, we always had some kind of an understanding.</sentence><sentence id="3">Even when he scolded me for something that, that had something to do with religion to go along with my mother, I sensed in his voice that it was not serious, that he just did it for my mother's sake.</sentence><sentence id="4">And I also found out since, between 1948 and 1950, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> which we will come back later, when I came back and I spoke Hebrew, I realize that my father doesn't know how to pray, that he just mumbles the words.</sentence><sentence id="5">He has no idea, what really, how to even pronounce them and he did this all for, for the love of my, my, my mother and I appreciated this, that he put up this pretense but it was an interesting discovery for me, that.</sentence><sentence id="6">So he never, he never really scolded me and he was practically influential after the war to put down his foot and say, forget about kosher anymore, let's just eat what is available.</sentence><sentence id="7">And so we did not have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher household</span> anymore.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Now was your father's entire family not very religious, then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Yes, yes, they weren't.</sentence><sentence id="18">They were Jews, they never, they never doubt their Jewishness.</sentence><sentence id="19">They knew they were Jews but they were secular Jews, you know?</sentence><sentence id="20">And interestingly, quite a few of them survived because of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they lived.</sentence><sentence id="21">Since they lived in a Proletarian tenement of--city tenement--that was given to people under a certain income who had too many children and not enough income, there, the Communist Party, the illegal Communist Party had a very strong hold on this <span class="REGION">area</span> and when, then, the World War II came and the Nuremburg laws and everything else, some of these Communist leaders, Communist members, came and actually rescued members of the family.</sentence><sentence id="22">I have an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and he, for example, was a very good friend of a past Communist prime minister who just died recently because they practically lived side by side.</sentence><sentence id="23">So a great deal of the Hungarian leadership, Communist leadership, came from this tenement.</sentence><sentence id="24">So that helped rescue them.</sentence><sentence id="25">The Communists were the only, the only group you could really turn to, during those terrible years that, that would help you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="35">Q: So, was religion mainly only recognized in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> on holidays, or. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="38">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="39">My, my father always talked to me and said go, you know, to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, your mother wants you to go and all this and that, but he never really did anything to force me to do whatever with religion.</sentence><sentence id="40">He just asked me to respect my mother's wishes and so I had Bar Mitzvah and that was the last thing that I did.</sentence><sentence id="41">After my Bar Mitzvah I never probably went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> again unless it was a tourist attraction, I just, wanted to see what it is, <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">And, but I never denied my Jewishness so when my grandchildren especially ask me about religion, I say Iam a Jew but I'm not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="43">And they ask me, "How can that be?"</sentence><sentence id="44">And I said, "Well, it's easy."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: Did you have any sort of, any sense of faith?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: No, not really.</sentence><sentence id="56">It's a strange thing that I have never been somebody who believes in the supreme being and so maybe, eventually, my lot, this is going to be difficult, but because they say people who have faith, they die much easier than the ones who don't, but I always</sentence><sentence id="58">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 4 just associated with people who practically felt the same way and it never caused any problems so far in my life, in my sixty-six years.</sentence><sentence id="59">But I can't remember when I really honestly believed in a supreme being.</sentence><sentence id="60">And then of course, the war probably wiped out, if I had any doubts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: Will you say something about your relationship with your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: My relationship with my father was always very good.</sentence><sentence id="71">I [indecipherable], I considered him always my, my example, my hero, and I was very very upset when in 1942, he was taken away and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">And when he came back in 1945, he, of course, I was overwhelmed and in my memory too, even though I spent more time with my mother, a lot more than with my father because he was also a traveling salesman for a long time and I only saw him on weekends, somehow my memory is much more blurred when it comes to my mother than when it comes to my father.</sentence><sentence id="73">My mother, one reason it might be that my mother died in 1970 and my father died in 1980, so he survived ten more years and since we lived in Europe from "74 on, at least for six years I had a lot more contact with him than I would have if I had stayed in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> I always considered him an absolute statue of integrity and, and honesty and he was always looking out for my interests and I, even though when I as an American, had a very nice living, I made a very nice living and I didn't need any, any material, he was still saving and collecting things for us in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and was always giving us a lot of things when we went to visit him and we kept telling him that he should spend it on himself.</sentence><sentence id="74">He, he was just one of the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: And you felt this way from the time that you were a small child...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: Yes, always, always.</sentence><sentence id="83">He was always that way.</sentence><sentence id="84">Just a very simple, very simple man.</sentence><sentence id="85">Very, extremely intelligent, uneducated but a true human being.</sentence><sentence id="86">And with my mother, I always had a little bit of my doubts that she's not as straightforward as my father.</sentence><sentence id="87">And there were little incidents that kind of, as a child, it's amazing how it gets engraved in your mind and you cannot get rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="88">And the thing that I was very, very bitter about, that I could never forgive my mother for, was that while my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, she took a little job and she worked for a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">And next to the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> was an <span class="BUILDING">antique store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">Mr. Klein was the name of the man who owned and he liked my mother.</sentence><sentence id="91">My mother was a cute little creature and everybody liked her and so he would wait for her when she closed this <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to escort her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he lived the same way and I didn't see anything wrong with this, but they noticed how jealous I am of my mother and it's not that I wanted to possess my mother, I just, | was protecting my mother for my father and so he put his arm around my mother and they were looking at me and laughing at how annoyed I became and this picture is constantly in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="92">And I could never forgive my mother for this, that, that she did not realize how hurt I was by playing this silly game.</sentence><sentence id="93">And she was, still she was a good person, she did everything possible to give me a good education and, but, she had a very petit-bourgeois thinking and another thing that somehow stood between the two of us was piano.</sentence><sentence id="94">She decided that I'm going to be a great</sentence><sentence id="96">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 5 piano player and I decided that I have no interest in playing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and she would sometimes get so annoyed that I did not practice that she would take a rug-beater and run after me and try to beat me but I was much faster than she was so we were running around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and then eventually she just broke down and cried that she couldn't catch me but she had this obsession with, with, with piano playing and so again, ever since in World War II, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> was destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="97">We gave it to somebody for safekeeping and they claimed that the, the bomb got it, whatever, I was glad.</sentence><sentence id="98">She wanted to buy another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and I said no.</sentence><sentence id="99">When I, when we came up from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> after liberation, I said, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="100">I am now a man.</sentence><sentence id="101">I basically rescued my mother more than once during World War II and I said no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and I never sat down to play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">Never.</sentence><sentence id="103">I never had the urge.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: You talked a little bit about your relationship with your mother's family and I was interested in hearing your relationship with your father's family.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Yes, in fifth grade, the, the idea of art was for the art teacher to draw on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blackboard</span> and then for the rest of the class, class to copy it and color it.</sentence><sentence id="271">The, teacher came around and made sure that everybody's following his instructions and just to emphasize that he means business, he had a big cane in his hand and for some reason, I missed a couple of the colors and used something different.</sentence><sentence id="272">He became absolutely just, angry, unreasonably so and started to beat me to the point where I began to bleed through my nose.</sentence><sentence id="273">And I also became frantic seeing the blood coming from, from my nose and all this so I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">I mentioned before that I lived next to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">The other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was where we lived, <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">And I ran up to my mother's, into my mother's arms and asked her to clean me up and come and basically what I wanted is justice, I could not, even at the age of eleven, I couldn't believe that this is going to be the way it is.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I wanted her to come in and do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="278">And after she cleaned me up she said, "Now you must understand, a lot of things that you cannot understand now, I cannot go in and do anything, yes, except apologize for your behavior."</sentence><sentence id="279">And I said, "What, what behavior, what did I do, used the wrong color," and she said, "Well, you don't understand just now."

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: Okay, my father was taken away several times.</sentence><sentence id="464">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was kind of a strange part of that <span class="REGION">Nazi area</span> because the Hungarians, the Hungarian government has always been in the hands of the aristocracy, Hungarian aristocracy, and the Hungarian aristocracy had no taste for Jews but also had no taste for killing or murdering Jews.</sentence><sentence id="465">They were above this, and so therefore when the dictator of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, Admiral Horthy, had to appoint a government, most of the time that government would not eventually do everything that the Germans wanted them to do.</sentence><sentence id="466">So it was almost like playing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">musical chairs</span>, I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>'s a very small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and you don't have that many politicians, aristocrats to go around, but almost the same faces somehow appeared, if not as prime minister then maybe minister of interior, or something.</sentence><sentence id="467">So we really, up until 1944, we had a great deal of anti-Semitism, we had a great deal of persecution of Jews but we were not in fear of our lives.</sentence><sentence id="468">Because somehow that was below the dignity of that class.</sentence><sentence id="469">Not only that, some of those aristocrats were very Anglophiles and had, during the war, connections with the British.</sentence><sentence id="470">And so in between, it depended on which aristocrat was in charge of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="471">Some of them were a little bit more German-oriented than others.</sentence><sentence id="472">And when, and more German-oriented came into the picture because the Germans didn't like the one who was in <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, then he ordered that so and so is going to go and serve in, these Jews will be taken to the labor battalion.</sentence><sentence id="473">My father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor battalion</span> before he was taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> but he was inside <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> so we could visit him, we could take food for him and eventually, when a new prime minister came, he declared that anybody over let's say, forty-five can go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="474">So there was no fear of being killed just because you are, you're a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="475">Up until 1944, March, when the Germans marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="489">Q: So when your father was called to be taken away...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="491">A: To go, yeah, we knew where he was.</sentence><sentence id="492">I remember, he was not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> for awhile, for a few month, and then almost every weekend we took food down, we talked to him, he was released, we could walk around a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="493">And so it was not the same thing as taken away to a faraway <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where we had no idea what would happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="494">Now, there, there, then in 1942, he was taken away for, for good.</sentence><sentence id="495">For some reason, and I cannot really</sentence><sentence id="497">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 12 remember exactly what happened and why.</sentence><sentence id="498">We had, probably, a more radical prime minister who yielded to the Germans and let this contingent of Jewish labor battalions go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and he was then taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="499">I remember, even then, they, they were told which <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> are they going to be going through in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and they allowed them to be there I think half an hour or an hour where we had a visit with him so we could talk over a few things.</sentence><sentence id="500">And that was the last I saw him, then, for a couple of years until he came back after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="537">A: Well, of course we were always afraid that he would not survive and we had no doubt that physically he could survive but we were afraid that, that he would get killed.</sentence><sentence id="538">But an interesting episode was that, [cough] excuse me, I asked him after the war, what, why did he survive if so many people died?</sentence><sentence id="539">And he had a little, just a short little anecdote, he said, "Son, there were two kinds of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">We got a <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> of water every morning.</sentence><sentence id="541">The one group drank the water immediately and the second group, such as myself, drank half of the water during the day and we used the other half to wash ourselves."</sentence><sentence id="542">And I said, "Half a <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> of water would make you clean?"</sentence><sentence id="543">He said, "No, but I felt like a human being, I was still caring about myself."</sentence><sentence id="544">And he said, "And later on I understood a lot more about this whole attitude that I'm not going to lie down here and gulp down everything, I am, even though I am full of lice, I'm still caring about myself."</sentence><sentence id="545">So that, basically, that was the attitude that saved, I'm sure, that was who survived.</sentence><sentence id="546">And of course luck, because even with this attitude somebody could have shot you if they didn't like your face or the way they moved.</sentence><sentence id="547">Yes, we, my mother maintained of course like most wives that he's going to return, and she was right because even though we have not heard from him for a long time, especially the last year when he was there, of course by that time, we couldn't have heard from him because he was already in the liberated area and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> still, in the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span>.</sentence><sentence id="548">It was, however, just that, that deep feeling that he will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="549">And he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in 1945, I remember late spring, it must have been April, May, probably, and he did not just stop by and said, "Here I am."</sentence><sentence id="550">He was afraid that maybe we would faint or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="551">He sent a friend up.</sentence><sentence id="552">A man came up and inquired about my father and very slowly kind of asked, "When did you hear from him?"</sentence><sentence id="553">and all this, and "Do you think he's alive?"</sentence><sentence id="554">and all this, and slowly he said, "Well, I have a feeling that he is alive," and slowly he led us to this.</sentence><sentence id="555">I remember him coming up on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> with a rucksack.</sentence><sentence id="556">The rucksack was full of sausage and potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="557">And he knew that we were starving and so that was it.</sentence><sentence id="558">Now, just to describe the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time and how you needed to be, to stay a human being, the, we did not live in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, we were moved, because you could not stay in your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="559">You had to move to first, to so-called <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> that had a big star on them and, eventually to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="560">And because of the history of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we did not move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but this house <span class="BUILDING">Zichy street One</span>, was designated as a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="561">So, in the meantime, we moved out of, of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in, that was 1944, summer when you had to leave your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="562">We, the neighbors came, some of them, and said "We will keep this for you, and keep this for you," and needless to say, that not one thing eventually survived again.</sentence><sentence id="563">Or resurfaced again.</sentence><sentence id="564">They all, either the Russians took it, or the bombing or everything.</sentence><sentence id="565">It's all disappeared, and what could you do about it?You said okay.</sentence><sentence id="566">But people were in a way like vultures, they were just circling around and see, you know, what they can take.</sentence><sentence id="567">And then the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was given, all these Jewish</sentence><sentence id="569">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp;

were liberated on January 18 and the first thing I went back to see, what, what happened to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because we left, believe it or not, a few boxes of linen there, just when we left.</sentence><sentence id="572">We just, we couldn't do anything with it, so.</sentence><sentence id="573">And when I came, when I went up there, I had this tremendous chip on my shoulder that I'm going to show these people whoever are there, that within two hours, I said I'm going to give them two hours to get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="574">And here I was a sixteen year old kid, barely sixteen, fifteen really, and telling them, here was a family and I was telling them to get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="575">And the family consisted of a mother, father, a daughter and two sons.</sentence><sentence id="576">And they were tailors.</sentence><sentence id="577">And the old man was quite old, the father, was telling me, he said, "But, but, where can we go?"</sentence><sentence id="578">And I said, "Why did you come here?"</sentence><sentence id="579">And he said, "Well, we have, we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="580">Our, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was destroyed, and I mean we knew that this is, this was a <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartment</span>, but still it was between this or living in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, in the cold snowy January," so he said, "Could, could you do something, could, could we somehow come to some kind of an agreement?"</sentence><sentence id="581">And so my mother came up and she said, "Why can't we just divide the <span class="NPIP">place</span> between us?"</sentence><sentence id="582">And here it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">two room apartment</span> with their family, four people, five people in their families and two, my mother and I, and we decided that after looking at them and listening to them and all this, there was just something that all of a sudden hit me.</sentence><sentence id="583">My chip was gone and so we decided that yes, we were going to, we'll, we'll make it.</sentence><sentence id="584">And so we lived there under the same <span class="DLF">roof</span> and we became very good friends.</sentence><sentence id="585">And when my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in late spring, the new government, Democratic government, devised this plan of each <span class="DLF">block</span> had to elect a kind of a small council and the head of that council was quite powerful in deciding if there was an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or, almost like a Justice of Peace.</sentence><sentence id="586">They had certain tasks that they can perform, temporarily, they were deputized.</sentence><sentence id="587">And my father was appointed to do this because he was always very much respected by the people there and the fact that he was now good, you know, with the new regime.</sentence><sentence id="588">And next to us, an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was full of old, old women who died one after another.</sentence><sentence id="589">It was a, like a <span class="BUILDING">Salvation Army place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="590">They, they rented it and it became empty, so my father got the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for them and they moved over there so we could get our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back, we lived there, but they could never really thank enough and we, we kept this relationship for a long time and I'm sorry I lost contact with them.</sentence><sentence id="591">But then, we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and then we faced something else because then the Russians were coming around and trying to find <span class="NPIP">places</span> for their soldiers and so they, they got, they got two old Russian soldiers from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> who were quartered in, in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were too many for three people.</sentence><sentence id="592">So, and I remember, they were very cute old men, we had no, I mean we had sign language, we didn't speak Russian and the only incident I remember is that my mother, of all these sufferings, had one little symbol in her possession: a bottle of very expensive cologne water that she kept.</sentence><sentence id="593">And she said, "I am going to start using this after the war, when we are all together and we live in peace."</sentence><sentence id="594">And so, and she kept it and she had it with her all the time.</sentence><sentence id="595">And so now, when we moved back, she, we got a temporarily, kind of an

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2776">Q: And some of them were her brothers and sisters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2778">A: Yes, they were, they were, I start out with my mother, then my father's three sisters, okay?Among them this Aranka, Goldie, and eventually my father's two brothers, too, joined us.</sentence><sentence id="2779">They were also under some kind of a disguise as policemen or this and that in whatever uniform they could get, but when things were really tough the last, I think, ten days or two weeks, they joined us, so they were there, too.</sentence><sentence id="2780">Then there were some husbands, my, one of my aunts had a husband and a boyfriend.</sentence><sentence id="2781">It was a triangle that the family just tolerated because the boyfriend was a much nicer person than the husband, everybody, so there was even humor then.</sentence><sentence id="2782">And some children.</sentence><sentence id="2783">So we might, it's possible we were even more than ten and that was very fortunate, a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> have a lot more than just ten people because this was, it sound like, it seemed like a safe haven and of course, all the relatives were coming and you wouldn't want to throw out your relatives and so... a lot of very famous doctors were there who then went on and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and elsewhere and the whole family was there, so.</sentence></p></dialogue>

RG-50.549.05*0001 52 Party, which was understandable because we felt that the Communist Party was going to be the one that revenges all these atrocities and whatever happened, and then we saw that almost everybody who was in the Arrow Cross movement is also in the Communist Party because people easily turned, that's obvious, you know, a lot of books and essays were written about how anybody who is an extremist in one way can become the extremist in--on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2938">So we found that and that was disgusting, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="2939">And the Communist Party knew about it and they defended it and we didn't like that, their terminology, and so we quit.</sentence><sentence id="2940">So then we went back to, and kind of regrouped as old boy scouts.</sentence><sentence id="2941">But our heart was not in it because now, I mean for so many years we could not do anything as boy scouts except go out and hike in nature, we couldn't even wear a kerchief.</sentence><sentence id="2942">And so now we could wear a uniform and some of us really bought a uniform, and then we just, we just lost completely our lust for boy scout life and that didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="2943">Then, you know, this was, another year went by and I, of the four, I broke away from the other four and I joined the Zionists.</sentence><sentence id="2944">They just, there were a lot of things that appealed to me, the fact that, finally, I am going to have a <span class="NPIP">homeland</span>, finally, I am going to have a passport, there was adventure.</sentence><sentence id="2945">Immediately, they send me up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and I had to go through a certain instruction, more than one, on more than one occasion.</sentence><sentence id="2946">And they, I advanced, I was pretty eager and good at learning things, and I became a youth leader in the movement and I loved to be with young people.</sentence><sentence id="2947">And so that, to me, was a, was a very happy period of my life.</sentence><sentence id="2948">My only conflict was with my parents.</sentence><sentence id="2949">Since I was an only child, of course, they wanted me around as much as possible, and I reached that rebellious teenage period, I was not too rebellious, but rebellious enough to move out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at sixteen and go to a Zionist children's home where first I was just a, a resident and I liked being with my peer group.</sentence><sentence id="2950">There were many, there were many in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, a lot of the survivors, young people of my age, just chose this as a lifestyle.</sentence><sentence id="2951">And what we were doing there, we received a lot of instructions in agriculture, in the language, Hebrew language, in Jewish history, to prepare us when we go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2952">And my parents, of course, didn't like for me being away at sixteen and I felt really sorry for them and once the rebellious period ended, in about a half a year or so, I moved back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and one of the reasons was that life was too free on these, it was the perfect kind of thesis, anti-thesis, that we were so restricted, now everything was free, I mean, and I was a little bit of a, I was a strange kid because I didn't grow up very quickly to become a man, and I did not like the fact that here were girls of my age who wanted to sleep with me and all this and that, I just, I always pictured myself more of a, an individual, a man who has things to do and I don't, I'm not going to spend a lot of time with, with sex and all this and my mind was not only on just women, let's put it this way, even though I already had sexual experiences and the whole, and because of this, they considered me a little bit of an eccentric so that happy, I moved back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to satisfy my parents, but I didn't stay there long enough because I got an offer at the age of seventeen to go and be a resident advisor in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Jewish orphans.</sentence><sentence id="2953">That was on, it was called <span class="DLF">Tarogato Street</span> in the Buda section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> where I found a man who became a very good friend of mine, the man who led the institution, a marvelous man, also a Zionist, by the name of Spitzer* and his family, and they were very good to me and I felt very much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, plus I got a nice salary and all my needs were taken care of USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 53 there.</sentence><sentence id="2954">Even I had a girlfriend who was also a resident counselor there, so happy, really, they were very happy days.</sentence><sentence id="2955">And in the meantime, I also participated very actively in, I changed organizations and left, I was in a, I would say, kind of a petit bourgeois Zionist group and I went over to the Marxists because that suited my philosophy a lot more and I stayed with them and eventually they were the ones that helped me to then immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, that was after, but we'll get to this.</sentence><sentence id="2956">Now I want to talk just a little bit about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because all these times I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="2957">Right after the, 1945, as soon as the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started, my mother was determined that I should go to the <span class="BUILDING">School of Commerce</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> were specialized, and there was one that was called, the Special High School for Commerce.</sentence><sentence id="2958">Can you stop it for a second because I want to close the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2959">So as I said, my mother was determined that I should go there, of course, I had no desire but I was still a good boy and I started at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the fact that it was the middle of the year, basically, and I missed the first half of a year wasn't a big problem because anybody who was a, a Holocaust survivor at that time can just about do anything.</sentence><sentence id="2960">So this was no big problem, the big problem came when I noticed how many of my teachers are outright anti-American, anti- Russian, anti-Semitic, they haven't changed their attitude and there were some other Jewish kids in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I got together with them and I asked them if, if we should tolerate this, if they think this is correct and everybody was kind of lying low, the usual way, and I said, "No, I am not going to do that."</sentence><sentence id="2961">There was specifically one teacher who had, I forgot, had a German name, a very small man who not only was anti-Semitic and anti-Russian and anti-everything and very pro-German, but agitating.</sentence><sentence id="2962">He was not just making statements, he was really agitating and in a very emotional way and I was, I just, I reached a point where I just couldn't take it anymore, not after what happened, just, you know, in the last few years and my boy scout commander, and at that time I was still kind of hanging on with the boy scout movement, my boy scout commander was now a member of the new Hungarian Secret Police and he was an officer and he escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and went over to the Russians and all this and came back with the Russian troops already and was one of the organizers.</sentence><sentence id="2963">And I went to see him and I said, "This man should be removed from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2964">And they did take him in and somehow they went down the list at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and found out that I was the one who reported him because it was obvious since I was constantly arguing with him, arguing with him in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and so. .</sentence><sentence id="2965">., Side A</sentence><sentence id="2967">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp;

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3007">Q: Okay, this is tape one, side B of an interview with Robert Holczer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3009">A: I just had to quit.</sentence><sentence id="3010">And then I continued my studies, I did not want to have the same experience again and I went to the Jewish, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish rabbi school</span>, really, what it was, it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to educate future teachers, but it was a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> still.</sentence><sentence id="3011">Just like my previous <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was specialized for commercial jobs, this one was, basically, a <span class="BUILDING">teaching gymnasium</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">teaching high school</span>, which meant by the laws of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time that once you finished--and it was instead of four, five classes, so you were nineteen when you finished the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>--you were then an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> teacher at the age of nineteen without any college education.</sentence><sentence id="3012">I was there at this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and, of course, as far as any kind of a bad experience, I didn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="3013">Now I was among my own people, there were some very, very good friends, I liked the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it was nothing special, it was not challenging me, the only aspect most of us didn't like is the religious aspect, which we didn't take very seriously.</sentence><sentence id="3014">So actually, I was still in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in my eighteenth year when eventually, and we will go back to this, I emigrated, emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and so I never really finished my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3015">But out of deference to what happened and all this, I got a diploma.</sentence><sentence id="3016">So I had a high school diploma which, of course, my parents got later because I needed one and... so these are the two <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3017">Once I reached this level of the, this, the Jewish teaching high school for, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for future teachers, whatever, it's very difficult to translate into English, perhaps Lyceum is a good name for it, once I reached that, then as far as my experiences after the Holocaust, there was no problem, you know, it's obvious.</sentence><sentence id="3018">Now, going back, of course in the meantime, in the Zionist movement, a lot of changes took place because we had to go practically underground.</sentence><sentence id="3019">As the communist regime established itself in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and in 1948 the famous turn, Year of the Turn came about, which happened in every <span class="REGION">Eastern European country</span>, and the Year of the Turn is an expression when the communists took control, complete power, because until 1948, we had democracy in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>, those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that knew what democracy was.</sentence><sentence id="3020">And <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had some very able politicians and was really on its <span class="DLF">road</span> to become a democracy, so was <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and probably <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, too, of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was very different.</sentence><sentence id="3021">But, in 1948, everything has changed, we became, again, just like with the illegal boy scout group before 1945, I found myself belonging to an illegal organization, Zionism was outlawed because all of a sudden Stalin and company found Zionism, of course, a tool of the imperialists as they called it.</sentence><sentence id="3022">So we were doing, basically, the same things that we were doing before, but now very cautiously, illegally, and meetings were held usually either in some far away <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> or in some <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanages</span> where it was not very obvious if, let's say, twenty, thirty people came in and out because there were hundreds of people living there anyway.</sentence><sentence id="3023">The, many times we paraded as young communists, if we wanted to have a larger meeting somewhere, singing communist songs when somebody came by, but otherwise doing our own business.</sentence><sentence id="3024">By 1949, early 1949, the situation almost was intolerable and, basically, they wanted to have the whole Zionist movement leave, not the communists, but the Zionist movement wanted to get as many people out as possible, fearing that if <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> is going to turn also completely communist, that there will be no way from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to go anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="3025">By that</sentence><sentence id="3027">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 55 time we could only go illegally across the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3028">And I think it was in February, 1949, that I got an order from my Zionist leadership to go to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">northern town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vacz</span>, V-A-C-Z, my mother comes from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they knew it.</sentence><sentence id="3029">My job was to go to the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and ask him if he would like to have a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> orchestra give a, an evening concert on some given date.</sentence><sentence id="3030">I went there, I mentioned to the mayor that I had been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vacz</span> many, many times because my grandparents, cousins, aunts, I had a lot of relatives and my mother was born here, and of course, he was overwhelmed that a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> orchestra is coming to play.</sentence><sentence id="3031">I then went to a printer, this was one of my instructions, and had all kinds of posters printed advertising the date and the concert.</sentence><sentence id="3032">Went back, reported it and the next command was that on a certain day, I would have to go with an instrument or with an instrument case to a comer of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and there would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> there, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">state bus</span>, by that time every bus company was nationalized, and I have to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with a lot of other people and I have to pretend that I am a member of a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> band, whatever instrument I am playing, and do, not to talk about anything, Zionism or <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="3033">And just wait for further instructions there.</sentence><sentence id="3034">And of course, I was notified that this is it, that we would be going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I bid farewell to my family and got an instrument case, boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> on a certain date and time and I saw all my fellow Zionist members, the ones who were in my group, and we started toward the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian border</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3063">Q: Can I ask a few questions before we go on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3065">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3067">Q: I wanted to, I'm interested in hearing how you felt about Marxism, why it was that Marxism appealed to you as far as the type of Zionist organization that you were involved in and hearing a little bit more about how you felt about the politics of the time and the communist takeover.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3069">A: I had very ambivalent feelings like a lot of those Jews who did not come from the upper middle class or upper class.</sentence><sentence id="3070">I came from definitely no better than the middle of the middle class or rather, perhaps, the lower middle class.</sentence><sentence id="3071">My father came from a very low class proletarian family which was very unusual among the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3072">My mother came from a little petit bourgeois family from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">northern Hungarian town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3073">They thought they were middle class, but it depends on how you classify this, as far as I'm concerned they were kind of a pseudo-petit bourgeois people, the kind who, it's very difficult to define them, but there was not much work and a lot of complaining.</sentence><sentence id="3074">Now, because I never had a very, let's say satisfactory and wealthy life, naturally I had some sympathies with, with the Marxist movement, it's obvious.</sentence><sentence id="3075">Second, I had a very definite sympathy with them because they were the most adamant about taking the war criminals and punish them.</sentence><sentence id="3076">They were the most anti-fascist and all these things appealed to me.</sentence><sentence id="3077">I was, you can consider even though I was not a member, really after my one month experience, I was not a member, at least I didn't consider myself a member of the Communist Party, but I certainly was sympathizing with a lot of their goals, even though I was in a completely different game by that time, knowing I would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3078">But, this is probably why I changed my affiliation and went from a</sentence><sentence id="3080">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 56 bourgeoisie Zionist organization to a Marxist Zionist organization where I felt very much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3081">And there were, of course, ugly things happening, the communist takeover in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> was not a very pleasant occasion.</sentence><sentence id="3082">And one only had to think a little bit clearly and rise above all this emotion to see that the communists used very nasty methods to eliminate anyone who disagreed with them.</sentence><sentence id="3083">And the more power they grabbed, the more vicious they became.</sentence><sentence id="3084">And of course, eventually I, the Zionists suffered more what anybody who was considered a Zionist or anybody, like my father, who could have been executed if they discovered that he was with Tito, so if you were an enemy for one reason or another, there was no law.</sentence><sentence id="3085">The communists created their own laws, the secret police had free hand and, of course, I began to become very disappointed in that.</sentence><sentence id="3086">My father, he was always a Social Democrat, and he never, never approved what the Communist Party was doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3087">And he was very courageous because when the Communist Party gobbled up the Social Democratic Party, he sent in a postcard and said, "Excuse me, but I don't want to join you."</sentence><sentence id="3088">Which was very courageous because from there on, you could have been watched.</sentence><sentence id="3089">The fact that he comes from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working class</span> and was a very little fish, I think saved his life.</sentence><sentence id="3090">But if he had been a name, probably he would have been killed then.</sentence><sentence id="3091">And so, politics, yes, I kept my eye on politics all the time and this helped me in 1949 to just go, because I figured there will never be peace here, there will never be peace here.</sentence><sentence id="3092">And, do you have any other questions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3119">Q: Mmm-hmm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3121">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3123">Q: As far as, you had mentioned that there were some serious anti-Semitic incidents at your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I am wondering if you had any expectations after the war was over that some of that would be ameliorated and that anti-Semitism was not going to be as much of a problem any more?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3125">A: Yes, I was very naive, really, at the age of fifteen, for some reason, I thought that a better world is coming.</sentence><sentence id="3126">And I was deeply disappointed when I heard that there were even pogroms in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> where a few Jews dared to come back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, I think the Czechs were the only ones who acted in a very civilized way, but then they were always civilized and the most civilized in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3127">That disappointed me, people were killed, survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and killed in a pogrom in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and in some other <span class="REGION">Eastern European countries</span>, two years after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3128">And that made me very bitter and my idealism and my naivete really evaporated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3133">Q: Did you experience anything directly, any anti-Semitic incidents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3135">A: I have not been directly in an anti-Semitic incidence because I avoided, I avoided them, I avoided any kind of such thing.</sentence><sentence id="3136">I associated mainly with my own kind because I saw that there is no hope.</sentence><sentence id="3137">Now, this interestingly must have changed to a certain extent because almost every one of my cousins is married to a gentile in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, I think with the exception of maybe two, but every one of them, and the marriages are very solid.</sentence><sentence id="3138">So I, and it's not,</sentence><sentence id="3140">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 57 they are still not what you would call a truly middle class family, that most of them still stayed in, you know, auto mechanics and this and that, that part.</sentence><sentence id="3141">Now, the ones who are up there, went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and became dentists and those, they are all married to other Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3142">It's a very interesting phenomenon.</sentence><sentence id="3143">But I have not experienced anything except when, right after the war at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3144">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="3145">I heard people constantly yelling anti-Semitic slogans, especially at <span class="BUILDING">soccer games</span>, but I knew that I can't expect anything else any more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3163">Q: And you, when you joined the Zionist organization, did you have, did you really have dreams of being in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, or that this, that this was something that you felt very strongly about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3165">A: Yes, I had dreams and that was probably a, a, just a marvelous high of my youth.</sentence><sentence id="3166">The whole, the Zionists did a, a fantastic job in catching the spirit of young people and really giving us what we wanted to have.</sentence><sentence id="3167">We had a relatively free life, we had, we had a picture of a heroic future for us, whether we are going to be still serving in the army in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or just working in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> as farmers, almost everything about it had a kind of a super human touch that I'm going to be better than all these people around here who are running around like ants on the cities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, I'm going to lead a very healthy life, and finally I'm going to have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I will have a <span class="REGION">fatherland</span> and it was, it was a marvelous feeling.</sentence><sentence id="3168">And also, the whole, the whole setup, the whole organization, you know, until then, until 1946 or so, most of the picture that we saw of Jewish people is, is like sheep going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3169">And all of a sudden these people come from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they are beautiful looking people.</sentence><sentence id="3170">And not only that, they had courage, the way they carried themselves and they were teaching us a lot of things, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> sent a lot of, they called them Schliahs, people that, those who are sent, I think, literally.</sentence><sentence id="3171">And they were in charge of all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where we had to go to where we were taught self-defense and, you know, we lived on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I think what, for forty-eight hours, we were given a piece of rope and a knife and we had to stay up, and sleep up there and make our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and all this.</sentence><sentence id="3172">I mean, which young person doesn't like this?</sentence><sentence id="3173">The whole image of the Jew has changed in our mind and we said, "God, it's beautiful."</sentence><sentence id="3174">And when we were in danger, they were the ones who led us out of danger.</sentence><sentence id="3175">I remember once I was up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Berzseny mountains</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in a self-defense camp for a week and somebody betrayed us to the police and the police surrounded us and there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span>, not deeper, I don't think it was deeper than maybe twenty inches, and guess who is the one who escaped from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span> in order to do something, not to save his own skin, but he was immediately telephoning and all this and that and eventually we were released.</sentence><sentence id="3176">The Israeli whatever, diplomat, I can't call them, the diplomat is not the right word because you picture somebody, you know, with a tie and suit and all this, but they were just, I, messengers or whatever, leaders.</sentence><sentence id="3177">And he escaped, he escaped in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span>, crawling in twenty inch of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, you know, getting on something that blend in with the, with the rocks, I mean they were unbelievable, unbelievable people.</sentence><sentence id="3178">And women, you know, it's, it's, okay, after them the women came and, I mean this is a completely different Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3179">I mean, and when I took my wife to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, she understood that, that there was just something about those kids.</sentence><sentence id="3180">And so this, this, of course, was, they were idols and it was very

the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> going back to my escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> eventually reached <span

suggested to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> driver that we stop somewhere and eat and there was a <span class="BUILDING">roadside pub</span> where they also served food.</sentence><sentence id="3186">We went in and we were given money and we could order something, and in that <span class="BUILDING">pub</span>, there was a very beautiful peasant woman, with I don't know how many skirts on her, this was the reason you recognize a peasant woman, in those days they still wore a lot of skirts, you know, that's an Eastern European costume that a dozen skirts is no big deal.</sentence><sentence id="3187">And she started to flirt with the bus driver.</sentence><sentence id="3188">And soon the bus driver came, went over to her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>,

1:00 or so, the <span class="DLF">barn door</span> opened and we were, they said we have to get on <span class="DLF">line</span> and marched down, there was the river Ipoly, I-P-O-L-Y, and that was

everything was organized there, I will go back to this.</sentence><sentence id="3201">So as we were marching down, I saw a woman in a leather jacket with a revolver hanging on her hip in blue

February, imagine.</sentence><sentence id="3212">We got over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and it was supposed to be that the border guards change, everything was according to the clock, and something happened and the border guards did not change the way they were supposed to, they were still talking to each other.</sentence><sentence id="3213">There was snow on the <span

there.</sentence><sentence id="3215">I myself, I lost, I got frostbitten and even today I suffer for that.</sentence><sentence id="3216">Now, then the border guards finally were gone and we went up, there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they used to press grapes, it was a grape growing region, but had no <span class="DLF">roof</span> and the wind was blowing and I remember, I don't think I have ever been colder in my life since then.</sentence><sentence id="3217">And so we huddled together because now we missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that was supposed

on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, the canvas, the top was taken down, and from there on, all we heard was the engine of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was occasionally, when

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3286">A: I, my best friend in that group was a young man by the name of Zev Rotics.</sentence><sentence id="3287">He lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at this time still, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span>, at <span class="BUILDING">Rehov Shunamit 14</span>, and we correspond monthly, we have been ever since, ever since that time, and eventually when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, we corresponded, we kept up and I consider him my best friend.</sentence><sentence id="3288">He's about the only person I keep up with.</sentence><sentence id="3289">Oh no, there was one, another, a man by the name of Nissan Meschel, and I have no, he is in touch with my friend, Zev Rotics, but I lost touch with him, so I have no idea what happened, I just know that he's living there.</sentence><sentence id="3290">But the others, the, I remember one young lady who was with us and she, unfortunately, had eventually pneumonia when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, which I will go back to when I continue the story of the journey, and died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> of pneumonia, and she's buried there somewhere in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and I always planned to go and visit her, but I always run out of time and I don't know where she is buried, probably there is no more than one <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>, so when I go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I'm going to find out because my wife... Zev Rotics, sometimes he goes to the meetings of our old friends and so he would know.</sentence><sentence id="3291">Now, after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> finally stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3292">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">gendarmerie</span> where, as a formality, we were arrested, and interned in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that had already warm <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, straw on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, blankets, good food, everything, and we were told that next morning we are going on.</sentence><sentence id="3293">And it was very strange because next morning, again, the gendarmerie surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, it was a big show, of course, all just in case some Soviet authority is watching.</sentence><sentence id="3294">And they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where we were taken in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, how interesting, locked up, quite a few people in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started and I think within an hour or so, they opened up and we were in the American sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3295">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> is very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3296">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> for, I think, two, one or two weeks, and in an <span class="BUILDING">American hospital</span>, that's where the Joint somehow got an <span class="BUILDING">American hospital</span> for the Zionist members and we were all there and we were given good food and warm rooms and it was very pleasant, the only thing we were always warmed about, not to ever wander into the Soviet section.</sentence><sentence id="3297">We were free to wander around, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was still divided into four sections, American, British, French and Soviet.</sentence><sentence id="3298">And sometimes we had to go very close to the <span class="REGION">Soviet section</span> in going to, I remember going to a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span>, it was on the edge, and so everybody was nervous.</sentence><sentence id="3299">But, basically, it was a good time.</sentence><sentence id="3300"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was full of refugees, full of life.</sentence><sentence id="3301">After one week or so, then we were taken across, again by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> into, no I have to correct myself, to, not to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, to a, a, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA camp</span>, <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was the United Nations Refugee Association or something, so the joint gave us temporarily over to <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and we were housed in a beautiful area of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zaalfelden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3302">It is a, on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>, just the other side from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and there were some very picturesque <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> nearby, and I remember even though here the food was very meager and we still were hiking almost every day and going up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and I remember that just above our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span>, there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">mountain hut</span> where Hitler and Mussolini met and we had to see it and sometimes a cabbage soup a day just didn't give us enough energy, but we were still</sentence><sentence id="3304">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp;

"</sentence><sentence id="3323">What time?"</sentence><sentence id="3324">He said, "From 1948 to 1950 something."</sentence><sentence id="3325">Well, he was on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, you know, and I mean it was a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and he was one of the sailors.</sentence><sentence id="3326">Well, when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span>, of course, that was a very emotional scene and then eventually, the war, basically, was finished and there was no temporary animosity so then we, our movement went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> there where we then blended in and one year after we were taught a trade in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and we got our own <span class="REGION">land</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="3327">I don't know what else you want to know about the Israeli thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3372">Q: Everyone from your group then who was travelling together went to the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3374">A: Yes, everyone went to the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> except the ones who did not want to go to the</sentence><sentence id="3376">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 62 kibbutz, had relatives who were waiting for them and this was a little bit of a disappointment to us because theoretically, everybody was supposed to stay together, but this was not the case.</sentence><sentence id="3377">There were, not everybody wants to live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> because it is a very difficult living for those who dream of money and wealth and their own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and all this because it's a, at that time it was a very perfect community, but it was a community, you didn't have a great deal that you owned at all, you know, you were lucky if you had a radio that you can call your own.</sentence><sentence id="3378">So we lost, I would say, about one-third of our group who had planned, but not shared their plan with us, to go immediately and stay on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3386">Q: How was it decided that your group would go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, was it decided communally among the group or did someone else decide it for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3388">A: All Zionist youth organizations basically, with very little exception, very few exceptions, were geared toward the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3389">This was an understanding back in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> where we were recruited that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and they always brought the example of the <span class="DLF">pyramid</span>, that the, we Jews, we always like a pyramid on the top, we had all the, the farmers, and down at the bottom where the <span class="DLF">pyramid</span> is the largest, we had all the intellectuals, and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> needed a <span class="DLF">pyramid</span> upside down, where the largest group is going to be the farmers and the agricultural group, and the smallest one is going to be the intellectuals, the tip of the <span class="DLF">pyramid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3390">So almost every Zionist organization, that was the very strong influence and educational goal to teach you to go and be a farmer in a collective, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3391">So that was the reason why most of us did go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3392">And who decided it?</sentence><sentence id="3393">It was decided above, that had nothing to do with us, where we would go, we were assigned to an old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, very old, experienced, large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Givat Chajim</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> which is in, about midway between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> and this is where we learned our trade for one year, we stayed there for one year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3400">Q: Did you speak any Hebrew at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3402">A: We did not speak any Hebrew when we arrived there, most of us didn't speak any Hebrew, except the ones who came from very religious families.</sentence><sentence id="3403">They knew quite a bit and for them it was much easier to learn, we spoke no Yiddish because Hungarians do not speak, Hungarian Jews, very few Hungarian Jews speak Yiddish, and so at first we felt a little bit kind of ostracized by the community, especially the young Israeli kids.</sentence><sentence id="3404">There were so many Hungarians coming in at that time that the Hungarians even had a nickname in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they were called Igen-Migen, Igen means yes in Hungarian and so kids would go after us on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and call us Igen-Migen, Igen-Migen, because they heard us speak.</sentence><sentence id="3405">And so we were in a big hurry to learn Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="3406">And then when we learned Hebrew, we had another thing, the Hungarian language is such that your accent stays with you no matter what language you learn, and so we had a very thick accent, even when we were speaking Hebrew, so we had our difficulties with the language, but most of us learned it eventually.</sentence><sentence id="3407">I was there in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for two years and by the time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I was really speaking fluently.</sentence></p></dialogue>

eventually, that they were, they were working for the local, you know, sheik or whomever owns the <span class="REGION">land</span> for very little.</sentence><sentence id="3440">And eventually, we also saw that here on this side of the <span class="DLF">border</span> we are plowing with up-to-date 20"-century machinery and we saw not far from us, a man on a horseback whipping people just because they did something apparently that did not please them.</sentence><sentence id="3441">The owner of the <span class="REGION">land</span> had practically complete jurisdiction over these poor fellows, and that was just a few hundred yards from where we were working.</sentence><sentence id="3442">As they got used to us, they came closer and closer and when they saw that we don't mean any harm, they came down to the barbed wire many times, watching to make sure that nobody sees them and tried to make friends with us and we did make friends with them for, the main reason is that chocolate was very expensive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> those days, cocoa, and we already had quite a few children in our group, babies.</sentence><sentence id="3443">Cigarettes were very expensive for some reason in <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> and they were very cheap in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, American cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="3444">So they asked, oh, these people offered us a deal, but they did not want to do it during the day because they were afraid that the... <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> had the best military force, the Arab Legion, trained by the British and they were afraid that they were patrolling there and all this and it was a serious crime to deal with, with Israelis.</sentence><sentence id="3445">So at</sentence><sentence id="3447">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 64 night in the darkness, and I remember it was my turn, too, it was always a few people and always the tractor drivers because we had the contact with the border people, we went down because they would recognize us and it was a very risky thing, they could have just shot me dead right there, it could have been a trap.</sentence><sentence id="3448">We went down and we were doing all the business, they jumped over or we went over, but mainly they came over because they were much better fence jumpers than we were.</sentence><sentence id="3449">So this was one contact that we had.</sentence><sentence id="3450">The other one was not so pleasant, these wadis, dry <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river beds</span>, that run across, they don't recognize <span class="DLF">borders</span>, they run, you know, back and forth, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span>, and in, when they are dry which is most of the time, this is where the Arab thieves come over, they use these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river beds</span> because you can't see them, they are, you know, they are like little canyons.</sentence><sentence id="3451">And they would come over in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river beds</span> and go into other <span class="REGION">areas</span> and steal, mainly animals.</sentence><sentence id="3452">And they were unbelievably good thieves.</sentence><sentence id="3453">They would steal, they can, they would steal a cattle, they would steal a donkey, they would steal a horse surrounded by <span class="DLF">walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3454">Nobody could ever figure out how they did it.</sentence><sentence id="3455">So the army hired us to be kind of a paramilitary force and go out and lie, so we had to lie down in the wadis and a few of us, we didn't have very good guns, we had old Czech guns, and wait for these thieves to come.</sentence><sentence id="3456">And I only had one occasion when three of us were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> and there were about fifteen or twenty of these coming by and we didn't feel like getting murdered by them because what chances do we have?</sentence><sentence id="3457">And so we let them go by and then reported to the border police that they went by, but we didn't want to engage in any fire fight there.</sentence><sentence id="3458">Now, my good experience was with the Jordanian Legion, which then eventually had also a sad ending.</sentence><sentence id="3459">All of a sudden one day we were, I was plowing I remember, and I had to have always a guard on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span> with a submachine gun who was constantly casing and watching because I was so close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and this was a friend of mine one day who was a guard in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arab POW camp</span>, an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Israeli POW camp</span>, guarding Arabs during the War of Independence, so he learned some Arabic from them.</sentence><sentence id="3460">And you will see why this is important, and all of a sudden we saw some, an Arab Legion patrol right by the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and they were motioning to us to come down and we said no, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3461">And so they went away.</sentence><sentence id="3462">Next day they came and again they were motioning, they said, "Peace, peace."</sentence><sentence id="3463">So finally they went back about fifty yards and they put their guns into a pile and then came back, showing that they had no weapons and they told us, "Sit down on that side of the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3464">What can we do?"</sentence><sentence id="3465">They were about twelve, if they really wanted to kill us, we said, "Okay, let's go down.</sentence><sentence id="3466">What do they want?"</sentence><sentence id="3467">They just wanted to talk to us and from there on, every day they would come down at a certain time and eventually they, the Arabs have watermelon all over, so it was like a party, they would yell at one of these poor fellows who was working there and I, this is all I learned in Arabic, what it is, "Hey, bring me a watermelon."</sentence><sentence id="3468"><span class="BUILDING">Yalla Jibbu Battiyah</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3469">And they brought a watermelon and they would slice it and we were eating, almost every day we had a little lunch there together, we brought some stuff.</sentence><sentence id="3470">And this went on for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.</sentence><sentence id="3471">And eventually we really fooled our <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> because sometimes they came over and ate and laughed that they ate in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and sometimes we jumped over and we said, "Oh, we ate in <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3472">And one day it was our turn, we stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span>, they haven't come down yet so we were waiting for them, but we were already sitting on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, we had a little blanket, we put it down, all the food from our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and all of a sudden a patrol is there, but it is a totally different patrol.</sentence><sentence id="3473">What happened, apparently somebody saw them and</sentence><sentence id="3475">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 65 reported them, I don't know what ever happened, I never saw them again and these guys were, they drew their guns and they are going to shoot us.</sentence><sentence id="3476">And you know that <span class="DLF">border</span> was no joke, every night somebody was killed there, either an Israeli or an Arab.</sentence><sentence id="3477">Very innocent people, you know, sometimes a, one night I felt so badly, a young couple, lovers, were walking around and apparently they were in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> and an Israeli guard, and most of the Israeli border guards were from <span class="REGION">Arab countries</span>, Arab Jews, well, not Arab, that sounds kind of strange, but Jews from <span class="REGION">Arab countries</span>, and they were vicious.</sentence><sentence id="3478">I mean, you could not get better border guards and they were, they hated the Arabs more than we hated the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="3479">And so they were, they were, they saw one at night, they were shooting sometimes for no reason.</sentence><sentence id="3480">So that was a very poisonous atmosphere there, and I mean it took a long time and the fact that my friend spoke some Arabic and all this and mitigated the situation, but then the man said, "How come you speak some Arabic?</sentence><sentence id="3481">Where did you learn it?"</sentence><sentence id="3482">And then he had to kind of, so finally the sergeant who was leading all them, always a master sergeant leading the patrol, he said, "You have one luck that I have a son of your age."</sentence><sentence id="3483">He said, "If I ever see you even down touching the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>," he said, "I am going to just make dust out of you."</sentence><sentence id="3484">And of course, we never went back again.</sentence><sentence id="3485">That was, these are some experiences living on the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3539">A: Well, it was a very simple conversation because we had a language problem, it was mainly sign language quite a bit, and we were talking about, basically, these people were talking about their children, they showed pictures of their families and the word peace, Salaam or Shalom in Hebrew, was constantly mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="3540">And I have a feeling that all of us involved, probably, if they are, hopefully they are alive, will always remember this and that kind of softened us up, so we know that human beings can relax under certain circumstances and we don't have to be enemies.</sentence><sentence id="3541">It was the first time that I realized that an Arab can, doesn't necessarily have to be my opponent, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3562">A: At first I was very, very idealistic.</sentence><sentence id="3563">Then somehow, I felt a little bit disappointed where in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, all kinds of political groups tried to kind of tear us apart.</sentence><sentence id="3564">And there were more and more arguments and somehow this and the fact that as the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> settled down into so- called peace, if we can call it, the usual symptoms that every nation in the world experiences, surfaced, such as crime and... but the fact that there were Jewish criminals, that shocked me.</sentence><sentence id="3565">You know, I was so naive that I thought that anybody goes to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, certainly doesn't want to do anything to hurt another human being.</sentence><sentence id="3566">There were even, even murderers, and I just one day after another, these things, they added to my little disappointment, but I was still enjoying myself because I love to be <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> and we, we did the physical work and it was all that a young person wants for self-image, good self-image, we had a very good self-image of ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="3567">There were two things that contributed to my, to my coming, going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> eventually in "51.</sentence><sentence id="3568">One was, all of a sudden I realized that I, in all my life I loved my father very, very much, and this is a, I mean it's a fact, there is nothing you can do about it, I loved my father more than I loved my mother.</sentence><sentence id="3569">Somehow I always considered my mother a little bit of a, of a kind of petit bourgeois that I never really completely understood.</sentence><sentence id="3570">And I thought that she was a little bit, she was just in another, in other words, she wanted me to be also, you know, like she was, and play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and all these things and I was not the type.</sentence><sentence id="3571">So I was not that close to her even though I was with her all the time and practically, I was also instrumental in saving her life in the war when I dragged her with me everywhere and all this, but my father, and I realized I spent very little time with my father as a young man because he was always away in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3572">And now he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and now they couldn't come any more, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was sealed.</sentence><sentence id="3573">And then I also, at the age of nineteen, became somehow involved with a group of cynical people.</sentence><sentence id="3574">And I met them here and there and some of them I knew from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and they were married to this and this, I just somehow was under the influence of these who saw nothing nice any more in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> except the bad things.</sentence><sentence id="3575">This, the homesickness plus the fact that then I began to get all kinds of propaganda material from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and somehow, this was the third thing, I was misled by all this, what I read, and I thought that the situation changed and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is such a marvelous <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="3576">And my parents tried to communicate to me, even though they never wanted me to really go away, but now they didn't want me to really come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they were afraid what would happen to me.</sentence><sentence id="3577">And that, they just apparently didn't come across quite well because I, eventually I just decided I want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and probably homesickness had a great deal to do, I, at that time as a young man, I didn't realize that you can't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3578">I envisioned that everything is going to be back and all this.</sentence><sentence id="3579">Well, I then applied to the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Embassy</span>, got a permit and the Israelis, of course, didn't keep me there, and in 1951, I returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3580">And those were the worst years, aside from October 15th, those years were the worst years of my life, the next two or three years.</sentence><sentence id="3583">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 67</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3606">Q: Before we go into more details about that, you mentioned that you found the Israelis very well organized as you were escaping from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3607">When you arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, did you, did you share the feeling that the way that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was organized was, was very good and smooth and, did you have any observations about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3610">A: The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> was also very well organized, this was an old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and it was like a clock work.</sentence><sentence id="3611">Also, there was a hierarchy which naturally some people didn't understand, but I had no argument with that because I realized a person who came here fifty years ago when there was nothing here except rocks and Arabs shooting at them, has, is more equal, right, than somebody who arrives here today.</sentence><sentence id="3612">It was well run, it was a wealthy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, there was very good food, there was culture, they made sure that orchestras are coming, good ones, entertainment, no, I had absolutely no feeling of let down in this respect.</sentence><sentence id="3613">No, I admired the way they carried on.</sentence><sentence id="3614">Just a little, just a little thing that shows that how they thought of everything: shoveling manure, for example, of course, not something that somebody wants to do for the rest of his or her life, so or washing dishes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, so there were, there were certain things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> that it was not a, an <span class="REGION">area</span> where you were assigned permanently, they were temporary.</sentence><sentence id="3615">And so everybody knew that once in a month I have to shovel manure and once a month or twice a month, I have to wash the dishes, so, there were some other, but even this was taken care of, you know, I think in a very human manner.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3622">Q: Did you have dreams or ideas of what exactly you would be doing when you went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, was that... was your sense of where you wanted to go in your life very developed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3624">A: I was naively thinking about going to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and continuing with my education to become a teacher, a high school teacher, and so I went back through the Bosporus, <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>, <span class="REGION">Black Sea</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and then <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3625">Travelling through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, in 1949, excuse me, 1951, was quite an experience, the people just looked at me, looked at me and since there are quite a few Hungarians in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, | then... eventually they found out that I speak Hungarian, so there was always a Hungarian there and asked me and I very naively give all the details of my life and all this and that, and I didn't understand why they looked at me, just looked at me, just looked at me, and also <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was tremendously gray and I could only think of 1984, going across <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3626">And that was only the beginning, 1951, you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3630">Q: You're referring to the book, 1984?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3632">A: Pardon me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3634">Q: You're referring to the book?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3636">A: Yes, I refer to the book /984, or the movie rather, okay?</sentence><sentence id="3637">It's the same thing, but the movie is the one that I always keep in my mind when I think of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3638">So I arrived on the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> and here was an officer on the <span class="DLF">border</span> looked at my papers and all this and</sentence><sentence id="3640">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 68 he, I'll never forget what he told me, he said to me, "I don't know where you come from, but it must have been very bad, very bad there, that you come from."</sentence><sentence id="3641">And he looked at me and said, "Welcome to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3642">And this was a border guard officer.</sentence><sentence id="3643">And I thought this is a strange thing, what does it mean?</sentence><sentence id="3644">Well, I learned very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="3645">When I boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again on the other side of the <span class="DLF">border</span>, it was just as gray as coming through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and then finally when I arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I looked around, I realized that I was totally, totally misled.</sentence><sentence id="3646">Never have I been misled before or after the way I was.</sentence><sentence id="3647">I arrived there and it was the grayest, most colorless, most suspicious, paranoid society you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="3648">And my bad period started with, of course, not being able to get a job, any job, there was no one, going to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, of course, was ridiculous to think about because I was an unreliable element, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, number one, from the West, I was an imperialist agent, as far as they were concerned, not only that, I was a Zionist imperialist agent.</sentence><sentence id="3649">And it took me almost six month to get a job to sweep a <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, to sweep floors and clean oil off the concrete in a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>, in a state-owned <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3666">Q: How did you get the <span class="BUILDING">job</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3668">A: With great connections, the fact that my father was from the working class and many of his brothers and their friends were involved, but mainly their friends of where they come from, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, a very poor one, suburb of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, where now the communist officials with great connections, but nobody wanted any names, nobody wanted to stick out their neck, they just somehow pushed some paperwork somewhere and I was an, kind of an auxiliary labor help, a no name person whom they hired because they needed somebody to clean something.</sentence><sentence id="3669">And that was the only job I could get.</sentence><sentence id="3670">What hurt me even more was the fact that my good friends on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, some of them who stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, not too many because most of them escaped, but they would not want anything to do with me because most people didn't want to touch me, didn't want to talk to me, they don't know me, they rather would go to the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> than to meet me.</sentence><sentence id="3671">Some probably out of disgust that how stupid a human being can be to come back to this, and others for fear.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3676">Q: Because you had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3678">A: Yes, yes, because I had been out, it doesn't have to be, it didn't have to be <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, anyone, it was a totally paranoid society, everything that happened in the Soviet Union was copied the next day, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3679">So the, I worked in this <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> for about six month and I always noticed with great nostalgia, how they have these posters about urging workers to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and I went to the Party secretary of the firm which had about twelve <span class="BUILDING">garages</span>, had to sign a paper that recommends you to go to the next step and every time I went to see him, he laughed at me, he said, "You know that you are here by the grace of a few people and not, you have no merits to go there."</sentence><sentence id="3680">So the, my break came when the secretary became very ill, the Party secretary of the firm, and they sent out a temporary Party secretary, and she was a woman, she was very busy when I entered, you know, dirty and overalls and all this, and when I told her what I wanted, I got an, this opportunity and try, now, when I told her what I wanted, she said, "Well, I don't have time to write you a</sentence><sentence id="3682">USHMM

don't you dictate what you need to my secretary and I will just sign it."</sentence><sentence id="3684">So I passed the first hurdle, with this I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where I had to submit this.</sentence><sentence id="3685">This was a committee, they interviewed you and they read your, you had to write your, your biography, autobiography for everything, everything.</sentence><sentence id="3686">So here was a committee, admitting committee, the Young Communist League, the Communist Party, one from the faculty, et cetera, about, I would say, seven, eight people.</sentence><sentence id="3687">And when they got to certain points, they said, "Come on, you must be joking that you really think that, you know, you can come here."</sentence><sentence id="3688">Well, I left and as I was going out a man whose name was Mr. Bartos, he was on the faculty, this was the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian Teachers Academy</span>, this was the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where I wanted to go, it was called the <span class="BUILDING">Teachers Academy</span>, but it was part of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3689">He came out and he said, "Holczer, Holczer, didn't your father play on a certain soccer team?"</sentence><sentence id="3690">I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="3691">He said, "Didn't your father have four or five brothers playing on the same soccer team?"</sentence><sentence id="3692">And he said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="3693">And he said, "Okay, come back in September and see, maybe since you were a minor when you left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I will try and write to the Ministry of Education, maybe something can be done."</sentence><sentence id="3694">Well, I was holding my breath for three months, I went back in September and I went into the Party secretary's office, they had no idea who I was, they couldn't find any paper, anything, so I was looking for him.</sentence><sentence id="3695">And I found him and he said, "Just a second."</sentence><sentence id="3696">He went into the Party secretary, he came out a few minutes later and he said, "I am very happy to inform you that the Minister of Education, on the basis that you were a minor when you left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, give you special permission to enter the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3697">And he said, "Now, this was the last time you ever talk to me, you ever looked at me, you ever even thought that we have anything to do with each other.</sentence><sentence id="3698">Never again."</sentence><sentence id="3699">He said, "That is the price.</sentence><sentence id="3700">You understand?"</sentence><sentence id="3701">I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="3702">Said, "and say hello to your dad."</sentence><sentence id="3703">That was it.</sentence><sentence id="3704">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my father remembered him, they played on the same team.</sentence><sentence id="3705">And he was the head of the physical education branch of the faculty, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3706">And this is how I got in.</sentence><sentence id="3707">And I had a very, very good time because I found out ninety-nine percent of the kids thought the same way as I did and there were very few communists, very few.</sentence><sentence id="3708">And yet, when it came to 1953, I almost was, I was thrown out for about one week.</sentence><sentence id="3709">Stalin was dying and when he, in his last breath, he looked up, he saw doctors around him and he was paranoia, he said, "Who are these?"</sentence><sentence id="3710">They said, "Doctors."</sentence><sentence id="3711">And Stalin was very anti-Semitic and he said, "Are they Jewish doctors?"</sentence><sentence id="3712">And I think, out of twelve or so, seven or eight were Jewish, they said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="3713">They said, "Arrest them."</sentence><sentence id="3714">And they were, all the doctors around Stalin were arrested a few days before he died.</sentence><sentence id="3715">And then, when this happened, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, too, they were looking for Jewish doctors or anybody who was, had anything to do with Zionists because they called them the Zionist conspiracy against Stalin and they found me at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3716">They had to, since this was a chain reaction, that went down.</sentence><sentence id="3717">So they found me and they told me to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that I am a Zionist this and Zionist that.</sentence><sentence id="3718">And Stalin died three days later and I mean, I was just heartbroken because it was before exams and all this and it was in March and I was ready to take my exams soon and then when everything died, died down, and the so-called Thaw, this is what they called it politically, the Thaw started, then they called me back and they said forget about the

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3771">Q: What, what happened with his work, with his career, did he remain on that committee after the communist takeover, or did he continue, you also mentioned that he went back to work for his former employer, did he continue to work for this former employer?</sentence><sentence id="3772">What became of his career?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3775">A: My father's former employers, either died or escaped in 1947 or 1948, to the West, so this, what I mentioned, was a volunteer work.</sentence><sentence id="3776">Everybody, basically, had to volunteer to do something.</sentence><sentence id="3777">This was volunteer work, he volunteered to be appointed to this position and this was not a paid job.</sentence><sentence id="3778">And it did not require a great deal of his time.</sentence><sentence id="3779">He immediately looked for some opportunity and started to work for a co-op, a lot of co-ops started and what co-ops were are a group of people who banded together and formed a what you would call a, maybe a small enterprise, as long as they worked under the ruse of a cooperation and everything was divided, the profit if there was any, and they paid their taxes to the state, this was what the communists considered kind of a happy in-between of <span class="DLF">state farms</span> or state enterprise and private enterprise.</sentence><sentence id="3780">Because private enterprise was phased out gradually, except in cases such as a shoe maker that, you know, repairs shoes, but even for that, eventually, they had co-ops, shoemaker co-ops or tailor co-ops or this, but a few, a few of those branches, that you could not really work any other way except in a co-op, but he was working for a <span class="BUILDING">co-op</span> where he rose eventually, he was a very smart man, and he rose to be kind of a midlevel manager, but also working and this co-op was working with a lot of women who would then get the merchandise and do it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3781">They were making shopping nets and shopping bags and things like that that anybody can do on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3782">And then they would bring it in and so actually they had a very, a very small <span class="REGION">area</span>, a very small base and just a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and he enjoyed this, he enjoyed it and he was very much liked.</sentence><sentence id="3783">The only problem he had occasionally is that they asked him, because he was such a good worker, and he received all kinds of awards that he didn't really want particularly because he was not very, you know, infatuated with the communist system, they always wanted him to join the Party because he was a perfect, what they called cadre, cadre, he comes from the working class, he was a hard-working man, he was an honest man, he rose from nothing to a midlevel manager, so he was an ideal person.</sentence><sentence id="3784">But he never joined, he always said, "No, absolutely no."</sentence><sentence id="3785">So that, he was such a good worker, they left him alone.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3817">A: Interestingly, with most people, you could talk politics.</sentence><sentence id="3818">You know, eventually, throughout these years, we isolated the ones who were suspicious to us and... because they were always eager beaver Party workers and give big speeches and some of them did big speeches and we knew that we can still talk to them, they're just careerists and they just want to go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="3819">But I would say the great majority, even in the worst days, we could still discuss things.</sentence><sentence id="3820">Obviously, we didn't do it on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, we didn't do it elsewhere except in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> where there was a lot of noise and they couldn't discern, you know, who says what.</sentence><sentence id="3821">So in this respect, we did not really have a kind of a prison atmosphere in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3822">And our professors, I would say eighty percent of them were very much against the regime and occasionally they let that go in very, you know, ambiguous statements.</sentence><sentence id="3823">We recognized it immediately and all this, but just to give you one example, most of us, we had to go to Russian instruction every day, most of us either didn't show up or if we did, we didn't listen, we didn't learn anything, and after going through <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, at the end you had to take a state exam.</sentence><sentence id="3824">And I, the exam in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time was you had to draw a written note on which you had a topic.</sentence><sentence id="3825">And you were given fifteen minutes to take notes on that topic from your memory, you were given a pencil and some paper, and when you were called upon, this was your turn and you could talk about, introduce your topic and there was a committee.</sentence><sentence id="3826">And I went to my Russian exam, and this happened to other people too, and I drew my topic and I couldn't even read the title, let alone, couldn't read the title, I just, in these years I just never bothered to read, to learn enough to read.</sentence><sentence id="3827">Today of course, I'm not very proud of this, because now I know that the more languages you speak, you know, the more lives you have, but those days, this was a political statement, they couldn't believe it, they just couldn't believe it because I was straight A in my subjects and so there was tremendous animosity toward me from the police, from the Party secretary and all the others.</sentence><sentence id="3828">Can we stop?</sentence><sentence id="3829">, Side B</sentence><sentence id="3831">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 72 Tape 7, Side A</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3852">A: Oh, the Russian exam.</sentence><sentence id="3853">And then I found out later that some of my classmates had the same problem and, eventually, they decided not to, not to have us back, so they just gave us a D and they were very angry about it.</sentence><sentence id="3854">But in a way it was their fault, too, because how could we get up to that point, going through all classes, didn't they realize that something is wrong?Well, this, I remember this very distinctly, that that was one way to show our reaction to what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3855">And otherwise, even the ones who were very active in the Communist Party, most of them always gave us a signal that this is all a show, there is nothing to worry about.</sentence><sentence id="3856">There were very few people.</sentence><sentence id="3857">So when I left the <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, at that time, you, I became a teacher and we were supposed to go to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>, they could not, you could not teach in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> the first year and I was then assigned to a little, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vacz</span>, from my mother's birthplace, only a few miles and taught there for a year.</sentence><sentence id="3858">And this was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of a minority, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> has very few minorities, but they have some Slovak minorities in the North, these were Slovaks and they speak, they spoke very little Hungarian, but they would not admit it because they were afraid that there would be repercussion, so they asked for a Hungarian teacher, they could have asked for a Slovak-speaking teacher, too.</sentence><sentence id="3859">And it was quite an experience, but it has nothing to do with being Jewish or with the Holocaust, none of that came up, it was just a totally different one.</sentence><sentence id="3860">And then after this year that I spent in... I made contact again, I wanted to get back with a youth organization and I found interestingly that the Communist Youth Organization, the Pioneer organization probably could use me because, I mean I went through the boy scouts, I went through the Zionists, | had some very definite ideas and I answered an ad and became a director of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3861">They looked for a young teacher who, I had about twelve other young teachers with me and it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, it was just a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">day camp</span>, and it turned out to be such a good experience that the local Communist Party secretary asked me if 1 would like to come and teach in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3862">And I said, "Naturally, this is it!""</sentence><sentence id="3863">And so I was transferred to, just to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and I taught there until the Revolution came and I escaped again.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3901">A: During the Revolution, they asked me to organize a Democratic Teacher's Union.</sentence><sentence id="3902">I was not a Party member, they knew that I was not also an anti-Party member either because, and this I wanted to bring out and emphasize, that as a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, you could never be truly an anti-communist because you knew one thing, as long as the Communist Party was in power, there would be no pogroms and your life is safe.</sentence><sentence id="3903">And this is what happened after communism, and communist fall, most of my relatives and friends who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, this was their greatest fear, that what will happen to them now.</sentence><sentence id="3904">And anti-Semitism is now rampant in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="3905">So this is just an interlude, I just wanted to say something about that.</sentence><sentence id="3906">So I was just teaching in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> and until the Revolution and as a, and during the Revolution, they sent for me and they wanted me to get the Democratic Teachers Union together, various democratic organizations, and all this.</sentence><sentence id="3907">And I came out to a couple of briefings with people, with the local council, the town council, the district council and one day there was some fighting out there and I saw a bunch of people with armbands, the Arrow Cross armbands.</sentence><sentence id="3908">And I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and all my desire to ever do anything or to stay there, just went away.</sentence><sentence id="3909">Right in that moment.</sentence><sentence id="3910">I realized that this is now when I have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="3911">Even though I had a very good life, the last three years, after I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, I had a very, very good life, relatively speaking, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3912">A good salary, I started to write for the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span>, the... stories about young people.</sentence><sentence id="3913">I ran <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and financially, and I got all the recognition and awards and all this, I couldn't complain.</sentence><sentence id="3914">But when I saw, when I saw that, the symbol, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said, "This is it.</sentence><sentence id="3915">I will never return except to visit."</sentence><sentence id="3916">And I told my parents, "In two weeks, I'm leaving."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3933">Q: Where did you, you mentioned that you had a, you had a real enthusiasm for working with young people and that seems to be something that you did for most of your adult life and at the time, what, where did your, where did that enthusiasm come from and what, what were you teaching, were you teaching them simply geography or were you trying to teach them a broader range of things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3935">A: Well, when I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, immediately I started to teach geography, they had these so-called <span class="BUILDING">pioneer houses</span>, these were <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where the kids can come back in the afternoon and depending on their interests, join groups, study groups.</sentence><sentence id="3936">And I was running the geography group which was a lot of introduction and simulations of how a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> is meandering and then old <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> is meandering, a lot of tests, hands-on type of activities.</sentence><sentence id="3937">I took them to hike and I taught them how, orientation in nature and all, everything that was romantic in the boy scouts.</sentence><sentence id="3938">And from this, I kind of organized a group of very enthusiastic kids who eventually would follow me anywhere, you know, and it appealed to me as a young, and I can still do that, and so then people saw this and they hired me to run big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3939">But I always neglected the political thing, that was not, I never really cared for the politics, but I emphasized the romantic thing.</sentence><sentence id="3940">I even wrote a book for the Pioneer movement and suggested a completely new uniform and emblems and all this, what kids love at that age, because the Pioneer uniform is the most, was the most impractical thing a child can have.</sentence><sentence id="3941">A white shirt, can you imagine, with dark blue pants and a red kerchief, I mean, and</sentence><sentence id="3943">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 74 nothing on it, they were not, they couldn't have any emblem anything, so I said, "No, a child wants to see his or her achievements, right there, he or she wants to show it to the world."</sentence><sentence id="3944">And so they were, they were giving me some free hand to do it and I did a lot of this, submitted it, it was accepted, so this is what I loved, that I could have some influence and push them away, mainly from politics, into romantic activities, you know, and that is the one, that is, I think that pleased me a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="3945">And eventually, it was a, I did it until the very last day, until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and I still corresponded with many of my kids who were in my group as adults.</sentence><sentence id="3946">And when I went back later on, ten years or fifteen years later, some of these kids were running the same kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and organizations and they always came and they said, "You know, if you had told us that in the middle of the night we have to leave our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> so that nobody will wake up and assemble in a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we would have been up there.</sentence><sentence id="3947">And we would have been following you all the way out to the <span class="DLF">border</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3948">I didn't tell them that I was leaving because I didn't want them to even have this silly idea, but after I left some of them learned about it and three of them came after me and ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, but eventually went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3949">So occasionally, when I am in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, I do bump into them and I go out and look up some, and those who were very nice to me, I always see.</sentence><sentence id="3950">I even see the Communist Party secretary, the woman who was influential to get me, I took my wife, too, to see her during the late "70s and early "80s, she and her husband, I just, they were good people.</sentence><sentence id="3951">They came from the old communist underground, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3952">And though we never talked about it, I'm sure they were just as disappointed in what happened to Marx ideas as most other people.</sentence><sentence id="3953">But they would never discuss it because they were too loyal to the Party.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3979">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3980">I was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> all the time because I believed that I have this, anybody, most Holocaust survivors have an intuition, have a, somehow, a sixth sense and we always wanted to read the crowd.</sentence><sentence id="3981">The mood of the crowd.</sentence><sentence id="3982">And so I was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> all the time, watching what's happening, kind of sensing the undercurrent.</sentence><sentence id="3983">I was like an animal and I knew that I knew exactly what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3984">And I knew that these people eventually could be up to no good or quite a few of them could be up to no good because, you know, the leopard doesn't lose its spots and even though it all started with great democratic slogans, eventually after two weeks, it did disintegrate and there were a lot of fascist groups and I did not want to live under <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span>, but I was glad, myself, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> came back.</sentence><sentence id="3985">I just didn't want to live under that system either, but at least it saved the lives of a lot of people because there were ugly incidents.</sentence><sentence id="3986">The Revolution started for two weeks, the first one week was kind of democratic and looked like democratic and the second week, just everything disintegrated and the crowd went berserk and I didn't trust any of that any more.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4280">A: Well, I realize that I was in a trap, because there was no way for me to go back to Europe, even if I wanted to, and be accepted by a... any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and get some legal status anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4281">The reason was, once you were placed in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you couldn't really do much about it any more.</sentence><sentence id="4282">So I knew I had to make the best of my stay here, but I certainly didn't want to stay in Saint Louis, because I was totally astonished at the prejudice in Saint Louis.</sentence><sentence id="4283">Not just against Blacks, but also against just about anyone.</sentence><sentence id="4284">I worked mainly, this is my fate, with German, it was a German company basically, a German family, German workers and I heard enough of... you cannot name a group or a race around the</sentence><sentence id="4286">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 81 world about whom they were not talking during the day, always in very derogatory terms.</sentence><sentence id="4287">And then I found out that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Louis</span> was a very Germanic city at that time.</sentence><sentence id="4288">You were either of German descent, or you were Black.</sentence><sentence id="4289">And luckily, when I became very, very upset about this, my Black fellow workers, first by sign language, probably, and later on, as I learned my English, pidgin English back then, they invited me on weekends to be...to go around with them, because they said one cannot just sit at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4290">And they introduced me to the Saint Louis that most people who were born there, probably, wouldn't know.</sentence><sentence id="4291">I went to just about every <span class="BUILDING">nightclub</span>, I heard just about every jazz band that there existed those days, that came to Saint Louis.</sentence><sentence id="4292">And many times, in a huge <span class="BUILDING">dance hall</span>, I was the only white face.</sentence><sentence id="4293">And of course, sometimes, I ran into almost trouble too, because of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4311">Q: Were you not... did it seem strange to you that it would be the group of Black co-workers, rather than Germanic co-workers who would befriend you, or did you think that that had anything to do with you being Jewish, or did you reject friendships with the German descent co-workers?</sentence><sentence id="4312">What was the story with that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4315">A: No, because most of those Germans were Jews, and... but that didn't prevent them from being prejudiced against me too, and they knew that they were... that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4316">It was just a general thing in Saint Louis, to look down on anyone who is not an established person.</sentence><sentence id="4317">And I felt this, everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4318">I just... and the situation at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, where I was staying with these people, was also not very happy.</sentence><sentence id="4319">And that, I think, contributed to my thoughts that, how nice it would be to go to some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4325">Q: So you came with some ideas about this being the Land of the Free, and did it surprise you to see how... what a division there was between Blacks and Whites in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the way that the White people treated Blacks, and the problems with equality?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4327">A: Yes, yes, that surprised me very, very much.</sentence><sentence id="4328">In one of these weekend excursions, I was introduced to a very charming college student, she was Black, and we started to date.</sentence><sentence id="4329">And eventually, she explained to me that we cannot see each other any more, because her life was in danger, and my life was in danger.</sentence><sentence id="4330">And she said, "You don't understand this now, but twenty years from now you will understand.</sentence><sentence id="4331">And as much as it hurts me, we have to stop seeing each other."</sentence><sentence id="4332">And that was my first great introduction to prejudice, really, on a personal, you know, basis.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4366">Q: How did you learn English?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4368">A: Well, when you are... this is my great argument against bilingual education, that when you have to, you learn everything.</sentence><sentence id="4369">You can learn Chinese probably, just as well as you learn English.</sentence><sentence id="4370">No, for Europeans, English is an easy language to learn.</sentence><sentence id="4371">Not so easy to write, but to learn, because it's... the grammar is much simpler than some European languages.</sentence><sentence id="4372">I just put my mind to it, and I decided, if I am here, I might as well do it.</sentence><sentence id="4373">I could have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>, for example, and live my life as a Hungarian, but I wanted to be integrated into the society, and I love the English language, that's the truth.</sentence><sentence id="4374">I think of all the languages, even though I admit that French is a very beautiful language to listen to, but I love the English language, I love... and this is why I love to read and I learned just by listening and my willpower, I think, helped me to get through.</sentence><sentence id="4375">And among all the people eventually I associated with, who arrived at the same time, I made the most progress, because I just decided I don't want to belong to any Hungarian club and I don't want anything to do with this.</sentence><sentence id="4376">I really want to learn English.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4886">A: 1961.</sentence><sentence id="4887">And, as I mentioned previously, the only job I could get here was... teaching mentally retarded students, but I didn't mind, because I thought of the old Hungarian proverb that said for any... for something that you like, you would even let people chop wood on your back, and I strongly believe in this.</sentence><sentence id="4888">And so, I just... I didn't really consider teaching these children a great deal different than teaching regular children.</sentence><sentence id="4889">As a matter of fact, in certain <span class="NPIP">aspects</span>, in certain sense, it was even easier because they were so loyal and devoted to you.</sentence><sentence id="4890">Naturally, there were some problems with emotionally disturbed kids, who were in this group, too.</sentence><sentence id="4891">But basically, it was easy, because of their love and devotion.</sentence><sentence id="4892">And I stayed in it for ten years, and after ten years, I honestly said to myself,</sentence><sentence id="4894">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 90 I'm burned out, I have nothing more to give, and this is when I returned to regulating...teaching so-called normal children, if there is such thing.</sentence><sentence id="4895">And my wife, yeah, I met my wife at a teacher's meeting, and our superiors, our administrators, were a rather strange bunch of people, who had sometimes very unreasonable requests, and it had nothing to do with education, such as we should have two pairs of shoes in our <span class="INT_SPACE">drawers</span>, so we would never have dusty shoes.</sentence><sentence id="4896">And saying this to people who had to go out in the <span class="DLF">playground</span> almost every hour, I mean it was strange.</sentence><sentence id="4897">And they criticized the way we dressed or what we said, or we looked, and they didn't much do it to me, but to... because I was a man, and I was the only man on the faculty of the county, but mainly to women.</sentence><sentence id="4898">And... so I met my wife and at that time she was married with three children.</sentence><sentence id="4899">And she struck me as a kind of a person who doesn't really want others to know much about her.</sentence><sentence id="4900">And I found out later there was a reason for that.</sentence><sentence id="4901">Then... and we just discussed things, and I in my mind said, "Oh, this lady's quite cold."</sentence><sentence id="4902">That was my first impression.</sentence><sentence id="4903">And never bothered really much.</sentence><sentence id="4904">But, our <span class="DLF">path</span> crossed at these meetings, and eventually, she was writing some kind of a publication for mentally retarded teachers, and she called me up, and...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4943">A: Yeah, and as I was saying, first, I was not really very impressed, because she was not very warm.</sentence><sentence id="4944">And then the relationship changed after her phone call, when she asked for some help, because I thought if a woman is really cold and reserved, she wouldn't call me and ask for help.</sentence><sentence id="4945">And so I called her back and we started to chat, and from there on, occasionally, we called each other.</sentence><sentence id="4946">But we never talked about personal things, and so, the whole thing kind of petered out.</sentence><sentence id="4947">And then, later, a year or two years later, I was invited to a party, and to one of our colleagues, and he said, "Oh, by the way, Jan got a divorce.</sentence><sentence id="4948">She is divorced, and she looks good."</sentence><sentence id="4949">And according to... excuse me... according to Jan, I said, "Wow," which I deny.</sentence><sentence id="4950">I never said such thing.</sentence><sentence id="4951">But anyway, this, or whatever I did, or said, they considered it some kind of a sign for me that I would like to see her.</sentence><sentence id="4952">So they invited her and kind of matched us together one evening, and we hit it off just right.</sentence><sentence id="4953">And from there on, I began to see her more often, and eventually, we just decided that this was a pretty serious relationship.</sentence><sentence id="4954">But I was thirty-seven, thirty-six and a bachelor, and I just was not going to get married without giving it some thought.</sentence><sentence id="4955">So, I did what my previous girlfriend did, and signed up for one year to go and teach for the Army in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4956">And I arrived there, and I spent a year in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and that year convinced me that yes, that she would be the right person for me, so I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4957">And we got married on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Tamalpais</span>, on the top of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Tamalpais</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> I loved to hike around, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> we both saw every day, coming and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5026">Q: What about Jan?</sentence><sentence id="5027">Did you talk with Jan about your much... in the early times of your getting to know each other, about your experiences during the Holocaust, and about just the Holocaust in general?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5030">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="5031">There is no problem there.</sentence><sentence id="5032">She really wanted to know everything and I told her everything.</sentence><sentence id="5033">And she read a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="5034">And, as a matter of fact, she is my police woman, because she doesn't allow me to watch anything concerning the Holocaust on television, because she says I have such nightmares that she doesn't want to wake me up and it just... too much trouble.</sentence><sentence id="5035">But I was amazed that after we got married, how much time she... and effort she spent, and energy in reading books on Jewish history, and then, of course, going into her favorite theme, cookbooks.</sentence><sentence id="5036">She has Jewish cookbooks and she knows more about Jewish cooking and holidays, and... so today when somebody ask me about some Jewish custom or holiday or something, I always refer them to her, because she knows a lot more about it than I do.</sentence><sentence id="5037">I just, because of my indifference to religion, I just never really give it too much thought, of learning much about holidays and the background, but she did.</sentence><sentence id="5038">And of course, there was never any question about conversion, anything like this, because I myself, I was not practicing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5048">Q: How... was her family accepting of you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5050">A: Yes, and the reason was, by the time we got married, the person who probably wouldn't have liked me, because he was a rabid anti-Semite, her father, was gone.</sentence><sentence id="5051">Her mother was a very tolerant person, but she was dead, too, by the time we got married.</sentence><sentence id="5052">So, the only relatives around that she had, was her brother and her sister, who are 20"-Century human beings, and they are very, very tolerant, and very progressive people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5056">Q: Okay, so you stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bay Area</span> until 1974, is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5060">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="5061">What did you think of... were you aware of what was going on with the... with the Summer of Love, and the Free Speech Movement and all that stuff that was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkeley</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> in the late sixties?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5066">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 93</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5067">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="5068">By the time I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bay Area</span>, and even before that, as soon as I could understand and speak some English, I became involved in the social and political scene very much.</sentence><sentence id="5069">For example, I remember when L... even before I settled in the <span class="REGION">Bay Area</span>, I would come up for the weekend and would go down, just by myself, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Beach</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">beatnik coffeehouses</span>, and just listen, or converse sometimes with people.</sentence><sentence id="5070">I really enjoyed the beatnik era.</sentence><sentence id="5071">I liked those people, they were very introspective and intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="5072">There was kind of a subdued, refined attitude about them that I appreciated.</sentence><sentence id="5073">Occasionally, when somebody played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, they were sipping the coffee and philosophizing, just a great time, I think, for literature, poetry reading.</sentence><sentence id="5074">They were all part of the scene.</sentence><sentence id="5075">That truly was an interesting chapter in my life, going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">North Beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5076">Then, later on, of course, after we were married, after I came back from Europe, from my one-year stint with the Army, which was in 1966, that is when everything started, especially the Vietnam War flared up.</sentence><sentence id="5077">And our family was very much involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="5078">We were going over to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and I remember making big signs.</sentence><sentence id="5079">My wife joined the Another Mother for Peace movement.</sentence><sentence id="5080">We were demonstrating, and there was a very cute episode that happened to us.</sentence><sentence id="5081">She usually sewed a lot for herself and for the children, and bought a very nice, flowery material to make a dress.</sentence><sentence id="5082">And we went to a big demonstration over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkeley</span>, and had to make our own signs.</sentence><sentence id="5083">And we were getting the signs ready and all of a sudden, we look down on our youngest son, Kevin's sign, and what did we see?</sentence><sentence id="5084">A beautiful flower, of some textile, and if we looked at it, then we realized it was her dress material that she had bought.</sentence><sentence id="5085">He was so fascinated by the pattern, and he needed flowers, because that was the theme of the demonstration, you had to have flowers on your signs, that he didn't think twice, and he was cutting out the flowers from... what... we didn't know what to do about it, and then we decided just to talk to him, that this was not really the proper thing to do, but he didn't get punished.</sentence><sentence id="5086">So that was <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5087">My sister-in-law wrote to, for example, to Lyndon Johnson and told him that she fears that he should not run again.</sentence><sentence id="5088">And interestingly, about three days later, he came out and he announced that he would not run.</sentence><sentence id="5089">So that... we felt that the family can take some credit for that decision.</sentence><sentence id="5090">But, we, we tried to have our children go and learn a lot about the times where we lived in, because we realized that they were very exciting times, very unique times.</sentence><sentence id="5091">And perhaps, I always thought later on in their lives, life will be much duller than it was back then.</sentence><sentence id="5092">We also lived, by that time, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inverness</span>, in an <span class="REGION">area</span> that was in the center of all these cults, and rock bands and so the kids were exposed to all these people and spent sometimes days, just listening to their music, up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5093">It had advantages, it had disadvantages.</sentence><sentence id="5094">The disadvantage in this respect was that, no matter what parents would say to their children, they always had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and because these rock groups had open <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, you could help yourself at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fridge</span>, or whatever, eating, or no matter how young you were, you were also welcome to dip into the pot and smoke it.</sentence><sentence id="5095">And so it was in a... in the sense, difficult.</sentence><sentence id="5096">And many of our children in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, were runaways.</sentence><sentence id="5097">They would occasionally run away because that was just the style.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5129">Q: During that time, did you... were you aware of how Americans in general thought about the Holocaust and Holocaust survivors, and some of the stereotypes that were attached to them?</sentence><sentence id="5130">And did you think of yourself as a Holocaust survivor, and how were you... how</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5135">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 94 were you relating to the culture at large, in terms of that kind of identity?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5136">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="5137">Now that is a very surprising question, because | never really thought about it, but as you were asking me, I realize I didn't really think much about myself any more, as a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="5138">I just thought much as a member of the scene, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="5139">I was more involved in what is happening in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and thought more about it day by day, than to think too much, to give too much thought about the past.</sentence><sentence id="5140">So, in this respect, it was good, because one should not constantly be visited by ghosts.</sentence><sentence id="5141">So I think it, it was a good thing for me, in this respect.</sentence><sentence id="5142">And you know, I was part of the whole story then, and, rather, an American fighting to end the war, and bring justice to people who were oppressed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5150">Q: But you did have nightmares about the past, you mentioned that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5152">A: Only... only it usually... it was provoked by watching some television story, or reading something in the newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="5153">Otherwise, they were going away, they were becoming distant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5156">Q: What about when you lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and you're... you're there in this <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> that had perpetrated these crimes, and people presumably were much more aware of the history there, than your acquaintances had been when you lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5157">Was it a bigger issue that The Holocaust?</sentence><sentence id="5158">Was it more of a... did it have more of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in your life and did you talk about it with people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5162">A: The... now, this is a very complex story.</sentence><sentence id="5163">When we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which was from 1974 to 1993, I would say most of the time, when there was a <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>, the Holocaust was not a big problem, mainly because the West Germans were bringing it into the open.</sentence><sentence id="5164">It was not something hushed up under the rug.</sentence><sentence id="5165">There were discussions about it in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5166">I spoke about it to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students, mainly.</sentence><sentence id="5167">The whole... the whole problem with the Holocaust and the way Germans would look at it, really started after the Unification.</sentence><sentence id="5168">Now, I must also say that there weren't too many people who were alive in World War IL, by this time.</sentence><sentence id="5169">Because I was fifteen when the war ended, and I am seventy now, almost.</sentence><sentence id="5170">And so, most people are dead, who were in World War II.</sentence><sentence id="5171">Now of course, it doesn't mean that Fascism as such, is dead, or was even... was dead.</sentence><sentence id="5172">Yes, I heard anti-Semitic remarks, and sometimes, when I felt that it was the proper thing to do, I responded, and sometimes when I looked at the person, and I realize it was a primitive old idiot, there was no reason to say anything.</sentence><sentence id="5173">It would have been totally superfluous to provoke anything, because it wouldn't have made any difference.</sentence><sentence id="5174">I rather concentrated on talking to people of the middle and the younger generation.</sentence><sentence id="5175">And I found that intellectually, at least, they understood what was the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5176">They were very ashamed and sorry about it, and I felt no urge to drill in, with young people especially.</sentence><sentence id="5177">I felt that they were progressive enough.</sentence><sentence id="5178">The younger German generation amazed me, because I think they are very progressive, and I think they see history in the right light.</sentence><sentence id="5179">How... all this changed after the unification, because you had now <span class="REGION">Eastern Germany</span></sentence><sentence id="5181">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0467 &amp; RG-50.549.05*0001 95 joining.</sentence><sentence id="5182">A <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was never taught proper history, where the Holocaust, oh well, only West Germans were responsible for the Holocaust, because all the Nazis, according to <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>, were in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5183">So, those people had no background, and they had... they were not prepared for this historical fact and they denied it.</sentence><sentence id="5184">And this is why the skinhead movement and all the neo-Fascist organizations, basically, come from, <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>, even today.</sentence><sentence id="5185">Add to this the usual reasons for Fascism and anti-Semitism, a very high unemployment and very bad economic conditions and the fact that unification didn't bring immediate remedies to all their problems.</sentence><sentence id="5186">So they had to again go back and blame the old scapegoat, the Jews, in spite of the fact that there aren't too many.</sentence><sentence id="5187">So, since they couldn't attack many who are living among them, they went back to the past.</sentence></p></dialogue>
