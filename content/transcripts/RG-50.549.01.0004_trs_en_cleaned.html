<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: In the beginning we were together and it was also with many other Czech families.</sentence><sentence id="223">I just remember it was just very sad.</sentence><sentence id="224">I used to see people get hit.</sentence><sentence id="225">I know we were hungry almost all the time, and it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="226">There were soldiers and I really didn't understand what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="227">We had to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting for things and every once in a while my mom took us.</sentence><sentence id="228">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the doctor to look at us and I remember the very first time, especially because Rene -- I always felt he was a crybaby and I was afraid that he was going to cry, and I knew that if he cried something terrible might happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="229">I went first and to be examined and I was -- I didn't utter a sound.</sentence><sentence id="230">The whole time I kept hoping that Rene was going to be good too, because I didn't want anything to happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="231">So, we went with our mother.</sentence><sentence id="232">I also -- before we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I remember there was one time where I remember we sat with our mother and we were being photographed, and I remember that particular moment.</sentence><sentence id="233">As it turns out we subsequently learned those were actually propaganda photographs that were sent out, and Ihave the picture today of Rene, my mother and I in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: What was it about that moment that makes you remember?</sentence><sentence id="247">Is there anything particular about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Well, we were kind of like on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">I think they kept saying smile, but we really didn't feel much like it, but what I remember was being like close to my mother, feeling her coat and just the closeness of her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: But you could not stay together for very long?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: No, at some point -- I know now it was six months afterwards we were separated from our mother.</sentence><sentence id="257">I remember it as being physically really taken from her, and I definitely remember a scream from her and I remember her getting hit by a soldier or some person and I just remember really -- it was very, very sad.</sentence><sentence id="258">I just somehow knew I'd never see her again.</sentence><sentence id="259">Well, in fact that is what happened because the entire lager was killed that night, and also not only was I separated from my mom, but then Rene and I were also separated because we were -- though we were twins, we were of the opposite sex, so they didn't keep twins of the opposite sex together.</sentence><sentence id="260">So, Rene was put in with twin boys, and I went in with the twin girls.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Did you know where he was?</sentence><sentence id="267">Were you aware of him being there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: I think throughout the whole time that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I always felt in my heart that Rene was okay.</sentence><sentence id="271">I had a vague idea where he was.</sentence><sentence id="272">It was from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> it was a little over to the right near some <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> or something, and in fact he really was there.</sentence><sentence id="273">That's how I remember it.</sentence><sentence id="274">There was once some kind of a fire and I was terribly scared that Rene's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> may be caught up in that, but luckily he wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="277"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.01*0004 5</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: Did you see him sometimes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: Well, I don't recall that I saw him, although Rene says that he did once catch a glimpse of me, so, it's possible that I saw him too, but it didn't quite register for me.</sentence><sentence id="290">But somehow I always knew at some point no matter what this was, and I didn't understand what any of this was, that we'd somehow be together again.</sentence><sentence id="291">You asked earlier about memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I guess most of them are really quite bad and I don't like speaking of them very much and I haven't spoken about some at all and I might never because I can't.</sentence><sentence id="292">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the things that I remember very clearly is having to stand for hours for roll call, and I remember that I was one of the youngest and I was little and I always tried to hide behind somebody else, somebody taller so that I would not be seen.</sentence><sentence id="293">I think this was my mode of operation, is to be invisible and you can't get into trouble.</sentence><sentence id="294">I used to get a piece of bread, usually int he morning, with some black stuff to drink and I remember that I would always, since I was always -- maybe it was in the afternoon -- because I was always hungriest in the morning so I thought it would be really clever for me to try to save this piece of bread so I would have it the next day and of course it usually was gone and I didn't understand it but now in retrospect I think the rats and mice at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> must have loved me.</sentence><sentence id="295">They knew who to come to.</sentence><sentence id="296">I remember standing in <span class="DLF">line</span>, humiliated standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the cold naked waiting to get into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and also terribly scared because somehow I knew that you didn't always come out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">I didn't know quite what happened, but I knew you didn't always come back.</sentence><sentence id="298">I'm amazed at my, I guess call it chutzpa, because I had a locket on my neck, a gold locket from my mom and I was determined to hang on to this and of course if they had seen it, I don't know what would happened to me, but I took it off my neck and held on to in my hand and somehow got passed the guard.</sentence><sentence id="299">I think what happened is in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> it finally dropped out of my hand.</sentence><sentence id="300">But there was a little bit of me that said I got away -- I saved my locket.</sentence><sentence id="301">I remember once that I actually hid among dead bodies and I don't know exactly what was going on but I thought if I really lay still and make believe I was dead I would somehow escape whatever was happening.</sentence><sentence id="302">There was always this cloud of smoke in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and there was always this smell that after a while I heard comments you know they're burning people.</sentence><sentence id="303">It's flesh burning.</sentence><sentence id="304">I don't think I still understood exactly.</sentence><sentence id="305">I said, you know, it couldn't be.</sentence><sentence id="306">I think my most horrendous memories are those of Doctor Mengala and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I seemed to be a favorite candidate.</sentence><sentence id="307">I don't know why but I remember getting injections and I remember having some little surgeries here and there, and things with electrical wires.</sentence><sentence id="308">I spent a lot of time in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">I was pretty sick very often, but somehow I held on because I knew that Rene needed me.</sentence><sentence id="310">I had to get by.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: How did you know it was Doctor Mengele?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: Oh, I don't really think I really knew.</sentence><sentence id="336">I think I know that today.</sentence><sentence id="337">It was just a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="338">It just seemed like he was in charge.</sentence><sentence id="339">I mean to me he was like in charge of everything, next to God.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: You were alone there from your family, but did you relate to other women?</sentence><sentence id="346">Do you</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="381">I also know that twin girls also had camaraderie because they had their siblings.</sentence><sentence id="382">But I think my overwhelming sense was just loneliness.</sentence><sentence id="383">I felt that I was just alone, always all alone and didn't belong anywhere.</sentence></p></dialogue>

but it seemed that it was really just a temporary arrangement and they were trying to place me.</sentence><sentence id="851">There was a family that was interested in me, but they wanted to try me out.</sentence><sentence id="852">So, I was invited to spend shobot with them, and they had a little girl that was about a year younger than me and a boy.</sentence><sentence id="853">He must have been about four or five years younger than me.</sentence><sentence id="854">I spent Shobot there and I was very uncomfortable the whole time.</sentence><sentence id="855">They thought that I would be a good playmate for their daughter.</sentence><sentence id="856">There was only one problem.</sentence><sentence id="857">I didn't know how to play.</sentence><sentence id="858">I had never played.</sentence><sentence id="859">She had lots of games, lots of dolls.</sentence><sentence id="860">I really didn't know what to do with this stuff and I was again, I was very introverted, very quiet, not at all talkative, not at all bubbly.</sentence><sentence id="861">It just happens that the little boy also came with me for that Shobot and he was exactly the opposite of me.</sentence><sentence id="862">He was extraverted, bubbly, cute, a child anybody would want.</sentence><sentence id="863">So, when they brought us back, I guess they must have told these people that well, I didn't quite work out, but they'd be very interested in the little boy.</sentence><sentence id="864">So, that is what in fact happened.</sentence><sentence id="865">So the search was on to find me a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I think at that time, I did tell Eva Best, who was the woman, that I had a twin brother.</sentence><sentence id="866">Her husband, who was at that time the director of Rescue Children, started making inquiries.</sentence><sentence id="867">They also found a wonderful, wonderful family who had originally wanted to adopt a boy and were thinking that they were going to get Charlie who when they were told that the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they thought was for me didn't quite work out, would they be interested in a girl.</sentence><sentence id="868">It seems now that she has a twin brother, would they be interested.</sentence><sentence id="869">So, this was more than they ever anticipated or expected, but they said certainly.</sentence><sentence id="870">We'll be happy to take them.</sentence><sentence id="871">And they did come to see me and they had seen me and they knew that I was introverted and shy.</sentence><sentence id="872">I never said hello to them.</sentence><sentence id="873">I never looked at them.</sentence><sentence id="874">It didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="875">They were up to the challenge.</sentence><sentence id="876">So, very shortly after that, Eva Best took me over to Mr. and Mrs. Myer Slatkin who eventually adopted me and Rene, but that's a whole story, but I was not happy in the beginning because again, I felt like I had been given away again.</sentence><sentence id="877">This was the Polish woman.</sentence><sentence id="878">It was the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, it was the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and now it was this woman.</sentence><sentence id="879">It seemed like nobody really wanted me and I only wanted to keep going back to Eva Best and I know that my mom though, she tried real hard.</sentence><sentence id="880">She bought me things.</sentence><sentence id="881">She tried to get me involved in going shopping and things, but I only wanted to go back to Eva Best.</sentence><sentence id="882">It took quite a long time before I got really used to being with them.</sentence><sentence id="883">I continued in the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and they were exceptionally loving to me.</sentence><sentence id="884">I started in the third grade in I think December and I think by March and April I was in fifth grade with children my age.</sentence><sentence id="885">To the credit of my mom who worked really hard with me on English.</sentence><sentence id="886">Hebrew I was on my own because she didn't know Hebrew, but I seemed to have done well.</sentence><sentence id="887">In fact, I excelled at Hebrew and they had a lot of patience.</sentence><sentence id="888">Slowly, slowly, I realized that this was going to be my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and when they heard that I had a brother they right away got busy looking for him and they spared absolutely no expense and believe me, lucky they had it, but they spent thousands of dollars to find Rene and to be finally able to get him here.</sentence><sentence id="889">But the one thing all through this is nobody ever asked me "What happened to you?"</sentence><sentence id="890">Nobody ever
