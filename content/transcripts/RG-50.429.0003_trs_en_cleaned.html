<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: And no feeling of being different because you were Jewish or anti-Semitism or anything like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: No feeling of that sort whatsoever, the, the sports were mixed with the religion.</sentence><sentence id="18">The sports were mixed with <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">The sports were mixed with music.</sentence><sentence id="20">The <span class="DLF">ports</span> were mixed with whatever activity was going on in, among our small group and for that reason I think we got along very well..</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Were sports an opportunity for everybody to be together and get to know each other?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: It is, itis an opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="28">Sports is a way in which you can get to know each other, in which you can um be happy together, be distressed together when nec, when it happens.</sentence><sentence id="29">To understand more about the Catholic religion, the Protestant religion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> which serves its clientele and it was our responsibility, my mother and father taught us to be together and uh it was, it was a fine, it was a fine way to do it and my father had a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> everyone needs nails and screws, hammers, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lawn mowers</span>, it doesn't matter what religion you are, if you need a tool, you need a tool and so I learned a lot about the exchange of information, exchange of equipment tools, um how to make keys, how to fix locks, um 1-o-c-k-s. How to prepare uh door checks, how to prepare things that needed repair that my father had taken in for repair and I was taught how to participate un that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: So it sounds like to me that you were an all American boy.</sentence><sentence id="34">You weren't necessarily just from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">I mean your identification was just...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="39">A: Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="40">I've oh I've never felt either on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> or the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, or with one collect, connection or another connection.</sentence><sentence id="41">I felt that we were together, our group was together and we had a lot to enjoy together.</sentence><sentence id="42">And it did occur.</sentence><sentence id="43">Many of the young people in, in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were admitted as students at <span class="BUILDING">Boys High School</span>, which was I have to say it, a very elite tough <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where you had to work very, very hard to remain to succeed and to get ready for <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Tell me a little bit about your sports activity, what you liked, how good were you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Uh in my younger years there was no such thing as a little league baseball or Babe Ruth league baseball.</sentence><sentence id="55">Uh fourteen managers and 26 assistant managers uh and somebody in charge of the Pepsi cola and someone in charge of, of something else.</sentence><sentence id="56">There, there wasn't that kind of uh relationship that uh the grouping was, was not hard and in that way um my parents were aware of and permitted my participation in sports so I had to balance out the hours I spent in sports with the hours I gave to sports.</sentence><sentence id="57">And um it was uh a good way I think for me to learn um importance of earning a living how different ways exist for earning a living.</sentence><sentence id="58">And uh participating in certain projects regardless of what background you come from religiously.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: What sports did you like?</sentence><sentence id="65">how did you get started?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Uh well one way in which you get started I guess is by having things close to hand.</sentence><sentence id="69">My father had a <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span> but it also had a sporting goods branch to it and so I was allowed to go pick out a pair of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ice skates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">I was allowed to pick out a pair of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller skates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">I was allowed to pick out a brand new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basketball</span> and go with a team to a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> to play.</sentence><sentence id="72">I was allowed to uh pick for myself and my Dad sold many of those sporting good items but it wasn't pushing me into sports in order to sell a few more gloves, a few more bats, a few more balls, not at all.</sentence><sentence id="73">And my Dad liked them very much too and that's why it was such a surprise to me when I played baseball in the Canadian American league, professional baseball on opening day when um the team I was playing with the Rome Colonels, Rome New York Colonels, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity that no one really ever gets automatically.</sentence><sentence id="74">And that was my father coming secretly and I don't mean secretly in a secret, secretive sense but in a personnel sense.</sentence><sentence id="75">He got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he came up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, didn't let me know, stood behind the <span class="DLF">dugout</span> watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome Colonels, watched his son play.</sentence><sentence id="76">After the game was over had dinner with his son, and a couple of his son's friends from the team and after dinner he got back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> to his <span class="BUILDING">hardware store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">Kind of a homey sequence but that's what he did.</sentence><sentence id="78">And uh most of...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Followed your career.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: That, that started it yes.</sentence><sentence id="93">And as a handball player, tennis player, um I never had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">golf clubs</span>, we never had that kind of money to fill out all the sporting goods that exist.</sentence><sentence id="94">But that was one, that was one way to do it and the competition that came from sports relationship angles uh was very important kind of experience for me.</sentence><sentence id="95">Because I, I learned to live with the competition, to lose when I had to lose without crying about it.</sentence><sentence id="96">To win when I could win with joyousness and to share with my teammates other, other kinds of experiences.</sentence><sentence id="97">The last thing I would say in this regard is that that may have been the reason why when Little League did start in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> I started it.</sentence><sentence id="98">And got the teams together uh got the, the parents together, got it, got it started and then we went off to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">I 4</sentence><sentence id="101">5 played catcher for <span class="BUILDING">Boys High School</span> and then catcher for <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">I was on <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> when I was selected for the Olympic team.</sentence><sentence id="103">Um.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: .. how you really got into baseball, did you love it, how good were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Well I was it was not a great competitor.</sentence><sentence id="120">I was a good competitor.</sentence><sentence id="121">I was fair.</sentence><sentence id="122">I worked hard at it.</sentence><sentence id="123">I had all the moves necessary.</sentence><sentence id="124">I was a catcher very early and being a catcher eliminates a lot of people from vying for that role.</sentence><sentence id="125">How to hold your hand, how to make sure that the fingers are in such a position that when you, when you went to the minor leagues you didn't get whacked and have your fingers broken there or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">And so it was an attempt to be able to scoop the ball, learn how to scoop it without injuring your fingers and that took some doing.</sentence><sentence id="127">Um so my sports really came from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> from being a catcher at <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">And the Olympic tryouts were held in 3 <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>, in <span class="REGION">western state</span> Michigan College and in the <span class="REGION">Baltimore area</span> and there were hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying for the spots.</sentence><sentence id="130">There were 21 <span class="NPIP">places</span> on the Olympic team, 21.</sentence><sentence id="131">And there were maybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying for that, those 21 <span class="NPIP">spots</span> and I was a catcher selected uh by the coaches for the Olympic team from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>, from the east coast tryouts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: You must have been pretty good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Uh I worked hard at it, I worked hard at it.</sentence><sentence id="148">I knew what I was doing and uh wanted to be a catcher right from the beginning and catching is so hard and so difficult and uh it, it's one of the positions in sports where injuries are more likely to happen because of the close activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat and your fingers don't always give that much.</sentence><sentence id="149">Um and so I went off to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, went off to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span>, became an athlete on the Brooklyn college team, went to the Olympic tryouts, was selected for it uh and then had my chance very happily with meeting up with Hank Greenberg, the uh first baseman of the Detroit tigers who that year was being shifted from first base to <span class="DLF">outfield</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">Uh and I talked to him about some things that were going on that I felt needed adjustment and he gave prompt attention to what he thinks he, what he thought he could do.</sentence><sentence id="151">And he did some things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">team</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: ...go back to the Olympics.</sentence><sentence id="158">While you were playing baseball in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and at <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, were you ever thinking in terms of Olympics?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Never.</sentence><sentence id="162">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> you couldn't hope and dream for something that didn't exist, there were no Olympics in the baseball area, there just weren't any.</sentence><sentence id="163">It was track and <span class="DLF">field</span> where Johnny Woodruff participated, sprinters, jumpers, runners, uh long distance athletes uh you can think about it.</sentence><sentence id="164">You can dream about it and you can measure yourself uh side by side with other athletes and begin to think of your own chances and you try for it and you shoot for it and by shooting for it and 5</sentence><sentence id="166">6 at some of the materials that um may become available to you, you will see that uh I worked very, very hard to try to get that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: What you're saying is that while you were playing baseball in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> it hadn't occurred to you that you might be going to the Olympics.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Never.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: ...complete thought.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: What, what I could say is that the uh thinking about playing in the Olympics as a specific activity compared with uh playing baseball with a semi pro team with a neighborhood team, with a college team, far differed and thinking of playing baseball in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, uh and getting a bid to be on the team, all of which were helpful, um and I was lucky to be one of those selected and as I said they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford</span>, <span class="REGION">western state Michigan</span> and the <span class="REGION">Baltimore area</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Did a coach or somebody at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> suggest that you go to these tryouts.</sentence><sentence id="183">How did this come about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Uh the coach at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> uh at which I, I earned a silver medal in baseball when I was very young, 16, 17 years of age um kept pushing just said go ahead, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.</sentence><sentence id="187">Uh yes he wanted me to, to keep trying out.</sentence><sentence id="188">Um I gave more energy.</sentence><sentence id="189">I spent more time in practice I worked harder with my teammates.</sentence><sentence id="190">And um when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>, there were 2,300 athletes in the competition.</sentence><sentence id="191">And uh you were tried in all the <span class="NPIP">positions</span>, sliding, hitting um throwing.</sentence><sentence id="192">Uh doubling, triple activities.</sentence><sentence id="193">Uh all of which I knew something about...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">(end first tape)</sentence></p><p><sentence id="195">(Tape 2 of 3)</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: ...for over a month.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: How did exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics come about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Are you ready for the answer now.</sentence><sentence id="201">Exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics really started because there was an American committee on baseball that was pushing very hard for baseball to be introduced and attached to the Olympics.</sentence><sentence id="202">The uh number of baseball players in the world were limited pretty much to Central American teams, to all the American teams of course, South African teams uh the kinds of athletes who got started early through films, through television and began to play at a very early age.</sentence><sentence id="203">It really got introduced because 6</sentence><sentence id="205">7 frankly and I don't take this as a compliment for myself, because of Herman Goldberg who was in charge of developing baseball in the country of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: I want to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Please.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: So the United States Olympic committee decided that they were going to try to promote baseball.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="218">A; They were going to try to promote it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Who came to this decision?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Judge J. L. Hoffman of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> was the one who headed the group that pushed very hard for baseball to be an Olympic sport.</sentence><sentence id="223">Also the American Olympic committee wanted to see baseball in the Olympics.</sentence><sentence id="224">They had seen uh ski jumping; they had seen all the other sports and they really wanted to see baseball in there and it came about because the committee of the various sports, finally agreed that it would be a good thing for American baseball to be on the calendar and as far as I can tell that's when it started because I began to get mail.</sentence><sentence id="225">I began to get the first uh pieces of information about the possibility of a baseball tournament being held.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: And so it must have been pretty exciting to be in this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: It was very exciting because well first of all the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> was very large.</sentence><sentence id="233">125,000 people watching a baseball series, unheard of, unheard of before.</sentence><sentence id="234">Most of the baseball teams in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 maybe but 125,000 who ever heard of such a thing.</sentence><sentence id="235">You heard of it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for the first time and it was promoted by the small group of 28 baseball players.</sentence><sentence id="236">There were 28 of us assigned to play a series of exhibitions against each other and then go out into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and demonstrate baseball to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, to <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>, to many German institutions, how it's played uh what the difference is between baseball and soccer, uh what the rules were.</sentence><sentence id="237">How the umpires played, played the game.</sentence><sentence id="238">Um it was done um because of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I was very proud to be a part of the group that kept pushing without pushing.</sentence><sentence id="239">We kept encouraging, encouraging, demonstrating.</sentence><sentence id="240">This is how left handed first basemen behave, this is how right handed pitchers do this.</sentence><sentence id="241">If you are left handed this is how it's done.</sentence><sentence id="242">And um we, we put it on the map.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: What was the reaction when you were playing these games in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>?</sentence><sentence id="255">What was the audience reaction?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: The audience reaction was very poor, very poor.</sentence><sentence id="259">They didn't like the game, they didn't know the game.</sentence><sentence id="260">The <span class="DLF">diamond</span>, the <span class="DLF">baseball diamond</span> was never laid out 7</sentence><sentence id="262">8 like a diamond.</sentence><sentence id="263">They took a four inch white silky tape and they pressed it into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">And they made a, a, a uh diamond out of it for baseball.</sentence><sentence id="265">But they never actually made a <span class="DLF">baseball field</span>, never.</sentence><sentence id="266">It caught hold to some extent, not to such extent as in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, especially <span class="REGION">central America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">But it became a vivid activity because it came from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">A lot of the kids wanted very much to know more about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and the sports were very important to them too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: But the audience was not excited.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: The audience was not excited because the pace of baseball much slower than soccer.</sentence><sentence id="285">In soccer the, the ball is moving, moving, moving, moving, moving all the time and the kids are kicking you, and they're kicking you, they're kicking you and they're circling and they're beating out the other guy whereas in the the sports you play hard or you jump hard, you, you run hard.</sentence><sentence id="286">You do all of the things yourself, but in baseball you're part of a team.</sentence><sentence id="287">And it's necessary to uh understand that and uh the crowds on the <span class="DLF">baseball field</span> were 100,000?</sentence><sentence id="288">not 125,000</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: ...the period before you went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">How much did you know at that time about what was going on in Nazi Germany?</sentence></p></dialogue>
