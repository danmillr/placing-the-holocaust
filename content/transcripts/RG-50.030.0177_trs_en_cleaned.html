<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Would you please tell me your name, how you were born, your birth name, and when and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Bertna Belle Pasternak.</sentence><sentence id="4">Now, my name is Bernard.</sentence><sentence id="5">It went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belle</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martimorish</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="8">It's in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span>, when <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was there it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vishosimos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">And also, they called that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Feldesisho</span> because the Hungarians were there.</sentence><sentence id="11">The <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was born was surrounded with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> around.</sentence><sentence id="12">We had high peaks of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> over there which there was snow almost all year around.</sentence><sentence id="13">About September the snow melted, something like this and then a month later the snow came back.</sentence><sentence id="14">The <span class="REGION">area</span> was a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> surrounded with water.</sentence><sentence id="15">We had water.</sentence><sentence id="16">We had everything over there.</sentence><sentence id="17">We were there, approximately a few thousand Jews.</sentence><sentence id="18">There was a few thousand Germans and also a few thousands Rumanians and Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="19">We all had <span class="REGION">areas</span>, different <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">The Jews had their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">The Rumanians the other <span class="NPIP">quarter</span>, the Germans the other <span class="NPIP">quarter</span> and the Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="22">The Germans were not the same type of Germans as in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">They all speak German, but they call them Sipser (ph), a Shwab, some kind of a Shwab name.</sentence><sentence id="24">There was a lot of them, and we all understand each other and we got along great.</sentence><sentence id="25">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span>, as a matter of fact, the Jewish life was so great over there that on Friday, we had a whistle blowing when the Shobot comes, three times.</sentence><sentence id="26">The first whistle meant close the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">The second whistle meant you should be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by now, and the third one to light candles.</sentence><sentence id="28">That was the greatest thing to happen.</sentence><sentence id="29">We also had a there which children were coming from all around learning and that by us.</sentence><sentence id="30">We had five <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">They named them number one, number three, number four and five.</sentence><sentence id="32">We also had about four or five <span class="BUILDING">shulls</span>, and we all belonged to different <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">Everybody had a different way to go wherever he wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="34">We were assigned to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> number one which it was I would say about a half a mile.</sentence><sentence id="35">The <span class="REGION">area</span> there -- there was no transportation like you have over here.</sentence><sentence id="36">We walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wasn't so bad to walk except there were hills when you got to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="38">Also there was another system too over there.</sentence><sentence id="39">We went to Hebrew in the morning until 9:30, from 7:00 until about 9:30.</sentence><sentence id="40">At 9:30 we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Romanian school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">We had lunch a little bit, about a half an hour, and then in the afternoon until 4:00.</sentence><sentence id="42">4:00 we went back to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> until about 8:00.</sentence><sentence id="43">Now, what did we do over there all this time, you know, with the children when they're grown up?</sentence><sentence id="44">Industrial life, there was only how should I say, <span class="BUILDING">wood factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">We had a lot of wood.</sentence><sentence id="46">All the time, when the Hungarians were before the First World War, and the Austrian life was very beautiful over there, very great.</sentence><sentence id="47">On the beginning on the 18th century, the beginning of the 18th century, the first Jew came over from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">He settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martimorish</span> because there wasn't such a good life there so they kept on coming and coming.</sentence><sentence id="49">They settled.</sentence><sentence id="50">But after the Romanians took over, after the first world war, the Romanians took over and life turned sour because the Rumanians didn't need any wood and there was no other industry so it wasn't so great for everybody over there.</sentence><sentence id="51">Their lives started to be very poor, but what we grew over there and the</sentence><sentence id="53"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, there was potatoes, beans, corns, so almost everybody had a little <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">We stored away the food for the wintertime.</sentence><sentence id="55">We put it in <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span>, whoever had <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> and we kept on going day by day.</sentence><sentence id="56">We had no telephone of course.</sentence><sentence id="57">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> and things like this.</sentence><sentence id="58">It was like in the early 1900 century.</sentence><sentence id="59">It didn't change much, the life.</sentence><sentence id="60">There was a lot of poor people in the <span class="REGION">area</span> also because I came from a five sisters and two brothers, but most of the families were much larger, and it was not easy to keep up so many people to feed the people.</sentence><sentence id="61">The father only had the work over there.</sentence><sentence id="62">The mothers over there, like the Jewish mothers, they always took care of their children.</sentence><sentence id="63">They were trying to do the best they can to see that everybody is nourished the right way and lived the right way.</sentence><sentence id="64">But there were other kinds of things over there, the life was very harsh, the way it happened there.</sentence><sentence id="65">It started with beatings.</sentence><sentence id="66">No matter what you do, you got a beating.</sentence><sentence id="67">You went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hadre</span>, you didn't know the thing, you got a beating.</sentence><sentence id="68">You walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, if there was an older man and you didn't give him the right of way, he give you a beating.</sentence><sentence id="69">You went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which the principal from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, his name was Hugar.</sentence><sentence id="70">He was standing in the <span class="DLF">steps</span> just wait for children to come in and he pulled their hair so much until the kid collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="71">Then we went in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">We sit down, there must be a least 300 children approximately.</sentence><sentence id="73">Now, the teacher came in.</sentence><sentence id="74">When the teacher came in, you could drop a pin, and it was so quiet nobody made a move.</sentence><sentence id="75">The teacher walked around and they didn't like any child or whatever it is, you got a beating.</sentence><sentence id="76">So, that's the way life was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">Unfortunately I was a lefty, and I could not write with my right hand because I was a lefty.</sentence><sentence id="78">So, the teacher was watching most of the people who were lefties.</sentence><sentence id="79">She had a big stick, I would say at least one inch thick, short stick.</sentence><sentence id="80">When I had to write, I grabbed the pencil with the left hand, and I wanted to do what I have to do from the work.</sentence><sentence id="81">When the teacher noticed, she came over with that stick and it almost broke my arm.</sentence><sentence id="82">But there was no other way.</sentence><sentence id="83">I had to learn how to write with my right hand, which by the way away now, I do write with my right hand.</sentence><sentence id="84">It's the same thing with the food.</sentence><sentence id="85">If you're a lefty, of course you take the spoon and start eating with your left hand.</sentence><sentence id="86">You got a beating that time, too, because you're supposed to eat with your right hand.</sentence><sentence id="87">Everything came out with force just to do with the right hand.</sentence><sentence id="88">When I grow up a little bit bigger, I went to learn at a tin smith and he only had to shear with right hand shears.</sentence><sentence id="89">I had to learn how to cut with my right hand because there was no left hand shears.</sentence><sentence id="90">Like I was saying, life was going on with the Romanians, I was working during the day.</sentence><sentence id="91">Whenever I had time, sometimes in between sometimes I was working, helped out a little bit until 1940 when the Hungarians came in.</sentence><sentence id="92">The Romanians went out and the Hungarians came in.</sentence><sentence id="93">Once the Hungarians came in, the old timers used to tell us how good it was by the Hungarians before the World War so we should be happy that the Hungarians came in.</sentence><sentence id="94">Life would be different.</sentence><sentence id="95">What happened, there was a few soldiers, Jewish soldiers and they came over to us and they said this is not the same Hungarians that the older people know.</sentence><sentence id="96">This is a different type of Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="97">All right.</sentence><sentence id="98">In the beginning it was not too bad.</sentence><sentence id="99">A year or two or something, it was not too bad.</sentence><sentence id="100">By the way, in <span class="BUILDING">schooling</span>, in the thirties, the late thirties, there was a Romanian, there was a party, an anti-Semitic party.</sentence><sentence id="101">Koozar was the name of the minister and the Prime Minster was Googar.</sentence><sentence id="102"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koozer</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Googar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">In the late thirties they came in to make the pogroms, and we were so worried they were going to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> because we know they're coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> to make the</sentence><sentence id="105"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">pogrom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">What happened when it came to the <span class="REGION">area</span>, the Visho left, they turned right and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">They burned the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">They killed a lot of people there.</sentence><sentence id="109">They destroyed everything over there.</sentence><sentence id="110">That was in the late thirties.</sentence><sentence id="111">At that time, the anti- semitic thing was so big, all the things were so big, that I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="112">All my schooling was four years.</sentence><sentence id="113">I could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more due to the fact that I was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="114">My parents whatever they could they give us a little private lesson, whatever we could just to keep up the thing.</sentence><sentence id="115">My father was a singer on the weddings.</sentence><sentence id="116">He was also a canter, and he was one of the greatest men from the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">They used to call him all around the <span class="REGION">area</span> for states to sing and things.</sentence><sentence id="118">He used to put words together.</sentence><sentence id="119">If he would have been here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> he would be the greatest man in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as a singer.</sentence><sentence id="120">So, it was very hard to even keep up with the families so he also had a job -- like we had horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, which almost everybody had that thing.</sentence><sentence id="121">We had a little <span class="DLF">farm</span> there to try and grow some food things like that, but life was very hard, very hard life.</sentence><sentence id="122">When the Hungarians were in already for a few years, then we saw the true colors from the Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="123">First of all, they put us, we have to give a day's work, everybody has to give a free day's work.</sentence><sentence id="124">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">I give them a day's work, so the thing of it is you could have worked for somebody else too, if they pay you, you could work for somebody else too.</sentence><sentence id="126">So, I worked five days a week so we didn't feel like going to work.</sentence><sentence id="127">The people who had <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> think like this.</sentence><sentence id="128">I used to get paid and go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">What was the work?Most of the work was preparation for the war.</sentence><sentence id="130">We went out to work on the <span class="DLF">volleys</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">We dig big <span class="DLF">holes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">We put <span class="DLF">trenches</span> around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> should not come through.</sentence><sentence id="133">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> should not be able to come through the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">So, we worked day in and day out.</sentence><sentence id="135">After the Hungarians decided why should there be one day where everybody goes to work, so they put us to working more days.</sentence><sentence id="136">So, really we had the most miserable life of the Hungarians for the past few years.</sentence><sentence id="137">They took away everything whatever we had.</sentence><sentence id="138">If somebody had a cow, they took it away.</sentence><sentence id="139">If they had a horse, they took it away.</sentence><sentence id="140">They left you flat with everything.</sentence><sentence id="141">The <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was with all the people who we got along so great all those years, they looked the other way.</sentence><sentence id="142">I don't think there was one person who survived over there that somebody should hide that person.</sentence><sentence id="143">There was not such a thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: This was from what <span class="NPIP">period</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: That was the period since the Hungarians came in.</sentence><sentence id="293">I would say from 1942 to 1944, because the first, in the beginning it was not too bad with the Hungarians, like I said.</sentence><sentence id="294">They needed the wood and there was a <span class="BUILDING">wood factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">I worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where they sawed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and we cleaned off, you know around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> they had that black thing around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>, we chopped it off to clean the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> to be able to bring it down to prepare if for wood.</sentence><sentence id="296">So, it was a very hard life.</sentence><sentence id="297">We got paid very little.</sentence><sentence id="298">We got paid -- talking about child labor.</sentence><sentence id="299">You were 15, 16 and you put in eight, ten, twelve hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="300">It was the same thing with almost with everybody had to go through the same thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: I'm going to ask you now to tell me before the forming of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, tell me how much your family knew about what was going on with the war and with Jews in other parts of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="311">Did they know what was happening?</sentence><sentence id="312">Did they know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="318">A. After, I would say in "43, we already it got very, very bad in general.</sentence><sentence id="319">Very bad for everybody for every Jew.</sentence><sentence id="320">If a Hungarian soldier passed on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, the first thing he called over a Jew and he hit them.</sentence><sentence id="321">No reason.</sentence><sentence id="322">He went to the horses, they were riding horses, he would beat them up.</sentence><sentence id="323">Then later on, we heard something, that something is going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">There was something, a daughter-in-law was from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and she wrote a letter.</sentence><sentence id="325">She was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and her husband was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">They couldn't get together because the war started already.</sentence><sentence id="327">So, she wrote a letter and it was censored so bad, that he couldn't write anything what's going on there.</sentence><sentence id="328">So, I will never forget this woman was a rabbi's daughter-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="329">So, she wrote for her husband and which I said for the rabbi, she wrote in the letter we should know what's going on there.</sentence><sentence id="330">She wrote like this.</sentence><sentence id="331">There is that means money, is no more.</sentence><sentence id="332">It doesn't exit any more.</sentence><sentence id="333">So we know from that two words we started to figure out what's going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">There was no radio or any other communication.</sentence><sentence id="335">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="336">Later on, the situation got very bad.</sentence><sentence id="337">We heard, first of all before the state came, they called to the Army.</sentence><sentence id="338">They were calling all the Jewish children who were at age at that time, who were 17, 18 19 to go to the Army.</sentence><sentence id="339">In the Army they used those Jewish kids.</sentence><sentence id="340">They used them to bring ammunition to the <span class="DLF">front line</span> to do all kind of work for the Hungarian Army.</sentence><sentence id="341">The Army -- they had uniformed Army, they had yellow around the arms -- armband, yellow.</sentence><sentence id="342">This way they recognized them as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="343">There was also another group where they had white arm bands.</sentence><sentence id="344">That means they were not pure Jews.</sentence><sentence id="345">The mother was Jewish or the father was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="346">So, they had two type of things.</sentence><sentence id="347">I did not go -- I'm supposed to go to the Army at that time, my father says to me, you don't have to go, let's go together because we don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="348">He also told me something -- he told me it looks like something is going on terrible in the world.</sentence><sentence id="349">I don't think you're going to be a Hungarian soldier.</sentence><sentence id="350">I think you are going to be some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">Then, we all got together.</sentence><sentence id="352">They called us.</sentence><sentence id="353">How did they get the people together?</sentence><sentence id="354">There were drums.</sentence><sentence id="355">If you know when sometimes they have a drum and they bang on the drum and they got the people together, that was a sign that the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to get together because there is some news to tell.</sentence><sentence id="356">Then they tell us that everybody there's going to be a round up and they have to go in this and this <span class="REGION">area</span> like but us on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">There was the <span class="DLF">Jewish street</span> and they started making the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> all around.</sentence><sentence id="358">The <span class="DLF">Jewish street</span> over there and the <span class="DLF">Romanian street</span>'s name was , the number was 25.</sentence><sentence id="359">The Hungarian name was 32.</sentence><sentence id="360">So, the reason is because I tell you this is because when they got us all together they told us which <span class="DLF">street</span> to get in together.</sentence><sentence id="361">So this was the word the guy was using to get us there.</sentence><sentence id="362">And the same thing they got all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all around the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and they got all these people together and they bring them in and that's <span class="DLF">street</span> around the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">We had so many people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where to sleep or where to go or what to do anything because one was on top of the other one.</sentence><sentence id="364">The time wasn't too long in there.</sentence><sentence id="365">We was about a month in there.</sentence><sentence id="366">They were-- who was watching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was the Hungarians and the Germans, the local people was watching in there.</sentence><sentence id="367">The food was very scarce.</sentence><sentence id="368">There was no food in there.</sentence><sentence id="369">My father used to know all those big shots in there from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he used to help a lot of people out.</sentence><sentence id="370">If they were having a problem, he used to help them out.</sentence><sentence id="371">He used to go there, so he went over to one of those guards and he said, "look we are all together in one <span class="NPIP">place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="372">Those people</sentence><sentence id="374">they had <span class="DLF">farms</span> - the Jewish people and they put away their food for the winter time.</sentence><sentence id="375">They have them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="376">Let's bring it in.</sentence><sentence id="377">Let's feed them otherwise it's going to rot away anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="378">And so how some way my father convinced them and we started bringing in all the food from around.</sentence><sentence id="379">I got permission to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and I went out of course I bring back the food so there was also other people they brought in the food and it started to get a little bit better.</sentence><sentence id="380">Mostly what we brought in was potatoes, things like this because corn there was a lot of them.</sentence><sentence id="381">Then I saw a little later on I saw German soldiers began in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">They were already probably got their orders to round us out and start shipping out.</sentence><sentence id="383">They put us in the <span class="DLF">line</span>, find out how many people there are and they made four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">My father was -- when they round them up, when the German soldier passed, he give him some kind of a salute, so the guy looked at him and he asked him, he said, "Are you a military man?"</sentence><sentence id="385">He said, "Yes I am, this and this front and I am an officer."</sentence><sentence id="386">Do you have a -- well, he didn't do anything he just bypassed and to find out that information.</sentence><sentence id="387">They made like I said four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">We had two <span class="BUILDING">stations train stations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">One <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> they called it the small <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> used to stop and drop off people, and the one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was a bigger <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where the railroad came in.</sentence><sentence id="390">I also want to say that before all those things, I worked for the Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="391">We took apart the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>, the <span class="DLF">Romanian tracks</span>, you know from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and we send them into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="392">So, I was loading and unloading the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">There was two Hungarian officers and they are not supposed to hire Jewish children for the job.</sentence><sentence id="394">When I went in there and applied for the job, he asked me the name, he asked me what your name, I said Bernard Pasternak.</sentence><sentence id="395">He said that sounds too Jewish, so he changed my name for Pasteronish.</sentence><sentence id="396">That's a real Hungarian name, and I got the job.</sentence><sentence id="397">They paid very good.</sentence><sentence id="398">We had it very good for a few months.</sentence><sentence id="399">The job only lasted for a few months because there wasn't so many <span class="DLF">tracks</span> to pick apart and we loaded them.</sentence><sentence id="400">We did not load them in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Visho</span> from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, we had to go about 50 miles away where they loaded those <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">So we went with the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we unloaded.</sentence><sentence id="402">That was before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and all those things happened.</sentence><sentence id="403">We -- due to the fact they were short on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, so they made four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and we were going on the fourth <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">When they got together everybody, they told them don't take anything, just take what you could take with you because you have on other things over there and you wouldn't need them.</sentence><sentence id="405">To that point, we didn't know what was going on -- absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="406">As a matter of fact, they told us we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> until the war is over for security reasons or whatever they want.</sentence><sentence id="407">We arrived with the fourth <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">With the other three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, I mean it was about two days apart, so the other three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> left.</sentence><sentence id="409">When we got to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, I saw the box <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we saw all those things what happened.</sentence><sentence id="410">People on there with small children crying throwing packets down on the Hungarian soldiers and the collaborators pulling the bags out of the family they are taking away everything.</sentence><sentence id="411">They didn't need it anyhow, but we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="412">So finally, we went in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">I don't know, probably must have been 20 or 30 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> in there.</sentence><sentence id="414">We went in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="415">He push you in, maybe seventy, eighty people.</sentence><sentence id="416">You can't tell how many you have with children, older ladies and things like this, and then they close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they locked it with a lock on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">The only air you had in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> was if you see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span>, the ones you see in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> was</sentence><sentence id="419">the same one they were taking away.</sentence><sentence id="420">All you could see is the same thing you see there.</sentence><sentence id="421">First we were going for about a day or so and then they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> for everybody and says there is water in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> here because those days all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going with water, so they had to pump in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="422">So, they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they were watching us like the biggest criminals with guns and says only one to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and go fill up with water for the rest of the people.</sentence><sentence id="423">It happened I was the one and my father was the one.</sentence><sentence id="424">We tried to supply water, whatever we could to the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, and then my father saw a <span class="DLF">hatch</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span>, because every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> had a <span class="DLF">hatch</span> probably for the .</sentence><sentence id="425">He took that so nobody should see it.</sentence><sentence id="426">We finish with the water, then close the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and we started going.</sentence><sentence id="427">Then my father called my over and said, "Let's dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in there.</sentence><sentence id="428">Let's break the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> there to make a <span class="BUILDING">facility</span>."</sentence><sentence id="429">We worked quite a while.</sentence><sentence id="430">It was very dark and we carted through and we made a <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> there to go out like a thing.</sentence><sentence id="431">Everybody was using this.</sentence><sentence id="432">We were putting something around there so people would have a little privacy.</sentence><sentence id="433">It took quite a few days before we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but the middle of the way there was a few guys in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> they told me, if you could pay attention, are we turning left or right and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">I says to the guy, no we are turning left, he says that's bad news because right is to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, left is to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">It's the one other <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">I don't remember if it took five days or six days.</sentence><sentence id="437">When we got off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, first of all in that time when I was taking the water there was a couple of dead children already, which I took them out and there was somebody going through with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and I put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> because there was a lot of sick children already and they caught already.</sentence><sentence id="438">Nothing in there was no food, no nothing, very little things whatever we had.</sentence><sentence id="439">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, like my mother will know something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="568">Q: I want to ask you some questions about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="570">A: All right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Who gave you permission to leave, or did you sneak out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="574">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="575">You couldn't sneak out because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was surrounded by corroborators to make sure nobody was out.</sentence><sentence id="576">And besides that, which I did not mention, you already had the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="577">You had the yellow star, and if they caught you without wearing the yellow star you were finished.</sentence><sentence id="578">So, right away they know you.</sentence><sentence id="579">And I think all the things that my father knew so many of those guys and they hand picked a few of the people to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> to bring in the stuff.</sentence><sentence id="580">It wasn't -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was quite a ride, maybe thirty, forty miles in some <span class="REGION">area</span> until we got all the food together and brought it in in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="581">Like I was saying, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, my mother put her hands around and squeezed me.</sentence><sentence id="582">She said, "I hope you remember me."</sentence><sentence id="583">I did not know what she meant because we were so naive we didn't know what's going on until the last minute.</sentence><sentence id="584">When we got off of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, first what I saw it was sickening just to see.</sentence><sentence id="585">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> had the only one facility from all the 40 or 50 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="586">They opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, all the dirt came out when they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="587">People were half to the waist with that dirt around from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there was no other way.</sentence><sentence id="588">You had to go from so many days.</sentence><sentence id="589">Only one time I</sentence><sentence id="591">remember they opened for water and after that they did not open for water.</sentence><sentence id="592">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going so fast.</sentence><sentence id="593">Usually in those days a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> those days was going about 30 miles an hour.</sentence><sentence id="594">You couldn't go any more because you had to put the water in, the coal, all those things.</sentence><sentence id="595">It took a very long time for those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> until they reached the <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="596">But when we went in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going so fast, my God, it must have been 60 or 70 miles an hours.</sentence><sentence id="597">We thought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going to flap over, things like this, because he was carrying animals in there.</sentence><sentence id="598">What difference does it make what happened to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="599">Now, when we arrived already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, there was a lot of people over there came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="600">People were already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="601">They came over and they say, if you have small child, give it to an older lady.</sentence><sentence id="602">So, my sister said to the guy, I have a small child and my mother.</sentence><sentence id="603">He said, "Give it to your mother."</sentence><sentence id="604">So, I had a little sister and my mother and of course my nephew, they went with my mother on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="605">They looked, I saw a guy over there was looking and he put his hand out and he make like this.</sentence><sentence id="606">After I find out there was .</sentence><sentence id="607">I didn't even know who that is.</sentence><sentence id="608">After I find out that that was the guy who did all those things.</sentence><sentence id="609">He selected them.</sentence><sentence id="610">I was very worried because the younger one they put them all with the older people so I was pretty worried because I see what they're doing.</sentence><sentence id="611">I said something is going on because they are selecting the older people and the younger ones and the other ones they left go to work.</sentence><sentence id="612">They put them in another <span class="NPIP">area</span> for work.</sentence><sentence id="613">So, finally I was dressed, you know, at that time we had clothes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, people had so much clothes, so I had some kind of a coat at that time and I put a coat on and I looked a little older and I was sent on the side where they send the people to work.</sentence><sentence id="614">That's what happened after.</sentence><sentence id="615">And that time there is other guys they came over and they says to us, "Do you see over there, the smoke over there?"</sentence><sentence id="616">And I said yes, what's going on over there?</sentence><sentence id="617">What are they doing there?</sentence><sentence id="618">He says, "They're burning people there."</sentence><sentence id="619">I said, burning people?</sentence><sentence id="620">He said yes, they call it a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and they're burning people over there.</sentence><sentence id="621">Then he said to me do you see all those people they are going over there.</sentence><sentence id="622">This is the people who were there already.</sentence><sentence id="623">We went from there, we went in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from there.</sentence><sentence id="624">First, we had to take the clothes off and throw it in the corner there.</sentence><sentence id="625">I took my coat and I throw it in the corner there.</sentence><sentence id="626">I figure it's going to be over soon and I'll take my coat back.</sentence><sentence id="627">It never happened.</sentence><sentence id="628">So, then we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="629">We went in the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> where they told the people what to do, where to go.</sentence><sentence id="630">We were lined up over there, and they first of all the guy who commanded the whole thing came out.</sentence><sentence id="631">He made an appeal, an appeal they call it, to see how many people he has in his <span class="REGION">jurisdiction</span>.</sentence><sentence id="632">Then another guy came over and he says, I was with my father, near my father at that time, he came over and he said is there here any mechanics, any electricians.</sentence><sentence id="633">I was a tin smith and mechanic right away I want to be.</sentence><sentence id="634">The other people said good for you you're going to be a mechanic and you're going to do better than we were doing.</sentence><sentence id="635">My father says to me why go over.</sentence><sentence id="636">Let's be all together.</sentence><sentence id="637">Let's go together.</sentence><sentence id="638">The people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> they were saying, why don't you let him go as a mechanic.</sentence><sentence id="639">Why -- suppose we go in another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="640">We could see already what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="641">Let him go over there.</sentence><sentence id="642">So finally my father says okay, go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="643">We went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the camp there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="644">The whole thing was only a few days.</sentence><sentence id="645">We went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and then all those mechanics they had we got round up and we were taking by big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to .</sentence><sentence id="646">We did not know at that time they took us to .</sentence><sentence id="647">We</sentence><sentence id="649">figured there is the mechanics thing and there we were going to work.</sentence><sentence id="650">We arrived in .</sentence><sentence id="651">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over there already prepared.</sentence><sentence id="652">You got your <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there and everything and then we find out we're going to work in a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="653">That's what they did with all of the mechanics.</sentence><sentence id="654">They put us in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="655">The next day we went already to work which they were putting it --- there was three shifts.</sentence><sentence id="656">There was a morning shift, a noon shift and a night shift.</sentence><sentence id="657">We went to the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> there and there was two types of <span class="DLF">mines</span> in there.</sentence><sentence id="658">First one was about 1,000 feet and one was about 1500 or 1600 feet.</sentence><sentence id="659">I was working in the lower one, about 1500 feet.</sentence><sentence id="660">We came down there.</sentence><sentence id="661">They give you a light.</sentence><sentence id="662">They give you a light to go to be able to see because it's so dark.</sentence><sentence id="663">They gave me a lantern.</sentence><sentence id="664">The number was 4400.</sentence><sentence id="665">Also, when I go back, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> the time before I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they give me they tattoo it, I got a tattoo in my arm because most of the people they sent to work they put a tattoo in my arm.</sentence><sentence id="666">I got the tattoo and I was so naive at that time.</sentence><sentence id="667">I was there with my cousin and we still didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="668">I saw they give numbers and I saw some people get smaller number and bigger number and I went to where they give a bigger number.</sentence><sentence id="669">Because we were naive we said let's have a bigger number.</sentence><sentence id="670">What they did to my cousin, I got 84 whatever I got number and he got a number after mine and something went wrong there and they put his head in a drum of water and they drowned him and he died on the spot over there.</sentence><sentence id="671">You never lasted more than a day over there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="672">Then when we were going back, we went down to the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="776">Q: Wait, let's go back once more.</sentence><sentence id="777">When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and you were going through registration, you were still with your father in registration, and did you know what had happened to your mother then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: No, we did not know what happened to my mother until after I find out a few days later.</sentence><sentence id="781">Even they pointed out to us, we could not believe it.</sentence><sentence id="782">Then some people were talking about the people and who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>, they call it the .</sentence><sentence id="783">They were saying to me, that's the living in that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> over there, they have everything over there because they are doing such a special job.</sentence><sentence id="784">Well, we did not know after a while they got rid of the and took new people.</sentence><sentence id="785">We didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="786">Then we find out after what happened and who the was and what they did after a while.</sentence><sentence id="787">With my father, I was there after the first <span class="DLF">line</span> up, the first appeal after that.</sentence><sentence id="788">Then, I went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> was and my father wasn't at that <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I never heard from him after.</sentence><sentence id="789">I never heard what happened.</sentence><sentence id="790">We went down in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>, like I said, my lantern was 4400 and we were working with civilian Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="791">The light --my light had a red stripe around and the civilian had white.</sentence><sentence id="792">We also to recognize us, in the center of the hat there was a cut in straight, this way they recognize you right away in case you run away someplace.</sentence><sentence id="793">They put me to work in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>, which I never heard of a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">I never saw a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="795">A <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> is this way.</sentence><sentence id="796">The one I was it was approximately four or five feet high.</sentence><sentence id="797">That doesn't mean there's coal in the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="798">The coal is only about two feet in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="799">In order to get the coal out, you have to have some kind of supporters to hold up, to be able to take the coal out.</sentence><sentence id="800">They dynamite the coal and if you wouldn't have had</sentence><sentence id="802">supporters, the whole thing would fall down.</sentence><sentence id="803">So, you had to have special supporters to hold up and then to dig the coal out to get the coal out.</sentence><sentence id="804">Once we got the coal out from there, you took it out with a shovel and there was something not far from where you throw the shovel there, it was something, it was going up and down, five inches up, five inches down, you know it was shaking until the coal went down, because it was a little down hill over there.</sentence><sentence id="805">There was one day when they come to inspect it looks like the Germans didn't get enough coal and they came to inspect the <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">What happened how come there is no more coming out.</sentence><sentence id="807">I saw some people from far away, but I didn't pay much attention who they are, but they did look to me like they're civilians, Polish civilians, work in the <span class="DLF">mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="808">They come around and they stop everybody over there who were working there.</sentence><sentence id="809">Some of them they said report to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, which I never saw those people again anymore.</sentence><sentence id="810">So they took them off the <span class="DLF">line</span> and they got new people.</sentence><sentence id="811">Then I was told they eliminated them because they didn't do the job.</sentence><sentence id="812">Somehow, for some reason I don't know I always worked very hard all my life and I saw there is no way out.</sentence><sentence id="813">You really have to work if you want to survive.</sentence><sentence id="814">So, I picked up work, kept on working the right way and they come around, the inspectors, the Nazi inspector, they came around and they checked me out, how I worked.</sentence><sentence id="815">Then the guy asked me, what is your number.</sentence><sentence id="816">I showed him my tattoo and so the other guy says to me, you know you're going to have a lot of problems because they took your number down like the other guy.</sentence><sentence id="817">No, it was the other way around, believe it or not.</sentence><sentence id="818">They gave me a premium of a bottle of wine because I was a good worker.</sentence><sentence id="819">I took the bottle of wine and turned it in for a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="820">I gave it to one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">They gave me a piece of bread for it, which I wouldn't drink it anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="822">Also, for the good workers, they also give two cigarettes a day.</sentence><sentence id="823">I also turned in my cigarettes for a little soup or whatever they could.</sentence><sentence id="824">There were some people who were chain smokers, they give away their food for the cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="825">There was quite a few prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war, and most of them they give away the cigarettes for the thing.</sentence><sentence id="826">What did we eat when going into the <span class="DLF">mine</span>?</sentence><sentence id="827">In the morning, we had black coffee with a little piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="828">Of course there was no lunch.</sentence><sentence id="829">Lunch you were at the mercy of the civilians.</sentence><sentence id="830">If you find a good civilian there, he'd throw you a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="831">If you find a civilian who didn't have or he didn't care, you were there with bread, without a little piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="832">Somehow, someway I managed to recognize the guys a little bit, I always had a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="833">We were working until 6:00 at night.</sentence><sentence id="834">From 8:00 in the morning until about 6:00 at night.</sentence><sentence id="835">Something like that.</sentence><sentence id="836">Like I was saying, there was a morning and a noon shift and a night shift.</sentence><sentence id="837">The night shift, the people who brought the SS who escorted the morning shift had to take back the noon shift from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">They always took back a shift because we didn't walk back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> without a Nazi guard, which I would say it was a 15, 20 minute to half hour walk.</sentence><sentence id="839">At night they had to take us back, they brought another shift and they had to take us back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="840">What happened?</sentence><sentence id="841">We had something to finish and those Germans did not wait for us.</sentence><sentence id="842">We were sitting in that <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> until the next evening.</sentence><sentence id="843">No food, absolutely no food, no nothing, only the mercy, whatever the civilian throw you a piece of bread of things like this.</sentence><sentence id="844">I also, on Sunday we did not work.</sentence><sentence id="845">We worked six days a week.</sentence><sentence id="846">On Sunday I also volunteer to clean the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a little bit for that I got another little soup.</sentence><sentence id="847">I always tried to manage somehow to get a little more.</sentence><sentence id="848">When we went in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">kapos</span></sentence><sentence id="850">0 they were carrying the lights to see where to go.</sentence><sentence id="851">I used to carry it for them or for that when I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they

weaker.</sentence><sentence id="1393">The order looks like it was from the commanding officer there.</sentence><sentence id="1394">Anybody who could not walk, you had to eliminate them.</sentence><sentence id="1395">And those collaborators with the Germans they did a good job.</sentence><sentence id="1396">Anybody who could follow, they shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="1397">They kill them on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="1398">At the time when we</sentence><sentence id="1400">6 walked, we saw so many dead bodies on both sides, females, male, when we saw those things we tried to pull off a pair of shoes, things like this and that's the way I got my shoes in there.</sentence><sentence id="1401">I took it off of a dead body.</sentence><sentence id="1402">I took a coat off, some kind of a blanket, so, we kept on walking.</sentence><sentence id="1403">We walked for another few days.</sentence><sentence id="1404">We --when I say walk, we did not walk.</sentence><sentence id="1405">We dragged the legs because you could not raise your leg more than an half an inch.</sentence><sentence id="1406">There was no strength to raise your feet a little bit, so you were dragging him until you came in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and they were looking for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1407">It was January at that time already and Europe is very cold this time of the year.</sentence><sentence id="1408">So, they were looking for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and they came around the Germans they say the language I had no problem because I spoke the language.</sentence><sentence id="1409">So they said there is no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> we had to go in open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1410">So there was some open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> over there and there was some snow then maybe two feet of snow was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1411">It looks like they didn't use them for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1412">The first thing we did was a few guys over there with the little strength we had we pushed the snow to the center a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1413">We went in maybe eighty ninety people in that open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1414">Some of the people you know we were all around, sitting all around that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> but some of the people had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to get in there so they were staying in the center of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1415">We were leaning one to the other <span class="NPIP">one</span> just to try to get a little warm in there.</sentence><sentence id="1416">We were going maybe another day or so then we stopped in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then one guy was hollering from down there he asked is there anybody that could hear us or see us, so with a little strength I had I went up and looked down.</sentence><sentence id="1417">So, he was saying in German how many people are in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">I counted and there was I think 82 or 84, but I remember counting.</sentence><sentence id="1419">I told him how many people.</sentence><sentence id="1420">They told them I would say approximately about a pound of bread, a little loaf of bread, the same thing about a pound of margarine.</sentence><sentence id="1421">When I give it out to everybody, there was nothing left.</sentence><sentence id="1422">It was exactly what I said.</sentence><sentence id="1423">So, we were going for another few days, we were driving in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> for another few days and the only food we had was like a piece a bread and the margarine.</sentence><sentence id="1424">The margarine was so hard that I was nibbling in the margarine.</sentence><sentence id="1425">It was hard.</sentence><sentence id="1426">We didn't know where we were going, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1427">Finally the destination was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1428">We arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1429">Came to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and there is everybody out from the 80 people I think 20 went out.</sentence><sentence id="1430">The rest of them froze to death on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1431">We went out from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where we could.</sentence><sentence id="1432">We went in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1433">They had some soup for us, arrived in there, which I remember we had some soup.</sentence><sentence id="1434">We went in there, we got a little soup.</sentence><sentence id="1435">They give us <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1436">Of course, they cut our hair.</sentence><sentence id="1437">Cut everything, you know, undress completely, cut everything.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Went under the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and then they give us a new number because the Auschwitz number, the tattoo number was no good for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1439">So, they give us a new number, and we have to go by the number now because nobody had a name.</sentence><sentence id="1440">My new number 117,682 so wherever you went you had to know the number because that was your life.</sentence><sentence id="1441">There was a few days we were over there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, so we rested a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1442">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> wasn't too bad.</sentence><sentence id="1443">In there, it was a little warm in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> at that time, and we had a little soup, things like this.</sentence><sentence id="1444">We were able to stand on our legs.</sentence><sentence id="1445">There came big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took us to to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</sentence><sentence id="1446">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wasn't the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were in the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> thing.</sentence><sentence id="1447">That was one of the filthiest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in there.</sentence><sentence id="1448">It was so bad in there there was no where to lay down in there.</sentence><sentence id="1449">You had to sleep and go lay down wherever you could in there.</sentence><sentence id="1450">The</sentence><sentence id="1452">7 lice were eating you up.</sentence><sentence id="1453">You could take them away with your hand.</sentence><sentence id="1454">You could take a whole bunch with one hand and push them away.</sentence><sentence id="1455">Wherever you turn around, it's like mosquitos, where you go in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with mosquitos around.</sentence><sentence id="1456">That's the way the lice were around you.</sentence><sentence id="1457">So, they got us together again and they put us to work in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1458">The next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>'s name was .</sentence><sentence id="1459">We went to work there in a <span class="DLF">mine</span>, a <span class="DLF">stone mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1460">We were digging stones, we were digging dirt out.</sentence><sentence id="1461">That's the job they gave us.</sentence><sentence id="1462">I don't know really what they were doing over there, but we were working in the <span class="DLF">mine</span> in there, taking stones out.</sentence><sentence id="1463">Then I saw there were little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> in there and there was a lot of and I said to myself you know, maybe I could find out if they had any mechanic work over here and I shouldn't have to dig and shovel rocks out of there.</sentence><sentence id="1464">I went down there.</sentence><sentence id="1465">You couldn't run away because you had Nazis all around watching you.</sentence><sentence id="1466">You couldn't go far.</sentence><sentence id="1467">You could only go where you were working.</sentence><sentence id="1468">I went over there and there was two guys, one German, heavyset guy.</sentence><sentence id="1469">He was as bad as <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1470">But there was another guy, a shorter fellow, his name was Max.</sentence><sentence id="1471">I said to him in German, I said, I am a mechanic and you have so many of those guns, the drill guns, maybe you want me to help you out with this.</sentence><sentence id="1472">So, there was a Russian guy also, a prisoner of war, and that guy, he understood that kind of work.</sentence><sentence id="1473">He got the job.</sentence><sentence id="1474">So, this guy says to me, this guy Max, he says, you know what, he says he's better in this, I have another job for you.</sentence><sentence id="1475">Go back up to the <span class="DLF">mines</span> and whatever you see needs a little oil, a little fixing, so be the mechanic there and make sure everything runs smooth.</sentence><sentence id="1476">I was very happy he gave me some tools.</sentence><sentence id="1477">I don't think the tools weighed two pounds.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I couldn't even carry the tools.</sentence><sentence id="1479">I was so weak I couldn't even carry those tools, but some how, some way I carried the tools up there, and I was trying to fix whatever I can until the day passed, and then we walked back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> whatever, the way we could walk back.</sentence><sentence id="1480">We went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which it was because we were working in .</sentence><sentence id="1481">We passed a lot of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1482">We walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which it was written in some <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> is only for people who want to gain a little weight.</sentence><sentence id="1483">In German it was written.</sentence><sentence id="1484">That <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> is known for .</sentence><sentence id="1485">It was written over there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1486">When we went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the Germans, they came out and they brought some food for the SS.They feed them food.</sentence><sentence id="1487">God forbid if one was trying to grab the food.</sentence><sentence id="1488">He didn't make it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1489">We went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1490">It went on for a little while going back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="1491">Then we saw a lot of bombs, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> with a lot of things flying around.</sentence><sentence id="1492">Then we say, something is going on and something will happen.</sentence><sentence id="1493">From there, it wasn't a long time - - it was only a few months in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1494">Then we started walking back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1495">That was the second death march.</sentence><sentence id="1496">That was the most miserable death march anyone could witness.</sentence><sentence id="1497">We left a few thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="1498">The way we left and the way we were going.</sentence><sentence id="1499">I don't think we arrived a few hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="1500">I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1501">On the way we were going, the bombs were so great and the artillery fired was so severe, things like this, the Germans were so afraid that they are going to kill them.</sentence><sentence id="1502">At that time, we had the striped clothes and of course we had some coats, too, striped coats.</sentence><sentence id="1503">While you were walking, the way you were walking and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> they come so low, they could have picked you off with a machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="1504">The Germans I had two Germans under my coat.</sentence><sentence id="1505">They were hiding under really my coat they shouldn't be able to be picked up.</sentence><sentence id="1506">They survived that way, too.</sentence><sentence id="1507">I wasn't the only one.</sentence><sentence id="1508">Only the other people were the same way,</sentence><sentence id="1510">8 they did to the other people the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1511">We were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1512">I saw on the way the <span class="DLF">supply landing strip</span>, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, with food burning.</sentence><sentence id="1513">We were running to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to see if maybe there was some kind of a food leftover, which did not burn.</sentence><sentence id="1514">When you run to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, the Germans killed you.</sentence><sentence id="1515">You couldn't even go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1516">There was also a lot of <span class="DLF">farm</span> there was a lot of food from the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1517">There was apples things like this on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1518">If you run down to grab an apple the Germans killed you.</sentence><sentence id="1519">You didn't have to wait for the Nazis to kill you, they killed you once you stepped out of <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">It came to a point, I was so weak, I really could not go any more.</sentence><sentence id="1521">I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> over there where they picked up, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they picked up all the people who could not walk anymore, really could not walk, they tell them to go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they carry them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they put them flat in a German flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence

German .</sentence><sentence id="1524">I still could walk.</sentence><sentence id="1525">We walked for another few hours.</sentence><sentence id="1526">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, which I'm supposed to be on they blew it up with grenades out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1527">They blew the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> up

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1703">A The Germans, the Germans blew it up.</sentence><sentence id="1704">When I saw, before we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, I never saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> how it looks until it came so long, which actually, they waved at us the people over there.</sentence><sentence id="1705">That low they came down.</sentence><sentence id="1706">I really couldn't make out what kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> they were, whether they were British or which Allies they were, but I did find out.</sentence><sentence id="1707">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1708">I did find out that after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1709">Then finally we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1710">In <span

arrived in there.</sentence><sentence id="1712">You were laying flat.</sentence><sentence id="1713">You go in there and first of all you couldn't do nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1714">You were laying in there.</sentence><sentence id="1715">You were sick.</sentence><sentence id="1716">All kind of sickness you had in there.</sentence><sentence id="1717">Then a day later they were giving you some soup.</sentence><sentence id="1718">Now, you had to stay in the <span class="DLF">line</span> to get some food.</sentence><sentence id="1719">There was no such thing anymore about names and numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1720">You went over to get the soup.</sentence><sentence id="1721">You were lined up a few thousand people because there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from before.</sentence><sentence id="1722">They brought in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">center camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1723">You lined up by the time you took the food -- when they give you the food, by the time a few feet away, they grabbed it from you already.</sentence><sentence id="1724">The people themselves, the hungry people, they grabbed you.</sentence><sentence id="1725">You had to be very lucky to eat the food they give it to you over there because somebody would grab it.</sentence><sentence id="1726">When I saw what happened when it came to my turn, as soon as they put it in, I swallowed it on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="1727">I didn't even carry it further down.</sentence><sentence id="1728">Sometimes I was lucky and I went twice in the <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1729">Sometimes I could go twice.</sentence><sentence id="1730">A few days later we heard again shouting and we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying on top of us.</sentence><sentence id="1731">We heard a lot of shouting going on and that's the time the Germans already came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1732">They already came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they started grabbing everybody because there was one <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was still in German hands.</sentence><sentence id="1733">They wanted to get the people there.</sentence><sentence id="1734">They were still grabbing people and whoever they could, they came in with a gun, and whoever couldn't make it, they shot him on the spot, which before, like I said, a German never came into the <span

id="1738">It came to my mind very fast.</sentence><sentence id="1739">I had a in my nose, which it was bleeding all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1740">I had to touch my nose it was bleeding.</sentence><sentence id="1741">So, I was laying down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and I touch my nose and whatever blood I had I had in my mouth, put it in my mouth and lay down flat on my back with the eyes turned over.</sentence><sentence id="1742">I was so skinny.</sentence><sentence id="1743">I don't know how many pounds I have, maybe 50, 60, 40.</sentence><sentence id="1744">I don't know how many pounds I had.</sentence><sentence id="1745">I was laying and then I saw the dead bodies how they look, so I was imitating the dead bodies over there.</sentence><sentence id="1746">When the Germans came, two, three, four.</sentence><sentence id="1747">They all come around, and they first they shot all around whoever made a little move.</sentence><sentence id="1748">When they came around and the guy was loading the guns he says here's another one.</sentence><sentence id="1749">The other said, don't waste your bullets he's .</sentence><sentence id="1750">He shouldn't shoot anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1751">I was laying there, maybe an hour, an hour and a half.</sentence><sentence id="1752">I didn't even want to open my eyes to see who was around.</sentence><sentence id="1753">Then a guy walks around and says whoever can get up get because the Germans are gone, the Americans are here, at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1754">Now we tried to get up whatever we could.</sentence><sentence id="1755">I saw American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1756">Several of them were speaking Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="1757">They came around and they talk in Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="1758">That was one of the greatest things.</sentence><sentence id="1759">American soldier to come over to me and say in Yiddish, is there more Jews around?</sentence><sentence id="1760">I said they're all Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1761">Most of them are all Jews around.</sentence><sentence id="1762">They were trying to do whatever they can.</sentence><sentence id="1763">They did not touch us because we were all sick.</sentence><sentence id="1764">Not to get any disease from that <span class="NPIP">thing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1765">I see more soldiers and more soldiers coming around and checking out what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="1766">Later on, a while later I find out that guy who was watching and looking there it was General Patton's third army.</sentence><sentence id="1767">Those people liberated us.</sentence><sentence id="1768">It took a little while until everybody come to himself.</sentence><sentence id="1769">It was one of the biggest mistake that our own people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> did.</sentence><sentence id="1770">They went and emptied out all the food that the Germans had accumulated.</sentence><sentence id="1771">They brought it in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1772">Nobody told us be careful, your stomach has shrunk.</sentence><sentence id="1773">We started eating whatever we could.</sentence><sentence id="1774">I got a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in a box of dog dishes and I kept on eating dog dishes until I got typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1775">I got so sick they took me in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">camp hospital</span>, which it was a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi hospital</span> and guess who was the doctor?</sentence><sentence id="1776">The Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1777">The German Nazis who wanted to destroy me, they are the ones that treated me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp because</span> they were prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1778">It took quite a while until I came to myself but I could tell you one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1779">I had a headache for five years.</sentence><sentence id="1780">I couldn't get rid of the headache day and night from that typhus.</sentence><sentence id="1781">What happened to the other people?</sentence><sentence id="1782">Most of them died from overeating after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1783">They were eating -- there were so many things to eat it was a very few people who understand.</sentence><sentence id="1784">Then the German doctor told me in German, don't eat so much because your stomach is not strong enough.</sentence><sentence id="1785">We felt a little better.</sentence><sentence id="1786">We went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilmar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1787">That's a <span

thousands.</sentence><sentence id="1790">And they all were trying to help us, to give us something.</sentence><sentence id="1791">One guy was giving candy, another guy a box of chocolate.</sentence><sentence id="1792">What they did over there was trying to help us out to stay on our legs.</sentence><sentence id="1793">That wasn't so good either.</sentence><sentence id="1794">You wouldn't get it, we would get sick with so much food.</sentence><sentence id="1795">I got a hold of a box of chewing gum.</sentence><sentence id="1796">I took the box of chewing gum and I take one and oh, that tastes good.</sentence><sentence id="1797">I take another one, that tastes good.</sentence><sentence id="1798">Then I took four or five at the time and oh, that tastes good.</sentence><sentence id="1799">I swallowed it.</sentence><sentence id="1800">I must have swallowed a few hundred chewing gums.</sentence><sentence id="1801">Then I had the stomach cramps.</sentence><sentence id="1802">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they had to pump my stomach because it was full of chewing gums.</sentence><sentence id="1803">Then the American comes</sentence><sentence id="1805">0 over, a Jewish soldier comes over and he says to me in Yiddish, , you chew that thing, you don't eat it.</sentence><sentence id="1806">I said how do you chew it.</sentence><sentence id="1807">So he showed me how you chew it.</sentence><sentence id="1808">When I went out again in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, I saw so many people chewing that we recognize right away our people because they were chewing so funny.</sentence><sentence id="1809">We know right away from looking around everybody wanted to be an American to chew the gum at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1810">So we were over there I'd say about a month or two months.</sentence><sentence id="1811">Then they had lists over there of where your family and friends from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1812">You could go in there and take a look and if you recognize anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1813">I saw my three
