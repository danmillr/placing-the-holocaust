about there, and they took the last penny we had.</sentence><sentence id="386">They took the last hope which you just sold for a piece of bread or a potato.</sentence><sentence id="387">There was we sold anything for, but anyway...we stayed at this <span class="DLF">farm</span> with our two hundred grams of this flour and nothing else...nothing, nothing else, and occasionally we got these two
