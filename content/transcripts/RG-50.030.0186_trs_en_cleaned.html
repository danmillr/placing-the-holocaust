<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Liane Reif-Lehrer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Iwas born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zweitebitziek</span>, on November 14th, 1934.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Uh, tell me about your parents.</sentence><sentence id="12">Uh, what did your father do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Uh, my father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">And then uh went on, after he finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, to study dentistry; and then opened a dental practice uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">Uh, my mother was also born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>; and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, I think, probably for some frivolous reason--like a vacation, or to buy clothes or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="18">And somehow met my father.</sentence><sentence id="19">Uh, and they were married; and uh my mother stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">And uh they uh...I guess things were a little bit rough at first, getting my father's practice off the ground.</sentence><sentence id="21">And I think during those early years my mother helped out-- answering the phone and...and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="22">But then after that, she really did not work as long as we were still in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="23">And my father had a rather thriving practice, uh which was inside our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">There were two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that ...and they had the <span class="DLF">wall</span> broken down</sentence><sentence id="26">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 2 between them.</sentence><sentence id="27">So that basically we had this... I guess there were fourteen <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> on one <span class="NPIP">level</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">At one end was my father's practice, and the other end were our <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">Uh, so I guess it...it was fairly thriving.</sentence><sentence id="30">And I think there was a fair amount of uh...oh, social activity--in the sense of going to the opera, and uh... I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="31">Maybe some <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">And uh I think once a week they went to some relatives" and played cards.</sentence><sentence id="33">And uh, you know, probably the usual kind of thing that any middle-class family in that era would have been doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Uh, what about your...your very uh early years?</sentence><sentence id="56">Uh, you were born in "34.</sentence><sentence id="57">What do you remember of your very early childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Well, my memories are very spotty.</sentence><sentence id="62">Uh, but uh...1 remember ...1 remember my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, and I remember my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember parts of the layout of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> quite well.</sentence><sentence id="63">Not all of it.</sentence><sentence id="64">I mean, I don't think I could draw you a map.</sentence><sentence id="65">But I uh...I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, for example; and I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">Uh, I think I liked messing around in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> a lot.</sentence><sentence id="67">And I liked... We had a cook, and she let me uh play around in there and do things; although I seem to remember my mother didn't like me to do that.</sentence><sentence id="68">Uh ,the cook used to let me stand up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and help dry the dishes; and I...I think my mother was not too thrilled about that.</sentence><sentence id="69">Uh, one of the fun things that I remember is inter-act...We...there were other uh... I hate to use this word, but "servants," in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">I mean, people who cleaned and uh scrubbed laundry and did all those things; and I think they were sort of fun for me.</sentence><sentence id="71">And I remember a fair number of...of things.</sentence><sentence id="72">Like when they uh ...they</sentence><sentence id="74">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 3 used to roll up the carpets and the runners and take them up to--I don't know, the <span class="DLF">roof</span> maybe--to beat them with those old-fashioned paddles.</sentence><sentence id="75">And when they rolled up...Especially there were long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">So we had these long runners, and they would let me stand or sit on one <span class="NPIP">end</span>; and as they rolled it up and kept pulling it, I got a ride.</sentence><sentence id="77">Uh, and then when they folded the laundry, I remember getting a ride; you know, getting swung in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">Uh, and I remember getting rides on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">You know, I'd put my feet on the two parts of the broom and they would sweep along.</sentence><sentence id="80">Uh, so I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="81">I...1 remember ...uh I remember one of my governesses; uh, and I think she slept in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, actually.</sentence><sentence id="82">I think in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there was my uh sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and...and maybe... I only remember that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, although as I look back on it by the age four it's hard to believe that I still slept in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">But who knows?</sentence><sentence id="84">And then right in...in uh <span class="DLF">line</span> with that, there was this other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> where I think the governess slept.</sentence><sentence id="85">Uh, and I remember quite well the layout of my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and where there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span>, and I think there was a furry animal, and...and where the <span class="DLF">window</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="86">Uh, I'm not sure I remember terribly much else about those early uh years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: What about people?</sentence><sentence id="118">What about your parents?</sentence><sentence id="119">What do you remember about them?</sentence><sentence id="120">What do you remember about...?</sentence><sentence id="121">I believe you had a brother.</sentence><sentence id="122">Tell me about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Uh, I don't...I don't really think I remember very much from the Vienna era about people.</sentence><sentence id="130">Uh, actually it's very bothersome that I uh...I think I remembered my father when I was younger.</sentence><sentence id="131">But then, at some stage when I was probably ten or eleven, uh and of course we</sentence><sentence id="133">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 4 were already in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> long since by that time.</sentence><sentence id="134">But my mother always had a large picture of my father on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, uh her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night table</span>; and I remember a day when I looked at that picture and suddenly realized that the actual memory of my father that I remembered having then had been replaced by the memory of this photograph.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="144">Let's get a sense of...of... You described a child having a good time in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">Uh, as the Hitler years progressed and we move toward the years uh of uh...to the Anschluss, uh can you tell me what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Uh, the only thing that I can tell you about from my first-hand recollection is about Kristallnacht, because I remember that with incredible clarity.</sentence><sentence id="150">Uh, my mother was holding me in her arms, and my brother was holding onto her skirt.</sentence><sentence id="151">Uh, and there was this knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">And uh I re...1 mean, I remember that it was a very tense time and it was in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="153">And uh my mother went to... We had one of these <span class="DLF">peepholes</span> that has like a metal cover, you know, that you push aside; and my mother pushed it aside, and somebody whammed the back of a revolver and broke the glass.</sentence><sentence id="154">And then the superintendent called out, "Don't worry for life.</sentence><sentence id="155">It's just me; let us in."</sentence><sentence id="156">I thought two men came in, but my brother tells me actually were five or six.</sentence><sentence id="157">Uh and then, I mean, they were very unpleasant.</sentence><sentence id="158">And uh I think they kind of totally ignored all three of us, actually.</sentence><sentence id="159">They kind of rummaged through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">And I...and I...they took a lot of things; but the only thing that I specifically remember them taking is that the cook... There was a white <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where they kept uh, you know, like towels and kitchen-related things.</sentence><sentence id="161">And...and there was a uh...a tall</sentence><sentence id="163">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 5 can from these things called "pastilles," which came in either a one-tier or a three-tier kind.</sentence><sentence id="164">And this was the three-tier kind; and the cook used to save coins in it, groschen--which are sort of like pennies.</sentence><sentence id="165">And that must have been important to me, because I remember that they took that.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I was not disturbed...I don't remember being disturbed about them taking anything else.</sentence><sentence id="167">But I remember being disturbed about them taking that.</sentence><sentence id="168">And uh...so that evening is sort of like a frozen still photograph in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="169">But L...you know, then it blacks out on either side of that.</sentence><sentence id="170">Uh, and one of the things that I just recently uh said to my brother- -who has often asked me, you know, "Why do you think backwards instead of living your life forwards?"</sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, and I...1 mean, that's a hard question to answer.</sentence><sentence id="172">But about a year ago, when he asked me that, after we hung up the phone I sat down to write him a letter.</sentence><sentence id="173">I suddenly realized that I guess...I guess for him, because he has a continual memory of that era, it's perhaps a little easier.</sentence><sentence id="174">I mean, he sort of remembers what happened and then what happened and then what happened.</sentence><sentence id="175">And for me, I said to him, I feel as though there's kind of a black box there that I'm maybe constantly trying to pry open but I can't get it open.</sentence><sentence id="176">And uh I guess when I went to the reunion in June uh of the St. Louis survivors, I somehow...I suppose I was subconsciously or maybe more than subconsciously hoping that some person or some conversation or something there would just trigger something that would help to...to remind me of... But I...1 can't get it back.</sentence><sentence id="177">And uh...uh I mean, my mother used to tell me a lot about how...how much my father wanted a daughter and how fond he was of me, and...and so on.</sentence><sentence id="178">And I sort of would like to try to go back and remember what that relationship might have been like, but I can't.</sentence><sentence id="179">I can't bring it back.</sentence><sentence id="182"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*186 6</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Alright.</sentence><sentence id="221">You've moved to your father.</sentence><sentence id="222">And let's talk about what happened, as it were, on either side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">You had started...your parents had started looking for papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, or a way to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="224">What happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Uh, my father uh... And I can't seem to get straight information from anybody; but my father was one of uh quite a few children.</sentence><sentence id="231">And some people say five, some people say seven, some people say nine.</sentence><sentence id="232">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="233">I have a feeling it was either seven or nine.</sentence><sentence id="234">Uh, and there actually was a set of twins in the family.</sentence><sentence id="235">But, anyway, two of the siblings had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, uh I think maybe as early as 1920's.</sentence><sentence id="236">And there had been some talk in the family, apparently, of coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to join them.</sentence><sentence id="237">Uh, and I think as things got worse, that talk got more.</sentence><sentence id="238">Uh, but apparently my father's feeling was, you know, "Look, I'm forty years old.</sentence><sentence id="239">I don't know English.</sentence><sentence id="240">Uh, I wouldn't be able to practice dentistry or medicine in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> without extensive re-training.</sentence><sentence id="241">How can |...?</sentence><sentence id="242">And, you know, I have such a good practice here.</sentence><sentence id="243">How can I just get up and go?"</sentence><sentence id="244">Uh, well, my father never made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Uh, but anyway, they realized I think fairly late that they really had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="246">And so, uh on the morning of September 30th, 1938, my mother and father left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the morning to do a number of chores.</sentence><sentence id="247">And one of the chores was to pick up our passports, which they did.</sentence><sentence id="248">Uh, and then I guess at around lunchtime, they parted to do some separate things; and they were supposed to meet, I think, either at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of this cousin where they sometimes played cards.</sentence><sentence id="249">But anyway, they were supposed to meet in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="250">And my father never came back.</sentence><sentence id="251">And he was found dead at the bottom of a uh...a four-story <span class="DLF">stairwell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">And the story over the years has been that he had been getting increasingly</sentence><sentence id="254">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 7 depressed--especially because in August he had to close his practice and he was no longer allowed to to work.</sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, and a lot of people were committing suicide.</sentence><sentence id="256">And so I kind of grew up with uh...I mean, a very strange thing.</sentence><sentence id="257">I mean, it was kind of talked about, that he had committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="258">Uh, but uh...my mo...my mother was very, very sensitive about that; and she...she was very adamant that I never tell anybody about that.</sentence><sentence id="259">And I think, really, that must have been a a very difficult thing for me as I was growing up.</sentence><sentence id="260">But anyway, you know, I didn't really think about it very much uh either.</sentence><sentence id="261">As an adult now, as I look back and I ask people, "Well, how...?"</sentence><sentence id="262">You know, and I hear from other survivors about the horrible things that were being done to people, my question has been: "How do you know that he jumped?"</sentence><sentence id="263">And, well, you know, and they say, "Well, we don't know that he jumped.</sentence><sentence id="264">But he was very depressed, and a lot of people were committing suicide."</sentence><sentence id="265">And uh...and my brother also provides a very rational uh reason, which is that he probably thought that the family would be better off without a male.</sentence><sentence id="266">Uh, and so it seems likely that...that he did this.</sentence><sentence id="267">But I can't help always wondering, with all the other stories I hear about, could somebody have pushed him?I mean, nobody would know the difference.</sentence><sentence id="268">So I don't know what the answer to that is.</sentence><sentence id="269">But, anyway, he never came back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="313">So you and your mother now were left--this is at the end of September 1938--uh without a father and husband.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: And by the way, those passports that my mother got that morming were taken on Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="317">So...</sentence><sentence id="319"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*186 8</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="327">So we move from September to November.</sentence><sentence id="328">Kristallnacht happens.</sentence><sentence id="329">You are without <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">What did your mother do?</sentence><sentence id="331">What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="332">All of you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Uh, I think there was a lot of scurry to try to get some new passports, uh which we ultimately did.</sentence><sentence id="341">I think there was probably a lot of correspondence with the Klinghoffer family, which was my father's sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">Uh, and at some point--and I don't remember when this was, but I think I actually remember this happening--this enormous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">And my...my mother was really in, I think she was in really bad straights after my father's death.</sentence><sentence id="344">Uh, and this friend of ours who was a lawyer came and kind of supervised, I think, the packing of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">Uh, and I don't remember what went into it; but I do remember what came out of it at the other <span class="NPIP">end</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">And it was ... (Laughter) I mean, it was just a ridiculous assortment of some useful but many totally useless uh objects.</sentence><sentence id="347">But anyway, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was packed, I suppose, without much thought and in a lot of hurry and sent off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>; and it was in storage for three years until we finally came there.</sentence><sentence id="348">Uh, so I...I do think I remember the day the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was being packed.</sentence><sentence id="349">But then again, there is...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="361">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> was packed; and then what did you and your mother do, specifically?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: Well, somehow uh there was this...there was news, I guess, of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was leaving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, this St. Louis--or the St. Louis, as they call it here.</sentence><sentence id="365">Uh, and because people were</sentence><sentence id="367">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*186 9 not allowed to take money out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>--I think you were allowed four or ten dollars per person--uh I think we and a lot of people like us, who might not have bought first class tickets, uh bought first class tickets.</sentence><sentence id="368">Because you couldn't take the money anyway, so you might as well, you know, spend it on this.</sentence><sentence id="369">Uh, and so we...we got these tickets and we got these visas, uh which also cost a fair amount of money.</sentence><sentence id="370">Uh, and on...in early May of 1939, we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> uh to get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="371">Now, I don't remember anything about the voyage except, I think, I remember two things.</sentence><sentence id="372">One is that there's kind of a sense of fear that I still have whenever I have to uh go through any kind of <span class="DLF">checkpoints</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">And I think that part of that must have started at that time.</sentence><sentence id="374">And from what my brother tells me it was very scary in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, because you didn't know, you know, were you going to get on?</sentence><sentence id="375">Was something going to happen before you get on got on?</sentence><sentence id="376">And so on.</sentence><sentence id="377">Uh, and the other thing is that I remember and still have a little white sun-suit uh that I that I was wearing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>; and I just happen to remember--again, it's like a still photograph of me in this little uh white sun-suit with little shorts and discreet cover-ups on the...in the chest region. (</sentence><sentence id="378">Laughter) Uh, and then I don't remember anything else from from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">But uh...I mean, I know that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, of course, came to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and we were not allowed in.</sentence><sentence id="380">Uh, and my brother tells me that uh this lawyer, whose name was [Kleinfeld (ph)], uh actually had already been in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> at that the time that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> docked.</sentence><sentence id="381">And he rode out on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come and see us.</sentence><sentence id="382">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: Who was the lawyer?</sentence><sentence id="405">Was he a connection with you personally, or with your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: Well, we were quite friendly with them then when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">But I think</sentence><sentence id="411">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 10 we were friends...I'm not sure that our parents were such good friends.</sentence><sentence id="412">I have a feeling that the friendship might have come about through the friendship between their son and my brother, but I'm not sure about that.</sentence><sentence id="413">But they certainly figured in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="414">I mean, L...I remem...they were always talked about.</sentence><sentence id="415">Uh, so he came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, to...to see us, apparently; and then, I mean, what--(coughing) excuse me--what happened on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is...is of course well-known, historically.</sentence><sentence id="416">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was turned back, and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">And that's when I start to have much more coherent memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Tell us what happened when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked.</sentence><sentence id="431">What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="434">A: You mean, when we got back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: When you got back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="438">A: Uh, well, we ended up first at uh a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in uh centrally...<span class="REGION">central France</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

(</sentence><sentence id="451">Laughter) Uh, uh the things I remember from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>: uh, I remember where our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was--it was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the side.</sentence><sentence id="452">And uh...and I remember some fairly dramatic things.</sentence><sentence id="453">I remember having this little so-called boyfriend that I guess I played with.</sentence><sentence id="454">Uh... What I remember much more dramatically are two things.</sentence><sentence id="455">Uh, well, first off, there are some trivial things I remember.</sentence><sentence id="456">I remember my mother was always very neat and clean.</sentence><sentence id="457">Uh, and I remember that my mother was really horrified at the lack of cleanliness in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and that there were cats running around on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">food preparation tables</span>.</sentence><sentence id="458">Uh, and I also remember that she was absolutely horrified because there was no place to bathe or shower in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="459">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>, but no, you know, <span class="INT_SPACE">bathing rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="460">And so my mother apparently asked the woman who ran the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where the town bathing facilities were; and the woman apparently didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="461">And my mother was totally horrified by that.</sentence><sentence id="462">And uh, oh, for years later my mother always did talk about "You don't know how much perfume this lady wore," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="463">So I remember trivia like that, and I remember somehow running around.</sentence><sentence id="464">And I remember uh...I remember once these two older girls sort of held me and made me watch while they were killing uh a chicken that was going to be used for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="465">And...and that was really...1 remember that with great horror.</sentence><sentence id="466">You know, I didn't want to watch that, and they sort of forced me.</sentence><sentence id="467">Uh, so I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="468">But the more dramatic things that I remember is that one morning we woke up and there uh was this incredible commotion <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="469">And there were uh shots; and, I mean, I didn't know that they were shots, but that's what they were.</sentence><sentence id="470">And the Germans had come in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>.</sentence><sentence id="471">And uh so, for I guess what must have been a couple of weeks we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and uh a lot of the German soldiers either... I don't know if they also lived</sentence><sentence id="473">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 12 there, but they certainly were around all the time and they had meals there.</sentence><sentence id="474">And one of the things that I remember, to this day, being incredibly puzzled about--because at this point uh I was only about five and a half or so--uh is that I was... First of all, you have to understand I was always a very "good girl," and I always did everything I was told.</sentence><sentence id="475">Uh, and I was told that under no circumstances was I to let on that I spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="476">Now, how they expected to perpetuate this hoax I don't know; because my mother spoke no French.</sentence><sentence id="477">My brother had had French lessons in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, so he probably did have some command of French.</sentence><sentence id="478">But I was kind of cute as a little girl, and the soldiers would come up and talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="479">And I remember very clearly continually saying, as they spoke to me in German, "Je ne comprends pas.</sentence><sentence id="480">Je ne comprends pas."</sentence><sentence id="481">And I remember also thinking that there was something very funny about, I guess, having always been taught that you're not supposed to lie and here I was being instructed to tell this out-and-out lie.</sentence><sentence id="482">And also nobody explained to me why I was telling this lie.</sentence><sentence id="483">And so I was really very perplexed, I think, by this whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="484">But I did exactly what I was told.</sentence><sentence id="485">And I remember the soldiers saying all these things to me--which I, of course, understood perfectly--but just saying "Je ne comprends pas."</sentence><sentence id="486">So that was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="487">Another thing... Oh, even before that time, there was one other thing I remember.</sentence><sentence id="488">There was an air raid one night, and I...somehow L...I got away from my mother and I ran <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="489">And they had to come and retrieve me.</sentence><sentence id="490">I somehow thought it was interesting, or fun, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="491">Uh, but anyway, uh...so for the two weeks or so that we stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>, in the morning the Germans would do these...1 don't know.</sentence><sentence id="492">Whatever you call them--you know, maneuvers or something.</sentence><sentence id="493">They'd march around the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in formation, with their big boots and things.</sentence><sentence id="494">And uh my mother and my brother and I would watch from</sentence><sentence id="496">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 13 the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">And there was one soldier...and I don't remember his face, but I remember, I remember his form.</sentence><sentence id="498">And I remember that he had sort of wavy sandy-colored hair.</sentence><sentence id="499">And I...can't help wondering, in retrospect, maybe he didn't even know I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="500">I mean, or maybe he did.</sentence><sentence id="501">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="502">I always sort of in the past assumed that he knew.</sentence><sentence id="503">But now I think, "Well, you know, maybe he didn't know."</sentence><sentence id="504">Who knows?</sentence><sentence id="505">But he threw me candies uh on a number of occasions.</sentence><sentence id="506">And my mother was sure they were poisoned, and...but I ate them anyway.</sentence><sentence id="507">And here lam.</sentence><sentence id="508">And then, on one of the last days we were there, he brought me a little doll.</sentence><sentence id="509">And I think that interaction through; I think that interaction very, very strongly colored my life attitudes.</sentence><sentence id="510">Uh, because I think...I think even then, you know, I somehow must have known that these were the bad guys.</sentence><sentence id="511">But this guy, who I have a feeling might have been you know eighteen or nineteen, uh was just nice, you know; and he was nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="512">Uh, and...and maybe I jump to conclusions on very naive grounds; but several years later, when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and kids would and...and their parents ask me, you know, really ridiculous things to say to a child--like, uh, "How do you like <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="513">And, "Do you hate the Germans?"</sentence><sentence id="514">And I remember always saying, "No, I don't hate the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="515">There are good Germans, and there are bad Germans."</sentence><sentence id="516">And I ...1 mean maybe this is simplistic, but I've always thought that it really had to do with this one soldier that somehow made me get a...a very sensible attitude, even though I was so young, about the differences between people.</sentence><sentence id="517">And I've always sort of very fondly remembered that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="607">Q: What is your perception of your mother during that period?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="609">A: I think...I think in retrospect--and I wish I had realized this more when she was still around-- my mother must have really, basically, been an incredibly strong person to have gone through that.</sentence><sentence id="610">Because when I try to think back on it, I often think L..you know, I don't think I could have done the things that she did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="613">Q: That's not what I'm asking.</sentence><sentence id="614">I'm asking what your memory of her...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: I...1 know what you're asking, and I...I really had to give that preamble; because my...my sense of my mother during those years, and...and many years later, is that that she somehow never got it all together except for the practical things.</sentence><sentence id="618">That she somehow was so...I'm not sure what the right word is, but maybe almost frantic.</sentence><sentence id="619">I mean, she was... And who knows?</sentence><sentence id="620">I mean, maybe I would have been the same way.</sentence><sentence id="621">But I mean, she really...she was in mourning for my father for the rest of her life.</sentence><sentence id="622">And she only died in 1982 at age, you know, 84.</sentence><sentence id="623">I guess she was a woman who already had learned something like five languages, but she could not learn French.</sentence><sentence id="624">You know, it was not just there at that time.</sentence><sentence id="625">Uh, and I think uh... I wish I could remember the German word that that she used to use a lot.</sentence><sentence id="626">That she was just uh...she just didn't...she sort of didn't know what to do, you know, with herself or what was</sentence><sentence id="628">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 15 going on, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="629">Uh, and I think the... What she had always told me was that after the Germans came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>, that my brother--who was uh about thirteen at that time, I guess, uh or twelve or thirteen--said one day that he was not staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>, and that whether she left or not he was leaving.</sentence><sentence id="630">Now, I'm not sure whether my brother really said that in those terms.</sentence><sentence id="631">What my brother tells me is that there was a meeting of the twenty-odd some refugees in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and that it was decided that they should get the Hell out of there.</sentence><sentence id="632">Uh, and there were...there was only one family, or possibly a family and one other person, who decided not to go.</sentence><sentence id="633">And that family uh is the family of the two sisters that I showed you the picture of before.</sentence><sentence id="634">And it was a mistake, because they didn't get here until 1947.</sentence><sentence id="635">But anyway, so I don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="636">What I do remember is that one night we left everything that we owned--which was not much, but we did have, you know, suitcases and valises and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="637">We left everything, and we left in the dark of night.</sentence><sentence id="638">And I think I have a...my recollection is that it was like midnight, uh with nothing except my brother's violin.</sentence><sentence id="639">And this group of us went; and somehow, in a way that was not quite kosher, got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that went to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="640">Uh, and then uh so I remem.... I remember walking to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loudun</span>, but I don't remember anything of this trip.</sentence><sentence id="641">But what my brother tells me is that uh when we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span>--which I guess was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.580222" long="0.340389">Poitiers</span>--and we had to go through this uh...you know, whatever you do at <span class="DLF">borders</span>, uh that at that time, uh which was now 1940, the lower echelon people in these <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were still French people rather than Germans.</sentence><sentence id="642">And apparently one woman in this group of twenty went up to this woman in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and said, "Look, you know, I've really got to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, because I'm here and my husband is already on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>."</sentence><sentence id="643">And so this woman said, "Yeah, alright."</sentence><sentence id="644">You know, and</sentence><sentence id="646"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 16 stamped her whatever you needed to get stamped.</sentence><sentence id="647">And then she turned and said, "You know, that's also the situation for all these other people.</sentence><sentence id="648">They also have somebody else waiting on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>."</sentence><sentence id="649">And apparently this woman, in a rather nonchalant fashion, said, "Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="650">OK."</sentence><sentence id="651">And so we all got across.</sentence><sentence id="652">And we went to somehow uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>, and now that's where my memory picks up again.</sentence><sentence id="653">Uh, the first...I think the first night we slept in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>; and I...1 remember, I think I slept on a...on a scale.</sentence><sentence id="654">You know, the kind of thing you weigh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage</span> on.</sentence><sentence id="655">Uh, and then the next night--and I thought it was just one night, but my brother tells me it was about six weeks--we were sent to sleep in an abandoned uh <span class="BUILDING">circus arena</span> that was...I guess it was stone.</sentence><sentence id="656">And uh...and I remember waking up the first morning we were there and being all black and blue and sore uh from just sleeping on this...on this stone.</sentence><sentence id="657">Uh, but my brother tells me that we were there, as I said, for six weeks and that people graduated.</sentence><sentence id="658">You know, gradually people found <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live, and so you kind of got to move to the better <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="659">And then, apparently, the...the most desirable <span class="NPIP">place</span> was around the periphery of the <span class="BUILDING">arena</span>.</sentence><sentence id="660">There were these uh...what I call orange crate make-shift <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> that had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span> in them.</sentence><sentence id="661">And so that was... for the last few days we were there, I guess, we got to sleep on...on those.</sentence><sentence id="662">And then, uh somehow there was a...this Jewish committee that found...you know, was helping the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="663">And they found uh a uh <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I think had been a <span class="INT_SPACE">pool hall</span>, and there was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that must have been...I mean, it was really not a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="664">It might have been maybe twenty feet by twenty feet, or twenty-five feet by twenty-five feet.</sentence><sentence id="665">Certainly not...not any bigger than that.</sentence><sentence id="666">Uh, and there were about thirty women who slept in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="667">And then, right above that, there was another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where all the...the men slept.</sentence><sentence id="668">And I don't remember there being any other</sentence><sentence id="670"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 17 female children except for me.</sentence><sentence id="671">And I could be wrong about that, but I have no recollection of anything but adults.</sentence><sentence id="672">And my brother slept upstairs with the men; and I have a feeling he might have been the only, you know, minor in that group as well.</sentence><sentence id="673">But then, I mean, this is where I really start to remember.</sentence><sentence id="674">I mean, I remember this <span class="NPIP">place</span> well.</sentence><sentence id="675">And actually, I went back there in 1963 to visit it.</sentence><sentence id="676">And uh so we slept in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>; and at night we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span>, and we'd line them up.</sentence><sentence id="677">It was body to body on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">Uh, and then in the morning, they would get piled up against the side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">And there were all these sort of orange <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crates</span>, you know, really wooden kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crates</span> that got pulled out.</sentence><sentence id="680">And we sat on those and...and ate off them and...and so on.</sentence><sentence id="681">And uh so we were in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for...I don't know, quite a long time.</sentence><sentence id="682">And I began going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">My first year of schooling was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>; and I remember walking to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I remember the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">And I still have my three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">notebooks</span> from that year.</sentence><sentence id="685">And I remember the teacher, uh who I remember as a quite not very pleasant woman.</sentence><sentence id="686">And uh she seemed very old to me them.</sentence><sentence id="687">I mean, she had sort of graying hair, uh you know, with a very harshly drawn back with a bun; and she sat up on a dias.</sentence><sentence id="688">And uh, I mean, I remember quite a few things from this; but two things that stand out in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="689">Uh one is that every morning she would come down every <span class="DLF">aisle</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> with a ruler and examine your head to see if you [had] nits or cooties--uh, lice, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="690">And uh I don't think it ever occurred to her that, by doing that, that she was actually spreading this.</sentence><sentence id="691">And so sure enough, one day I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and one of the women spotted that I had lice.</sentence><sentence id="692">And I mean, my recollection is that there must have been five women every day who kind of attacked me and washed my hair with kerosene, and then combed it mercilessly with, you know, these incredibly fine-toothed combs until they cleaned my head</sentence><sentence id="694">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 18 out.</sentence><sentence id="695">So that was kind of horrible.</sentence><sentence id="696">The other thing that I remember is I was ...1 was very anxious to be very good in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I did very well at almost everything except penmanship.</sentence><sentence id="697">I mean, penmanship was so stressed in that thing, in that system or whatever; and I remember this teacher constantly after me, because on French 1's and s's you're supposed to have this little bump, you know at the top.</sentence><sentence id="698">And I could never quite get that right.</sentence><sentence id="699">I mean, she did...she accepted all the others.</sentence><sentence id="700">I've never had a good penmanship, but she accepted everything else.</sentence><sentence id="701">But she was constantly after me about that little, you know, squiggle that I couldn't get right.</sentence><sentence id="702">So I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="703">The other thing that I remember is that everything was, in terms of food, was incredibly difficult to get.</sentence><sentence id="704">And so uh I...my brother was too old to get milk, but I was allowed to have about this much milk in uh something that sort of looked like a straightened version of a coke bottle.</sentence><sentence id="705">And my mother insisted that we share that.</sentence><sentence id="706">And so, every morning we would go down and collect this... this milk.</sentence><sentence id="707">Uh, the thing that I remember with great pain-- and it...I think it's only as an adult that I really have added to that a kind of feeling of maybe resentment--uh because I was cute I got sent into bakeries to beg for bread.</sentence><sentence id="708">And the <span class="DLF">line</span> was, "I've got uh...I have...1 have money, and I have ration coupons.</sentence><sentence id="709">But uh..." Or maybe we didn't have ration coupons, whatever it was, you know.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1352">A: Well, uh I think I was kind of a...in some sense, a dual personality kid.</sentence><sentence id="1353">I mean, I was...I liked to play, and I was kind of, you know, fun-loving and...on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1354">Uh, but there was this other side of me that was serious and thoughtful, and I guess introspective and a lot of other things.</sentence><sentence id="1355">And...and lonesome.</sentence><sentence id="1356">Uh, not the kind of lonesome that... I wrote a poem about this, actually.</sentence><sentence id="1357">More thinking about my mother; but not the kind of lonesome that goes away when other people are around, but just a kind of inherent feeling of...1 don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1358">Uh, I mean, only now in recent years I very often think that the only way I can explain it is, you know, maybe it's what happens to a kid... I mean, what happens when a four year-old kid is</sentence><sentence id="1360"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 31 told that she's never going to see her father again.</sentence><sentence id="1361">Especially, you know, having been told that...that he was incredibly affectionate to me.</sentence><sentence id="1362">I mean, what does that do?</sentence><sentence id="1363">What does that mean?</sentence><sentence id="1364">Uh, so I mean...I mean, I still am basically...I...you know, I love to dance and I like to sing.</sentence><sentence id="1365">I'm a very uh...and I love to tell jokes.</sentence><sentence id="1366">And my brother and I love to tell jokes.</sentence><sentence id="1367">Uh uh...but there's a very incredibly serious part of my brother, which is much more evident I think in him than in me.</sentence><sentence id="1368">But there's a very morbid part of me also.</sentence><sentence id="1369">I mean, it's a...I don't, you know, it's...it's like a little sideline, but it never goes away.</sentence><sentence id="1370">So uh...and then I think, I mean, my mother certainly tried very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1371">But I think she did and said some things that were not really very good for kids growing up.</sentence><sentence id="1372">She always told us that we were different.</sentence><sentence id="1373">I don't think that was very good for us.</sentence><sentence id="1374">Uh, we were supposed to be "aristocratic"--you know, in quotes.</sentence><sentence id="1375">I mean, that was a myth.</sentence><sentence id="1376">I don't...we were not aristocratic in Europe, either.</sentence><sentence id="1377">I mean, we were just reasonable, middle-classed people.</sentence><sentence id="1378">Uh, but uh so I always felt different.</sentence><sentence id="1379">I felt different, anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1380">I mean, you know, I come, here I am at age seven learning my third language, and sort of--if you consider the whole Judaic thing--my fourth culture uh by age seven.</sentence><sentence id="1381">And I remember coming to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>; and you know, all the little girls and boys around me are, you know, obviously talking about me.</sentence><sentence id="1382">And I can't understand what they're saying.</sentence><sentence id="1383">Well, I learned English really fast, let me tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1384">Uh, but I always felt different.</sentence><sentence id="1385">Well, you know, the more different you feel, somehow you stay different and you become different.</sentence><sentence id="1386">And uh uh...and to this day, I still... mean, no matter...1 mean, I always feel different.</sentence><sentence id="1387">And I think I never thought of it, but there was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist that they interviewed in the [Boston] Globe; and he said, "I always felt a little different, and it always hurt a little."</sentence><sentence id="1388">And when I read that, I thought, "That's...that's</sentence><sentence id="1390"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 32 really...that describes me."</sentence><sentence id="1391">Because I think subconsciously, somehow I've always wanted to belong to certain, you know...I don't know-- whatever, you know, groups of things.</sentence><sentence id="1392">Not ever to belong to...uh, I mean, I rarely sign things and I don't want to belong.</sentence><sentence id="1393">I don't uh... don't like being associated with divisive things.</sentence><sentence id="1394">I mean, I have very mixed feelings about, you know, even about belonging to the...the quality of being Jewish, or whatever you want to call it.</sentence><sentence id="1395">Uh, because I think that's very divisive.</sentence><sentence id="1396">I mean, I...you know, all the divisive things that have happened in history have happened because people are...you know, belong to...to some of these things.</sentence><sentence id="1397">So that's not the kind of belonging that I want.</sentence><sentence id="1398">But the...belonging to...to, for example, uh... Oh, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1399">Within an academic environment, uh people who have similar interests or people who like to do some activity or something.</sentence><sentence id="1400">And I always...I mean, I'm 55 years old but I still always feel that there is something different about me compared to all these other people.</sentence><sentence id="1401">And it always...in some strange way, there's a difference.</sentence><sentence id="1402">Uh, and then, of course, when I was little, the difference became greatly exacerbated because there was such an an emphasis put on learning and studying and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1403">And that was not the favorite activity of most of the other kids at <span class="DLF">1092 President Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1404">And so the other kids would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and uh go out and, you know, play--this, that and the other thing.</sentence><sentence id="1405">And I would very often...I mean, I did play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="1406">But I did a Hell of a lot of homework.</sentence><sentence id="1407">And in retrospect, I think I did a lot more homework than was ever assigned.</sentence><sentence id="1408">Uh, so...and I, you know, I just...I mean, those kids were different.</sentence><sentence id="1409">They were not interested.</sentence><sentence id="1410">And I, at some very early age, decided I was going to be a scientist and I was going to do this and that and the other thing.</sentence><sentence id="1411">And they, I mean, they didn't have any aspirations.</sentence><sentence id="1412">And uh I suppose part of that was enhanced, in that, you know, I mean my mother just kind of</sentence><sentence id="1414">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 33 expected that we would do things and she knew that they were not going to do things.</sentence><sentence id="1415">And uh...and I think she did not let that pass quietly by.</sentence><sentence id="1416">Uh, so anyway, I uh...you know, I was...I played and I uh...but I didn't do any...I was not allowed to do anything dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1417">And that included uh... My mother used to have a fit.</sentence><sentence id="1418">I mean, in those days people thought that if you walked up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>--and we lived on a fourth-floor walk-up--that you'd get a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="1419">So you know, so it was a major issue about my walking, you know, every time I had to walk up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1420">Uh, I was not allowed to uh ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, uh when the other kids were learning to ride <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>; and I think...I think partly that was a financial matter.</sentence><sentence id="1421">You know, I mean, it took a quarter an hour to rent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1422">Uh, but I think mostly it was a safety matter.</sentence><sentence id="1423">But one of the things that happened very early on is that uh... mean, I had this brother who was almost eight years older, who was a very...we were very close; and I had my mother, who was a very worrisome Jewish mother.</sentence><sentence id="1424">And I think very early on, there were many times when my mother would say "Black," and my brother would say, "White."</sentence><sentence id="1425">And at a very early age, I think I discerned that my brother's responses came from the head and my mother's responses came straight from the gut.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And that, obviously, from the head was better.</sentence><sentence id="1427">And uh so whenever there was...you know, whenever I had to make a decision between the two opinions, I almost invariably did what my brother said.</sentence><sentence id="1428">Uh, and he was very protective of me; and we had a very sort of uh weird family situation, probably, in retrospect.</sentence><sentence id="1429">But it was a very uh uh loving, and very uh you know sort of...we were always, you know, sort of kissing and that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And, by and large, people did not yell, and...and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1431">But if my brother heard my mother say something to me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, because L...he had his own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but I studied in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, uh he would be right there.</sentence><sentence id="1434">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 34 "What are you saying to this child?"</sentence><sentence id="1435">And uh I remember funny things, like uh if I had a cold uh my mother would say, "Well, maybe you should stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and stay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1436">And my brother said, "You take two handkerchiefs, and hang one out to dry while you're using the other one.</sentence><sentence id="1437">And go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1438">Well, I mean, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the two handkerchiefs; and uh uh...so and I guess...I guess, I probably spent or tried to spend and probably did spend a certain amount of time with my brother's friends, who were much older than me.</sentence><sentence id="1439">I mean, they were adults and I was still a kid.</sentence><sentence id="1440">And I think they were trying to get rid of me a certain amount of the time.</sentence><sentence id="1441">I mean, they did...my brother took me to my first <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1442">And one of his friends took me to my first ballet, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1443">Uh, and I remember once my mother getting involved, because my brother didn't want to take me someplace he was going with a friend.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And my mother - I remember this is so ridiculous - my mother said, "You can't go, because Fred is big enough to walk between the rain drops but you aren't."

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1550">A: Well, uh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1551">I think maybe I'd like to mention that I talk about this very easily now, but that all the times when my mother was still alive and that she wanted to talk about some of these things, I really didn't want to hear about it.</sentence><sentence id="1552">I didn't want to listen.</sentence><sentence id="1553">Uh, first of all, because she would get very emotional, and I... And I mean, in retrospect, I couldn't tolerate</sentence><sentence id="1555">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 35 that.</sentence><sentence id="1556">Uh, and I know sometimes now when I get emotional about something, I can see my kids responding in the same way.</sentence><sentence id="1557">I mean, that [they] don't really need this.</sentence><sentence id="1558">Uh, and so I really went through very many years, essentially, not thinking very much about this and making believe it never happened.</sentence><sentence id="1559">And when the other kids or other people would ask me, "Well, what effect do you think your background had on you?"</sentence><sentence id="1560">I would say, "Well, I was too young and I don't remember anything, and I don't think it had any effect on me."</sentence><sentence id="1561">And I think uh--and I've been trying to write about some of these issues--I think that there's a certain age, and I see this in other people, when you have a period of great strength and you're sort of building your life and it's very easy to sort of not look back and push everything aside.</sentence><sentence id="1562">And then I think there comes another period, when for me and for I think for other people also, somehow the back...background comes back to haunt you.</sentence><sentence id="1563">And it wasn't really until after our kids were born, and...and uh you know maybe when I was about 35, that I started noticing that I...that certain things I did were not really logically explainable by...by things that were happening then.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And that the only logical explanation of why I was doing certain things in that way, or doing them at all, had to do probably with some of the things that had happened very early in life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1565">And you know, my father disappearing and uh...and things that happened in... in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and uh...and in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoges</span>, and uh... and that whole business of sort always being on the run for those years, and being scared, and uh... And I think there is a lot of interesting material uh to explore there.</sentence><sentence id="1566">Uh, and uh...and to explore with other people who have had similar experiences.</sentence><sentence id="1567">Uh, I think the unfortunate thing--and being a scientist, | mean, I would always like to have a controlled experiment, and of course there is no controlled experiment--but trying to pick</sentence><sentence id="1569"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 36 apart.</sentence><sentence id="1570">Uh, and of course it's only conjectural, and it's like playing pick-up sticks; but somehow trying to define for myself, you know, what things that have stayed with me are really due to the things that happened because of the war and the things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1571">And what things are just because...you know, I mean everybody's parents by and large are crazy anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1572">Right?</sentence><sentence id="1573">And...and so you, your parents uh somehow inflict on you uh some of that craziness that they have.</sentence><sentence id="1574">Uh, and it's hard to tell, because of course I don't know what kind of person my mother was before the war started.</sentence><sentence id="1575">And it's only in recent years, and actually since she's died, that I've really thought enough about this to to realize that, you know, she might have been and probably was a very sort of, you know, happy carefree person in many ways uh but I never knew her.</sentence><sentence id="1576">I mean, my mother wore black for years and years and years; and then she finally switched to navy.</sentence><sentence id="1577">And it was, you know, it was only very very late, when I was already essentially an adult that she would ever wear anything that was red, or uh uh...and she always, you know, all the years she lived she kept up on [my] <span class="DLF">father's grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1578">She always you know, lit a uh yahrzeit candle.</sentence><sentence id="1579">Uh uh she she always uh...you know, I mean, she always I think in...in many ways--in her thoughts, at least--she always lived in her past.</sentence><sentence id="1580">Not...not in her actions, but you know... "If I only had my sister to talk to," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1581">And then one other thing that I should have mentioned, uh because I...1 do remember this and it was very dramatic was right after the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="1582">There was a blue letter that arrived from...I think it was from a cousin of my mother's who ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>--and I don't know if he's still alive or not--uh sort of delineating what had happened to many of our relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1583">And I mean, that, you know, I remember it as being horrendous; but now, when I think back, that must have been just such an incredible</sentence><sentence id="1585"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 37 nightmare to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1586">Because the news in that letter, as you can imagine, was...I mean, essentially everybody was killed, and...and some of them in rather grotesque ways.</sentence><sentence id="1587">Uh and I...1 guess I wish I could have been a little bit more understanding of me in relation to my background, and I think that would have lead to...to my having a better understanding and appreciation of my mother uh during those years.</sentence><sentence id="1588">Uh, my mother and I, by the way, got along very well uh until the other girls started dating.</sentence><sentence id="1589">And then she got... END OF TAPE ...like our live-in baby sitters.</sentence><sentence id="1590">And I had my very strong, very very democratic ideas about uh...you know, the way those people should be done, should be treated.</sentence><sentence id="1591">And I...and I think in some sense there was kind of...I guess, she verbalized it often.</sentence><sentence id="1592">She felt that we treated our live-in baby sitters better than we treated her.</sentence><sentence id="1593">And that was probably true, because they didn't sort of interfere in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="1594">And she somehow tried to continue to be a mother when she should have become a friend.</sentence><sentence id="1595">And I think...I mean, in retrospect now that was because she was very lonesome.</sentence><sentence id="1596">So there's a lot more, I suppose, to be said; but maybe I'll write it sometime.</sentence></p></dialogue>

But anyway, they...they were - I don't know, they just didn't uh...they were not so interesting to me when I was a little girl.</sentence><sentence id="1670">And I did occasionally go to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1671">But the thing that I remember just incredibly about Leon uh is that, somewhere along the years there, uh my mother said I could have some piano lessons with this absolutely horrible teacher.</sentence><sentence id="1672">I mean, it was a dollar an hour.</sentence><sentence id="1673">And I don't know whether that was a lot in those days - | think it was not even a lot in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1674">But she was...she was not a very good teacher.</sentence><sentence id="1675">Uh but anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1676">And I only took lessons for maybe a year or something, but somehow in the course of that year--or maybe it was a little longer--there were two recitals where I played, you know, a diddley something-- "In My <span class="DLF">Country Garden</span>," or something-- for you know thirty seconds.</sentence><sentence id="1677">At one of these <span class="BUILDING">recitals</span> uh... and you have to understand that in those days I could never have anything that any of the other kids had, and I rationalized it very well.</sentence><sentence id="1678">I always said I didn't want any of the other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1679">But uh at Easter time, you know, the other kids would get new suits, and I...J usually didn't, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1682">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 39 Leon Klinghoffer appeared at my little diddley piano recital with this unbelievable bouquet of pink peonies, you know; which are these really hugh full flowers.</sentence><sentence id="1683">And I...I just will never forget that.</sentence><sentence id="1684">I mean, that was...that made quite an impression.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And just a few months ago, I was thumbing through one of my mother's old photo albums and on one of the last pages this, there was this bunch of flower petals, and in one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> one of these flower petals - you know, they were all brown, there was still a little bit of pink and I suddenly realized that those were probably the left-over of the pink peonies uh so that was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1686">Then I remember Leon Klinghoffer went into the army and I remember hearing that he uh I don't know whether - but anyway something happened and I guess he was in Europe and he became hard of hearing in one ear uh and then he came back and he met this very attractive doll-like woman who he married, Marilyn Klinghoffer.</sentence><sentence id="1687">Uh and I remember sort of thinking, because he was not really very attractive physically, and uh I think he already then maybe had a receding hairline and uh so he must have looked very old to me, and here, you know, he married this incredibly uh pretty uh woman uh and they went on to have kids.</sentence><sentence id="1688">And my mother kind of kept contact and went to the wedding and I don't remember where I was at the time, but I I didn't go and I didn't see Leon Klinghoffer for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1689">I did occasionally, like in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> I needed something and I went to his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy it and uh but about what must have been maybe 1983 maybe one of the other members of the family had a bar mitzvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worcester</span> and Leon came.</sentence><sentence id="1690">And by that time, he had already had a stroke.</sentence><sentence id="1691">Uh, and he pulled me over to him--and I remember it just brought tears to my eyes, even then--he pulled me over.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And his speech was quite slurred, because of the stroke, at that time; and we just talked for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="1693">And he said, "You know, I want you to know that</sentence><sentence id="1695"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030* 186 40 your mother was really a very good woman."</sentence><sentence id="1696">Uh, and I...1 remember being incredibly impressed that night uh by talking to Marilyn.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And she was still so attractive-looking; and thinking, you know, "What a fantastic lady this is!</sentence><sentence id="1698">I mean, she takes care of him, she works..."

Anyway, I went down to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">funeral</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1718">And that whole</sentence><sentence id="1720">USHMM Archives RG-50.030* 186 41 family is very...they are very closed-mouthed about when things go wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1721">I mean, in contrast to the people that I hang around with, who...who are very...you know, they sort of talk about this one's got this and this one just had an operation and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1722">And so, when I was going down to the funeral, somebody--it was Dorothy, I think--said to me, "Well, you know, I think Marilyn's been ill."</sentence><sentence id="1723">And because I have this morbid streak, I mean, immediately the worst thing crossed my mind.</sentence><sentence id="1724">But L...you know, nobody had said anything.</sentence><sentence id="1725">And so... But then after the funeral, everybody went to Marilyn's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>; and she just looked like living <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1726">And I, as I was leaving to go back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I...I kissed her good-bye.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And 1...and I said, you know, "Well, maybe you'd like to come up and visit us, or something.</sentence><sentence id="1728">And I'll see you again."</sentence><sentence id="1729">And she sort of looked at me; and she said, you know, "OK, darling.</sentence><sentence id="1730">And uh...and I...I thought, "Something is wrong with this woman."</sentence><sentence id="1731">And a minute later, I said, you know, "Don't be silly!"</sentence><sentence id="1732">I mean, you know, how would you look if you had just been through this whole thing, and...and your husband had been shot, and so on?</sentence><sentence id="1733">And uh...and then nobody said anything.</sentence><sentence id="1734">And then I remember, in...I guess it was in December, we wake up to the news; and the minute the news went on, the first thing was that Marilyn Klinghoffer had died of cancer.</sentence><sentence id="1735">And, you know, it was just...well, I...1 never knew her that well.</sentence><sentence id="1736">And I just...you know, I just felt very sad, because I somehow thought that I'd like to get to know her better and I never did.</sentence><sentence id="1737">And all those other good things.</sentence><sentence id="1738">But, so uh...that's the connection.</sentence></p></dialogue>
