<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, we, we, we really began to...because the the Utrecht students...they were before us.</sentence><sentence id="277">They, they, they, they were, uh, trying to get, uh, children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span>" and as they were living in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span>, it was fast.</sentence><sentence id="278">They always had to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">It's not so far, but anyway...they weren't living here, so they contacted us and they said, if, if, uh, we should collaborate..."You, you look for the children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">You know the families," and because we didn't only have children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">We had children right from the, from the parents too of course and that goes mouth by mouth.</sentence><sentence id="282">I mean someone knew that we were taking care of children and, uh, they informed the parents and we got...contacted.</sentence><sentence id="283">It was not only the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">But they asked us and that's why, why we we started.</sentence><sentence id="285">They couldn't handle it.</sentence><sentence id="286">It was too much, and they asked us to, to uh, fetch the children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> and fetch other children.</sentence><sentence id="287">So, sometimes we hided the children ourselves or we gave them to Utrecht organization--independent who, who had <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but in...let's say a year later we were completely independent and they had their own organization.</sentence><sentence id="288">We worked together but we, we looked for <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ourselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="631">A: There was a list.</sentence><sentence id="632">They, they they operated different.</sentence><sentence id="633">Sometimes..but a real razzia, in my opinion, is a, uh, search of all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and not on a certain address.</sentence><sentence id="634">Of course, they they, they, they, uh, took, uh, Jews from addresses, but that was individually.</sentence><sentence id="635">They went to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with three or four people, and they... and they rang the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and they saw they were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then they took them.</sentence><sentence id="636">But that's not the same as a razzia.</sentence><sentence id="637">A razzia is...they wanted to, to, to...because there were a lot of people already hiding in, in, in, in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, so they, they found that too, of course.</sentence><sentence id="638">If you had no identification, no persoonbewijs, they took you.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="806">Q: Then what happened to the child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="808">A: That's a very strange story because the girl who had adopted her or, or recognized it as, it as her as her son was one...was visiting the, the parents every...every month to give all kinds of things: coupons, uh, bread coupons, meat coupons...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="832">Q: Would you visit the children at all once they were placed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="834">A: The girls did, but once in a while--not every month.</sentence><sentence id="835">That would be too much.</sentence><sentence id="836">And for instance, we had a <span class="BUILDING">center</span> in, in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span>, in the South, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tienray</span> where we had 120 children and where there was a Jewish student and some others who stayed there and took care of all the children, so there you didn't have to, to go.</sentence><sentence id="837">We just brought the the children 5 there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="874">A: Uh, yeah...that's a question that you can only ask after the war.</sentence><sentence id="875">In the war you never asked what they were.</sentence><sentence id="876">If you had a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, you had a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="877">You didn't ask what they were.</sentence><sentence id="878">We didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="879">We didn't care where...we were too happy to have an address.</sentence><sentence id="880">If they were Hindostaans"""...it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="881">The only thing which we took care of especially, because our south connection...we had to deal with the Bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span>, that the children were not to be, uh, bap...baptized.</sentence><sentence id="882">Yeah?</sentence><sentence id="883">Is that right?</sentence><sentence id="884">Baptized.</sentence><sentence id="885">Of course, the children had to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with the other children.</sentence><sentence id="886">Otherwise it would be too suspicious, and the children loved the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="887">It's, it's really a great show, you know (laughter).</sentence><sentence id="888">So there was always the danger that they, they, they wanted to be baptized and and some of the the, the pastors would have loved to do that, but from, from the Bishop there was absolutely a, a, uh...it was forbidden to, to do that and in, in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tienray</span> where we had these...all these children, there was not one baptism.</sentence><sentence id="889">There have been cases, of course, that pastors disobeyed the orders of the Bishop and there there will be some baptized, but it was absolutely minimum.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="906">Q: Why did you decide first to work with helping to save the children rather than adults?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="908">"4 Hindus.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="910">A: No...it didn't happen that way.</sentence><sentence id="911">We were approached by the Utrecht people about the children.</sentence><sentence id="912">So we have from the beginning in, in, in... we were working with the children and we knew that we, we couldn't do both.</sentence><sentence id="913">That would be absolutely impossible and we realized that if we had...there were...there were so many children.</sentence><sentence id="914">If, if, if I give you an example...I think that all the groups together...three or four groups, had 1200 children, which is peanuts compared to how many children there were.</sentence><sentence id="915">We couldn't do more.</sentence><sentence id="916">I mean it was...it was such a short time and you...so you have to concentrate on, on, on, on the children.</sentence><sentence id="917">If, if we didn't do it, we could...you would have done the work for children half and the work for adults half, so we decide very soon with the Utrecht group to...that we'd in principle only take care of children and let the adults be, uh, uh, hided by, by other other people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="926">Q: Was it harder working with the Utrecht group, since the NSB"?</sentence><sentence id="927">was <span class="BUILDING">headquartered</span> there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="931">That didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="932">I lived in front of the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the SD Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="933">It was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="934">It was even more better because (laughter)...yeah...just...when I looked out of my <span class="DLF">window</span> I could see the, the, the where the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, now, the Gerrit van de Veenstraat, then, the Erteupestraat, and it was the most safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> I could could be, so that doesn't matter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="940">Q: Were you ever suspected?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="952">Q: Were you or your girls ever personally suspected by them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="954">A: Yeah, but they knew, uh, uh, Piet van Doorn, but they didn't know that, that it was me.</sentence><sentence id="955">I think it worked that way.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="987">A: In the morning there was a <span class="DLF">back door</span> through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and we took the, the, the, the, the children from...by the <span class="DLF">back door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="988">And we went away.</sentence><sentence id="989">Sometimes the, the, the nurses, like Virrie Cohen, and so on, took the children on walk and we took them when they were walking, took two or three, and they came back with two or three less or four less, let's say.</sentence><sentence id="990">There were all kinds of methods to to get them out of the, the, the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="997">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="998">Because the, the, the, the...it's a mis...a misunderstanding that...that the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> was the most important, uh, source of getting children.</sentence><sentence id="999">That's not true.</sentence><sentence id="1000">| mean it was "A" source and some of the groups had more children from the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span> than the other ones.</sentence><sentence id="1001">There were always, uh, parents who wanted to, who who were hiding, who were not hid...hiding and who wanted to hide...it was very difficult to hide with your children so then they they contacted us and we took the child one or two, and, and, and took it away, so it's, it's not only the <span class="BUILDING">Creche</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1002">It's, it's...you took it right from the parents.</sentence><sentence id="1003">That was one of the reasons why I think we could do the job, because we were young and it's, it's a...if you think about it now, today, as a father or a grandfather, it was absolutely inhuman to, to, to separate the child from the parents, and I think we, we could do it because we were not parents ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1004">We...although we were very upset about it and we found it very difficult, we didn't quite realize how, how, how terrible it was, in my opinion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
