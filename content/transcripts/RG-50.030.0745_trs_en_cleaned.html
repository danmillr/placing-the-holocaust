<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="78">And did you have any friends there?</sentence><sentence id="79">Did you meet your wife in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> for instance?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: I volunteered at that time.</sentence><sentence id="106">I was out of work, looking for a job, and employers were very hesitant about hiring young men who had not had their military service, but the draft system had just kicked in a short time before that, and they did not want to train new employees for two, three, six months and then lose them to the military.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: So they declined employing young men who had not had their military training; so I decided to get my year's training over with and come back and then be able to get a job.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: And exactly what were the circumstances of that?</sentence><sentence id="114">And where I'm going with this is did you seek a commission or did you enlist, and how did you come about your commission?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: To get my commission?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="128">I got into the local Company K of the National Guard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burlington</span>, and we came down here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> and trained here for a year.</sentence><sentence id="129">And we're getting ready to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span>, and the Japanese dropped the bomb at Pearl Harbor already; so we're in (?</sentence><sentence id="130">full duration?</sentence><sentence id="131">05:29) and there's no going back to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="132">So the unit that I was with, the 43rd Division, was then prioritized to go to the <span class="REGION">Pacific</span> and start fighting the war down there.</sentence><sentence id="133">And at that time, I was chosen to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> to go to an <span class="BUILDING">offshore candidate school</span>, and I spent three months there training and became a second lieutenant my commission there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: What rank had you attained in enlisted ranks?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: A second lieutenant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="146">Just before became a second lieutenant, what rank has you attained in the rank?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: [had risen up through corporal and sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="150">I was a sergeant when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: You said you went in 1940.</sentence><sentence id="154">What--were you conscious of the fact of what was going on in Europe, and did you see a likelihood of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> entering the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="158">At that time, I did not.</sentence><sentence id="159">I could see the clouds of war in Europe, but it was still far away and really didn't see the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> getting involved in the war at that time.</sentence><sentence id="160">It was not until later on "42'43 that I began to see that they we're going to get involved in this thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: And tell us about your experience in <span class="BUILDING">officer candidate school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">What was that like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Well, it was rather difficult because I had been working with the--a supply officer in the 43rd Division, and I did not get the full extent of the basic training of the [(07:32)] that all the rest of the guys got.</sentence><sentence id="170">And so when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benning</span>, I was at a disadvantage because I had not had the basic training.</sentence><sentence id="171">And I was competing with other sergeants who had had the basic training; so I really had to do my military basic training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> during the officer candidate course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: And how did you fair there?</sentence><sentence id="176">How did you do in the end?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: In the end, I did well.</sentence><sentence id="180">And more than likely I got my commission.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Very good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: If hadn't got my commission, I'd have gone back in rank to my original <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: So you said, you know, when the Japanese did attack Pearl Harbor, that's when you realized--<span class="COUNTRY">America</span>--that we were in it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: That's correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: Well, I felt that this was going to get us into the war because the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor, but the Japanese were tied in with the Germans as the Axis powers and that, in turn, was going to draw us into the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: And, you know, I felt confident at that time that, hey, we're going to go over to Europe or to the Pacific and fight these guys, and we're going to get this thing over with maybe two or three months.</sentence><sentence id="209">That was a little optimistic.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Indeed.</sentence><sentence id="213">So when were you--when was the decision a made to send you to Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: That's kind of a long story.</sentence><sentence id="332">The people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> were very hospitable and we, being Yankee boys at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they thought it would be nice to invite the soldier boys from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> to their various <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and civic organizations where they put on dances and get togetherers with the young people of the <span class="REGION">local area</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span>, and of course we were macho guys, and we wanted to have our beer on Saturday night.</sentence><sentence id="333">And when we'd go to those dances or whatever function they were having, all they had was soft drinks, and we didn't tend to go for that.</sentence><sentence id="334">So we declined a lot of these invitations and it got to the point where nobody was going on a voluntary basis; so the army decided we can't disappoint these people.</sentence><sentence id="335">You're going to have to go whether you like it or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: They volunteered.</sentence><sentence id="344">You, you, you, you, you get Class A uniform on, and you go.</sentence><sentence id="345">So I was one of those that got tiered to go, and I went to this dance one evening and met my wife and we were attracted to each other; so we started up a letter communication.</sentence><sentence id="346">There was no email back in those days; so the only way we could get together was to write, and so we just worked up a nice relationship.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="351">Q: And you recall the first time you saw her, the first time you laid eyes on her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="361">Q: What did you think when you first saw her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="363">A: Well, I just thought she was nice looking girl that I'd be interested coming back to see her again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="365">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="367">A: So we started writing back and forth, and we'd go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jacksonville</span> and visit with her and met her family, and that was when I--I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Benning</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span> and sort of picked up the writing communication</sentence><sentence id="369">again with her.</sentence><sentence id="370">And I decided it was time that we got more serious.</sentence><sentence id="371">We did, and in--I think it was January 1st of "42, I invited her to come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span>, and I give her an engagement ring, and in the following March we were married there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Wheeler</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: That was a lovely way to start the new year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="382">In a way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Indeed.</sentence><sentence id="386">So let's go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="387">You're in the <span class="REGION">South of England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">You're writing to your wife at that time as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: Oh yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="395">Q: What was it like being away from her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="397">A: Well, of course I missed her, but we were so busy working, training, that I didn't have much time to dwell on the fact that I'm away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I'm lonesome.</sentence><sentence id="398">I was--of course I missed her, but we just had so many activities going on that we didn't have time to get homesick.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="402">Had you had children by that time or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: I'm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="407">Q: Did you have any children at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: So when did--when was it made clear to you that you were going to be sent into combat that you were going into continent, and where did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="415">A: Well, we were on the south coast of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and we could hear the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> of the Air Force going over every night.</sentence><sentence id="416">Bombing somewhere over on the continent and, of course, everything was top secret until the--well, actually it was the Sth of June.</sentence><sentence id="417">At the night of the 5th of June, we heard this tremendous roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going, and that just continued on and on and on.</sentence><sentence id="418">And we're not hearing any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming back; so they were making a wide circle, bombing and then coming back.</sentence><sentence id="419">And it was continuing on all night, and this was unusual because normally they would--the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> would go out and we'd hear them coming back, and that was it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="427">A: So we knew that that was probably the beginning of the invasion, and of course then the next day, we read in the newspapers that the invasion had started and right at that time we were moved to the <span class="REGION">marshalling area</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Hampton</span> in preparation for the crossing.</sentence><sentence id="430">Now on D Day, the Ist and the 29th Division were the assault troops to go across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> and land on <span class="DLF">Omaha Beach</span> and our 30th Division went in behind the 29th five days later.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: I'm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: What was your first experience of combat?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="452">A: Well, it was different than what we expected.</sentence><sentence id="453">When we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, we were all gung ho to go there and tear those guys up and make short of the situation, drive the Germans back and into their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="454">But we had done some training with live ammunition, but it was all very closely guarded so that we would not have any casualties or accidents.</sentence><sentence id="455">Once we got over to Europe, there was no safety regulations, and bullets were flying around fast and furious, and we never knew when the silver bullet was going to hit it us.</sentence><sentence id="456">It was an entirely different situation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="462">Q: Do you remember the first time, the very, very first time that either you received fire or you returned fire?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="464">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="465">It was on the 15th of June.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="469">Where were you?</sentence><sentence id="470">Tell me about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="474">A: We landed on <span class="DLF">Omaha Beach</span>, and I can recall it very well because this was on my birthday, the 13th of June.</sentence><sentence id="475">I'm just talking with my wife here.</sentence><sentence id="476">We landed on my birthday on the 13th of June and moved into what we call a <span class="REGION">bivouac area</span> because this <span class="REGION">area</span> had been cleared out by the 29th Division about two to three miles inland and so we stayed in the <span class="REGION">bivouac area</span> over night, and the next day we marched into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montmarte Grenyas</span> which the 29th Division the day before had taken but were driven back out of it.</sentence><sentence id="477">And so it was our job to then get back into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, clear it out, and continue on from there.</sentence><sentence id="478">And that was our first day of combat, and we were green.</sentence><sentence id="479">We just didn't realize the seriousness of what this whole thing was all about until the silver bullet hit some of our friends, and they encountered <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="480">They were hit by artillery shrapnel.</sentence><sentence id="481">And this was--these guys were being hit, became casualties, and the medics had to take care of them the best they could, and then the next--through the night and the next day we had to get replacements in for those men that were casualties of that day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="496">Q: As a platoon leader, how did that effect you were you--tell me</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: I was responsible for 50 men in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span>, and everything I did, I had to consider the safety of those men to do the actions that we did in firing our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mortars</span>, locating positions that were best suited for us, and to have protection as best we could.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: And did you lose any men on that day or on subsequent days?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: That first day, no.</sentence><sentence id="501">I didn't lose any men, but in subsequent following men, I did lose some men.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: That must have been extraordinarily difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: It was because they were men that I had trained with some back in the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span>, and some in through my period in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and during this period of time, you become close to your men and almost like family.</sentence><sentence id="507">And, you know, it hurts when you see a man get wounded or killed, and you feel a partially responsible for it--although it's not your fault-- you feel that you lost one of your boys, and it hurt.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: You described just now as rather like being a family.</sentence><sentence id="511">As a platoon leader, did you look at the men under your command, were they more like sons to you or more like brothers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: more like sons because, as I mentioned, when I landed there, I was 27 years old on my birthday, and most of my men were 18, 19, 20 years old, what I call kids.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="516">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="518">A: So there was a little bit of a <span class="DLF">gap</span> there, and I felt more or less they were my sons that I had to take care of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="520">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="521">What did you think of--you said before going into combat you had that attitude that.</sentence><sentence id="522">You were going to go in and show these guys the what for.</sentence><sentence id="523">Once you had that experience of close combat, what did you think about the Germans?</sentence><sentence id="524">Were they good soldiers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="530">A: We found that--we really learned that they were well trained, well disciplined soldiers, and they had weapons that were as good as or better than what we had.</sentence><sentence id="531">And the only way we gained the upper hand was the fact that we just had more men.</sentence><sentence id="532">We had more weapons, more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and we just overpowered them by sheer numbers rather than technical better weapons.</sentence><sentence id="533">They had better weapons than we had.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="539">But let's talk about that a little more.</sentence><sentence id="540">How did you view them, the Germans, that is to say the German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="541">How did you view them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="546">A: Well, they were good.</sentence><sentence id="547">The most of them, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wehrmachts</span>, were very good soldiers, well disciplined.</sentence><sentence id="548">One of the big differences that we found is that they went strictly by the</sentence><sentence id="550">book.</sentence><sentence id="551">Whatever was in the training manuals, whatever their leaders told them to do, that's what they did, nothing more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="560">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: But with the American soldiers, we adapted.</sentence><sentence id="563">We were told what to do and how to do it, but if that didn't work, then we had the liberty of doing something else that would work, and we had that flexibility which the Germans did not have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="566">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="567">Now, as you're moving inland, moving deeper and deeper into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, at some point you came into contact with Jews.</sentence><sentence id="568">Can you tell us about that first experience with Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="572">A: Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="574">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="576">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="577">We did not have any contact with Jews.</sentence><sentence id="578">Now, let me go back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="579">Back in the early training days.</sentence><sentence id="580">Occasionally, we would hear or read in the newspapers about some Jews being tortured in Europe, slave laborers, and this periodically would appear, but we never pay much attention to it because what we were hearing was that some Jew would escape from some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span>we didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> back in those days.</sentence><sentence id="581">We heard there were these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they were concentrating Jews and torturing them and using them as slave labor, but the story that we would get was that a Jew escaped from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> went back to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and told the people about what was going on in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span>that the Jews were being tortured and used as slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="582">They wouldn't--they did not believe him.</sentence><sentence id="583">The Jewish congregation in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> did not believe him because, like us, we thought of the German people as being civilized human beings, inelegant people, and they would not do that to another segment of human beings.</sentence><sentence id="584">So this went on, periodically, we would read articles like this while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, but when we got into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, we saw none of that.</sentence><sentence id="585">In fact, Jews didn't even cross our mind.</sentence><sentence id="586">That was not why we were there.</sentence><sentence id="587">We weren't there to liberate to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="588">We didn't know about that whole situation.</sentence><sentence id="589">We were there to drive the Germans out of the <span class="REGION">land</span> which they had occupied illegally.</sentence><sentence id="590">So we were not concerned with Jews, and we never really saw any Jews because the Germans had taken them all out of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to use them as slave laborers.</sentence><sentence id="591">So as we proceeded through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, we did never saw or had any contact with any Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: They were all gone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="612">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="617">A: So we continued on through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in the Battle of the Bulge during the winter of "44 "45, and then we captured the City of Aachen, which was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to fall in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="618">And up to that time, we had seen nor heard nothing about any Jews.</sentence><sentence id="619">Now, we continued up onto northward through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monchengladbach</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hameln</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detmold</span>, and we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> on the 24th of March.</sentence><sentence id="620">Now, up to that time, we had seen nor heard nothing about Jews.</sentence><sentence id="621">That was not in our anything that we cared about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="627">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="628">As you're fighting along and as you're moving through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, what have you, is the German resistance getting stiffer or can- -do you sense has being an officer that it</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="629">A: Oh it was getting much less.</sentence><sentence id="630">From the time--we had our last major battle in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at the City of Mortain, and that was the beginning of what we called the rat race, that they were moving back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> almost as fast as they could.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="631">Q: So as an officer, you could sense them in retreat?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="633">A: I'm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="635">Q: You could sense them in retreat?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="637">A: Well, yes.</sentence><sentence id="638">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="641">Q: So you crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="642">Let's go to that period of time, and you're pressing on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="645">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="646">So we were just chasing them.</sentence><sentence id="647">They were doing what we call--I forgot what it is now--sort of defensive action as they were retreating, and the major part of the German army was moving back eastward toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they would leave a small segment of men behind to delay us, to create delaying actions.</sentence><sentence id="648">And that's all we did all the way across <span class="REGION">northern France</span> and up into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and not until we got into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the <span class="DLF">German border</span> where they had the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="649">That's where we had to stop and of course they stopped as well, but the reason that we stopped there was that we had run across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> so fast, we had outrun our <span class="DLF">supply lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">Now, all of our supplies had to come across <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span>, and by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, move them up daily to supply us with food, ammunition, clothing, replacements.</sentence><sentence id="651">So it was kind of a slow process, and we were moving faster than the <span class="DLF">supply lines</span> could keep up with us.</sentence><sentence id="652">So by the time we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span>, we had left thousands of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> behind because we ran out of gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="653">We just dropped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> off at the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and abandoned them more or less.</sentence><sentence id="654">So by the time we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, we were out of food, we were out of ammunition, we were out of gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="655">So we had to stop there nearly a month waiting for supplies to reach us and become resupplied with ammunition, with food, replacement men before we could</sentence><sentence id="657">make a successful attack on the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span>, and once we got the momentum going, to keep on going.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="672">Q: When did that happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="674">A: That was in about February of "44 or "45.</sentence><sentence id="675">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="676">February "45 that we crashed through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> and we had enough momentum going that we just kept on going, and got up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monchengladbach</span> and Wessel and across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span>, which was the biggest major obstacle that we had at that time.</sentence><sentence id="677">So we continued on from crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> 24th of March and headed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span>, which is in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">Now, up to this time, we had not seen nor heard anything about Jews or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">Nothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="686">Q: Now, this should have been around April, was it not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="688">A: This was the 10th of April that we captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span>.</sentence><sentence id="689">Now, there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp BergenBelsen</span> which was a little bit north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span>, because that was in the <span class="REGION">British zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="690">So we had nothing to do with it, but it was there nevertheless.</sentence><sentence id="691">But we didn't even hear about it.</sentence><sentence id="692">We captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span>, and then our next objective was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="693">It was probably 75 or 100 miles further east, and we started moving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> on toward <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, and we came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> where there was a large <span class="BUILDING">German air base</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">We captured that, and then there was a number of large <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and we thought nothing of it.</sentence><sentence id="695">We just captured that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and went onto the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">As we were approaching this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span>--this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is probably a thousand people at the most.</sentence><sentence id="697">We met some soldiers who were walking along the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> westward, and they said that up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span>, the Germans are preparing an attack, an ambush, for you.</sentence><sentence id="698">And they are protecting a trainload of people.</sentence><sentence id="699">We didn't understand exactly what they meant by "a trainload of people."</sentence><sentence id="700">So we had our reconnaissance unit, which was a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and infantry men on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> to move forward to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span>.</sentence><sentence id="701">They found no resistance in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="702">They cleared it out, and on the east side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, there was a little <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were still moving forward, and as they mounted the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and looked down into the little valley on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, they saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sitting there with a bunch of people milling around doing whatever they wanted to do really.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="718">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="719">This should have been--just to clarify where we are in time, that should of been probably the 12th or 13th of April.</sentence><sentence id="720">Somewhere around there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="724">A: This was the 13th of April.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="726">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="728">A: That was when we liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brunswick</span> on the 10th, and I think we liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> on the 11th or 12th, and this was the next day, the 13th of April, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="729">We</sentence><sentence id="731">saw this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and not knowing exactly what it was, very cautiously we approached it.</sentence><sentence id="732">They in turn--they saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and recognized them as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">And they came rushing forward to meet and greet us.</sentence><sentence id="734">Then, we found--through a few of these people who could speak a little bit of English, and one of our guys was a Jew, and he could speak a little bit of Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="735">Well, they began to communicate, and what they found was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had about 2,500 people on it.</sentence><sentence id="736">And it had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">Well, what is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span>?</sentence><sentence id="738">We never heard of it.</sentence><sentence id="739">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="740">They told BergenBelsen was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where they had about 50,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="741">This was the first time, the very first time, that we had ever heard of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="742">This was the first time we had met any Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: That they were brought in there and administered help to them, and this was where I got assigned a job of moving these people away from this point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span> because actually this was still a battle zone, and we had American artillery falling in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="896">We had German artillery falling in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="897">So we didn't want to have anymore casualties.</sentence><sentence id="898">So I was delegated then to round up transportation and take these people out of there to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span> that we had liberated a couple of days before where there was a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="899">So I rounded up about 60 or 70 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and got them loaded up and got them out of the <span class="REGION">area</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span>.</sentence><sentence id="900">And of course, the medical corps went with them, and they put the sick people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and the others went into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, but first of all, as soon as we brought them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillersleben</span>, they were so dirty and stinking and filthy that there was nothing that we could do to give them clean clothing, so we had to have them strip their clothing off, and the engineer battalion set up some shower points, and we started moving them through the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>--the first <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> that they had had in months and years.</sentence><sentence id="901">And as soon as they got through the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, of course, they were given towels and soap, and they were so happy to get cleaned up to little bit, but even through the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, they could not get rid of the lice that were infested in their hair and in their pubic hairs.</sentence><sentence id="902">And so after they finished the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, we dusted them with DDT.</sentence><sentence id="903">Now, DDT is today a prohibited item because it's a carcinoginious[sic] item and is, by law, is prohibited for use.</sentence><sentence id="904">But at that time that was the best technology that we had to fight lice and fleas any kind of insect that they might have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="915">Q: Did it work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="917">A: It worked.</sentence><sentence id="918">So then we had the German people were ordered to bring clothing to this point and of course they were reclothed, and then the single people were put in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="919">The married people were put in to some of the private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that were available.</sentence><sentence id="920">And at this point, I left them.</sentence><sentence id="921">They went back to my unit and continued on my job, and we fought or way onto <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> and we attacked, captured <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> on the 18th of April, and as far as we were concerned, that was the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="922">Because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elm River</span> which ran through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> was the <span class="DLF">demarcation line</span> between us and the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="923">We could not go beyond that <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="924">So we stopped fighting on the 18th of April, and just sat there and wait for the Russians to come in front of us and move on into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="925">But basically that was the end of the war, and that was the first and only contact that we had ever had with any Jews, this group of the 2,500 on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="928">And of course, in talking with some of them, we found out where they came from, and that they had been incarcerated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span>, and they told us a story about their life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BergenBelsen</span> and them being put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and then we captured them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1202">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1203">I never gave it much thought until--I guess in the 80s, we were cleaning out some junk in somewhere, holdings, and

that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and I just stopped to think about those days and those people, and I thought that that would be a good historical document.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And so I took all the notes that I had in those notebooks and kind of put them together in a handwritten document this was before the days of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> really, and--but a little later, when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span>--when the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> got involved with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span>, I started transferring all that stuff into my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1206">Well, I had this document there and still did nothing with it, just a document for

moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> and they purged everything that was in the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> and <span

long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, but friend of hers had a book which said something about the Americans had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741"

of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> on the 16th of the April, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1222">She put this all together and wrote up her thesis, and she did get her Ph.D. but she took that document to the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, and he was rather surprised to know that the Americans actually had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1223">He was always of the impression that the Russians had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1224">Now, we're coming up on April of 2005, which then was going to be the--I think the 40th

long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1225">So they were planing to have a big celebration on the anniversary of the founding of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741"

unknown to me at the time, they invited a man who had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1227">Now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, there was a pulte ammunition works which was making ammunition for the German war machine, and this was operated by slave laborers, Jewish slave laborers, which had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1228">And we, the 30th Division, had actually liberated this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span>, and that was in a matter of a few days after we had liberated the Farsleben group.</sentence><sentence id="1229">Anyway, the mayor, through another person, invited this man who--this Jew who had been a slave laborer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> in the pulte ammunition works to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> to tell the people about his incarceration.</sentence><sentence id="1230">At the same time he invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> to tell the people about the actual liberation by the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1231">So for the first time, when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, I met this man, the man who--the Jew that I had liberated in 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1232">So we worked up a nice relationship, and I found that he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boca Raton</span>, <span class="REGION">Florida</span>, about three hours away from where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="1233">So this was a fascinating thing that I, a

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1252">Q: And have you been in communication with him since?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1254">A: I was.</sentence><sentence id="1255">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="1256">He just died about a month ago.</sentence><sentence id="1257">Anyway, after we came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, he sent me an email saying, "Frank, look at this <span class="BUILDING">web site</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1258">It is tremendous."</sentence><sentence id="1259">And I opened up the web site, and it was a web site created by a history teacher up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hudson Falls</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and it was about a tank commander of the 743rd Tank Battalion having liberated a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1260">Well, I read the whole story through, and it was exactly the story that I related to you.</sentence><sentence id="1261">And how did this guy get this story?</sentence><sentence id="1262">So I got in contact with this teacher to find out what his relationship was to this <span class="BUILDING">web site</span> and story.</sentence><sentence id="1263">And it seems that he was a World War II history buff, but he was at the time concentrating on the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1264">And he gave his class a project to go out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and see if you can contact a veteran who had anything to do with his connection with the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1265">The students brought their stories in, and read them.</sentence><sentence id="1266">They discussed them, but there was one boy who had a very unique story--that his grandfather was a tank commander in the 743rd Tank Battalion, and they had captured this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with 2,500 Jews on it.</sentence><sentence id="1267">Well, that's exactly my story.</sentence><sentence id="1268">So I got together with this teacher and we discussed</sentence><sentence id="1270">his side of it, and I told him my connection with it.</sentence><sentence id="1271">And so we've been sort of collaborating together ever since.</sentence><sentence id="1272">Now, at the time, he put his web site out he got in--his story went out on the Internet, and the first hit that he had on it was from a lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1273">Now, she was a young girl on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and her family moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> at that time, and of course she's been there ever since, and she saw that web site, and she got back in contact with the teacher, and through that--and then he had two or three other hits up in New York.</sentence><sentence id="1274">So when I was discussing this matter with him, he had probably about 10 or 12 Jews that he had had contact with who were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1275">Well, I said, you know, I've got this story about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and want to get involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="1276">So I went on the Internet and put my story out, and I started getting hits on it.</sentence><sentence id="1277">And it just snowballed, and eventually I got in contact with a person in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who had been a young boy.</sentence><sentence id="1278">He had been <span class="BUILDING">orphaned</span>, and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>--or went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and was adopted by a family, was educated there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, and he became a doctor, a medical doctor and had practiced and just retired when I first got in contact with him.</sentence><sentence id="1279">He could not speak very good English, and it was very difficult for me to understand him, but his daughter was quite interested, and she could speak much better English than he could; although it was kind of broken up.</sentence><sentence id="1280">So she became very interested in his story because, as with many of these Jews, as they grew up, they wanted to forget the past.</sentence><sentence id="1281">They wanted to forget about the Holocaust and not even talk about it to their families.</sentence><sentence id="1282">So she was interested in it, and she wanted to hear more about it, wanted to learn what her father had been through.</sentence><sentence id="1283">So I gave her the whole story as I could recall, and she became very much involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="1284">And her father originally was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, he was Hungarian, and he remembered the names of some of the people, and she started researching there in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for some of those people, and she found a number of them.</sentence><sentence id="1285">So this increased our numbers of people who had survived this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1286">Now, going back just a bit on this--on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> originally, there was about 2,500 people, and of them, there were about 600 children.</sentence><sentence id="1287">Now, I say children.</sentence><sentence id="1288">These are people 21 years of age and less.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1326">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1328">A: Now, the Germans were quite meticulous about keeping records.</sentence><sentence id="1329">When that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left BergenBelsen, and we captured it there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farsleben</span>, the train commander had a list of all the people that were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1330">That list contained their name, their birth date, and their birthplace, and of course other data too that was not really relevant.</sentence><sentence id="1331">That document was taken and retained by what is now the BergenBelsen Memorial, and I got a copy of that list and went through it and since it had the birth date of everybody that was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I could determine who the children were.</sentence><sentence id="1332">So I sorted out all the children in the 600 names, and of those--I just assumed half of them were deceased because of malnutrition, age, and other causes.</sentence><sentence id="1333">So we're down to about the possibility of 300plus surviving children out there somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1334">So with this young lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> doing some research and finding some of these people and some of my research through the Internet, I have found</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1338">235 of these people, and I've been in contact with each one either by mail physical (phone interference)</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1339">Q: Can you say that last <span class="NPIP">part</span> again?</sentence><sentence id="1340">We had a trifle bit of audio difficulty, I lost you at you were contacting them by email.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1341">A: Either by email or snail mail.</sentence></p></dialogue>
