F-E-I-G-E-L would have been a more Jewish name but G-L was a typical Austrian name, almost as common if you will, as Smith in the States.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Can you tell me how it was then that you all came to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>?</sentence><sentence id="230">Do you remember very much of that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Yes, about "36, mid-"36, my father was told to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and close down the <span class="BUILDING">branch office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">Apparently, this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> didn't do very well.</sentence><sentence id="233">It was not profitable.</sentence><sentence id="234">So, the entire family moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and the move was totally unrelated to what was going on politically in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for a year.</sentence><sentence id="235">I certainly found myself thrown into a Czech-speaking environment which I apparently picked up within six months, I was speaking Czech in 1936.</sentence><sentence id="236">I was seven years old and we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for one year and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">When I say back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to my father's birth place and where what I thought was the headquarters of the company and established residence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and it must have been in early 1937.</sentence><sentence id="238">At that point, the problem of Jewish persecution and so forth must have concerned my father because at that time he decided to have me baptized Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="239">Over 95-percent of the Austrian population is Catholic and he thought that as an Austrian being a Catholic certainly couldn't do me any harm and so at the age of nine, I'm sorry, eight and a half, I was baptized by a Cardinal Innitzer.</sentence><sentence id="240">He had arranged to have the Cardinal baptize me and I went into <span class="BUILDING">catechism school</span> and basically thought of myself as Catholic at this point.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Were you in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Yes, I was in a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I guess about one year until the Anschluss came in March of 1938 when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and at that point my father actually on the day of the Anschluss was outside the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> on one of his many business trips and my mother was hoping that he would remain abroad so that he could send for us but after struggling for three days, my father managed to appear back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> triumphantly that he had managed to smuggle himself back into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> on a cold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span>, inside a cold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span>, coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he was all covered with soot and looked like a chimney sweep and there he was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Do you remember him...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: I remember it because it was a big fight between my mother and my father at that time.</sentence><sentence id="270">My mother was furious that he had returned.</sentence><sentence id="271">She thought he was an idiot for not having stayed abroad and just calling for us to join him and he on the other hand was trying to defend his actions that he couldn't just leave us and abandon us and there was no guarantee that he could get us out and that's what he gets for struggling and risking his life to come back to get us.</sentence><sentence id="272">It was a big argument.</sentence><sentence id="273">I also remember that on the day of the Anschluss in 1938, so I had just turned nine years old, I left that morning and we lived in the vicinity of the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Rathaus</span> and I went down there and I saw these tens of thousands of people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and all the German flags and the music and the band and everything else and I was in there with the mass of the people shouting my head off like everybody else, "Ein volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer", one people, one Reich and one leader and I actually saw Hitler on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> up there on the <span class="BUILDING">Rathaus</span> and when I finally got <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my mother was beside herself, she didn't know, "Where have you been?You've been gone for six hours you know?"</sentence><sentence id="274">And I said, "I saw our Fuhrer."</sentence><sentence id="275">Where upon my mother slapped me left and right and said, "Never call that SOB again "Our Fuhrer".</sentence><sentence id="276">He is not "Our Fuhrer"."</sentence><sentence id="277">And I guess that's the first time that I came to the realization, wait a minute, some how I don't fit in, we don't fit into the grandiose schemes of this maniac but as I said, at nine I really, I wanted to have a uniform like all the other kids who were going, who were joining the Hitler Jugend.</sentence><sentence id="278">You know, and have a little dagger and sand brown belt and march to the music and the drums and all this is fascinating and hypnotizing for a young kid.</sentence><sentence id="279">But shortly after that I think within a matter of two weeks, my father managed to get himself transferred to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and we immigrated hurriedly and left most of our property in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Do you remember were there other relatives, what they were thinking at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="295">Were there discussions among the family?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I was a child and in those days children were told you're here to be seen, not to be heard and I really . . .</sentence><sentence id="297">I cannot recollect any discussions about the dangers and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="298">I don't think that this is something that dawned on me until we left very hurriedly from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">I believe that my father at some time, some where got the German authorities mad at him because he refused to cooperate on importing some materials which they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="300">| think it was aircraft engines to which he had access and I believe that they were trying to get him to import aircraft engines either into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> or into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then transship from there as agricultural machinery into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">I know the Versailles Treaty that ended World War I, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was prohibited from importing any war materials and so forth and he felt at the time that as an Austrian, they couldn't harm him and he more or less told them to go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and he then realized that now that the Germans are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, I'm probably on their black list and they'll want to get even which I think was the primary motivating force behind his leaving hurriedly and getting out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: What about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during that Spring of that year?</sentence><sentence id="309">Did the teachers talk about, do you remember any mood or change?</sentence><sentence id="310">Was it obvious to you as a child that something was happening or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="488">A: Well, as I mentioned I think my father quickly came to the realization that either the illusion that he had created for himself that as an Austrian, the problem of the Jews was not his it was a German problem and now he suddenly found that there are no more Austrians and he was a German Jew at this point and certainly by the definition of the Nazis, which made it a racial definition rather than a question of credence and belief, and then also I think I remember discussions between my mother and my father about, you shouldn't have done that when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and I think that that related to the fact that he more or less rejected some of the inducements or enticements that the Nazis had offered and I think my mother felt that this is going to haunt you some day and now is the time, they are here to haunt you.</sentence><sentence id="489">They are going to come and get you and I believe my father, because of that, managed to get a transfer to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and to get his assignment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and he left first and we followed a few weeks later.</sentence><sentence id="490">We followed and we settled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> at that time and he would commute daily from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">I think that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> at that time had a very high speed mass transit system and you could move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> in less than an hour and so every morning he would go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and commute to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="513">But I don't know how exactly or when, she obviously went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> directly 2 to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> rather than through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and it's only speculation on my part, possibly she may have been asked by my mother to come and join them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: Well I'm sure your mother was quite frightened for whatever reason that she may not be able to imagine, she couldn't get back to him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: Yes, there was that, although perhaps a word about my mother here.</sentence><sentence id="541">Between my 3 father and my mother, my mother was by

prefecture.</sentence><sentence id="548">So she goes to the prefecture and goes through the same routine and they send her back to somewhere else and after about four or five times of being sent from one to the other, someone finally said to her, ah Madame, we know exactly how to deal with cases such as yours, there is a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, it's called Olorons St. Marie, it's in the

French Gendarmes with machine guns and they take us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the next stop was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French concentration camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp De Gurs</span> and we found ourselves in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="552"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span> was a camp in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees mountains</span> which had been built in the 1930s by the French to house the fleeing Spanish, mostly community people that fled the Spanish revolutionary war and suddenly this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had been

from the Spaniards that were still there were now Jewish refugees getting German Jews, French Jews, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, Belgian Jews, Dutch Jews, whoever was able to flee was in that camp.</sentence><sentence id="555">My mother, this is 1940s, so she is about 36 or 38 years old, she was in her prime and as I said she was physically very fit, she was immediately picked to become a barracks chief.</sentence><sentence id="556">So as <span class="BUILDING">barracks chief</span> she had a lot of freedom within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that is to move from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or to move from one I Lot, as they call them, or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was sort of divided into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> and she was responsible for going every day to pick up the food that was allotted to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="557">So, she knew what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">She was well informed about

for I guess it was about almost six weeks or so, close to six weeks and my mother had a run-in with some nuns that were put in charge of the food supply and as <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> chief my mother tried to beg, plead, borrow anything to try to get an extra ration of bread or an extra can of sardines or an extra something in each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">I think each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> held about sixty to seventy people that she had to feed and one of the nuns lectured her and said, Madame, you do not live to eat, you eat to live.</sentence><sentence id="568">Whereupon my mother hauled out and slapped her.</sentence><sentence id="569">It did get her an extra supply of rations.</sentence><sentence id="570">Anyhow, after about six weeks or so, when the French were about to surrender in late June of 1940, my mother learned that there was a Wehrmacht, a German army

looked at me and my mother had her mother's passport and opened it up and with her passport on top of it, she was hiding the "J", and the German officer was so taken back, he just turned to the French

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="629">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="630">I was standing by her.</sentence><sentence id="631">She had taken me along and obviously she was all packed and ready to go, she figured it's either going to work or it won't.</sentence><sentence id="632">We drove for several hours and came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span>, A-U-C-H, which was a little bit in the area <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span>, in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and as we approached the <span class="DLF">city limits</span> and the <span class="DLF">town limits</span>, we were crossing <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span>, and all of a sudden a group of people came toward us and waved at us, and said, "Stop, stop, don't go any further, the Germans are on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>."</sentence><sentence id="633">So, my mother looked around and she saw that there was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> off there to the left side of the tracks and so she took our bags and me and my grandmother and dismissed the cab driver and we walked across the open <span class="DLF">field</span> over to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and she knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the nuns 5 took us in and for the next six weeks we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="634">Whether the fact that I was Catholic had something to do with it, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="635">I don't know whether my mother played that card or not.</sentence><sentence id="636">I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="637">But the nuns did take us in and during the five or six weeks that we spent in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, the nuns made contact with various, or they were in contact with various refugee assistance aid organizations and among them a group of American Quakers who had a food distribution and <span class="BUILDING">refugee assistance office</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="638">So my mother was offered a job with the Quakers to help in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="639">It was a part-time job but it enabled her to leave the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and find a one-room apartment and moved into it.</sentence><sentence id="640">My mother also earned extra money becoming a cleaning lady and now at this point I don't remember what happened to my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="641">She somehow left at this point.</sentence><sentence id="642">I don't know what but she left us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="659">A: I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="660">I think that she must have somehow managed to contact her daughter, the other daughter, the younger one who had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and somehow, at some point, she managed to rejoin her and managed to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="661">Now, I think it had something to do with the fact my aunt's husband, the one she married in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, his name was Joel Bloomberg (ph), he was called Jole Bloomberg (ph).</sentence><sentence id="662">He was very active in Zionist activities and so forth and he was, I think a Latvian or Lithuanian nationality so he had a passport from one of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and at that time those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were not yet involved in the war so he was, if you will, a citizen of a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, my aunt had acquired his nationality when she married him and I think that that helped them to obtain the necessary visas and he had been traveling back and forth on Zionist movement activities to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and to many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> throughout Europe.</sentence><sentence id="663">I think he was a lecturer also and lectured in many <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="664">So he had a great deal of mobility, if you will, and I think that's how somehow they managed to get her, my grandmother, to join them and to ultimately come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="665">I think they made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> about 1941 or so before Pearl Harbor, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="666">I know they spent a great deal of time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> waiting for both first their visa and then their passage.</sentence><sentence id="667">There was limited <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> available on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="791">A: No, that's a good question.</sentence><sentence id="792">Their reason for going on, for living was only one thing and that is to get out of <span

and my uncle were already in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> waiting to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">My parents wanted to do the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="795">My father had approached his business contacts in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Champion Spark

id="799">and it was very disturbing for them.</sentence><sentence id="800">I still have many of the letters that they wrote to my grandmother after she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which my grandmother left to me when she died and it's a very sad story listening to what my parents had to say at the time.</sentence><sentence id="801">There were utter frustrations for them, they found themselves in a chicken and egg situation.</sentence><sentence id="802">Yes, we will give you a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, if you have a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>, yes <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> said we will give you a visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> provided you have a visa to go on to the <span

we will not book passes on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> unless you first have a visa to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="805">I mean it was, they were just constantly running up against this kind of a problem or you must come up with so many hundred of dollars which today would be equal to in the tens of thousands of dollars to ensure that you have a priority on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> or to ensure that you get a visa or you get a passage or what have you and they didn't have that money.</sentence><sentence id="806">We lived pretty close to the poverty level in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> so it was hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="807">He kept writing to, my father and my mother both kept writing to

and so.</sentence><sentence id="815">Talk to Mr. so and so and it was just all in vain, nothing but frustration.</sentence><sentence id="816">So, those were very very difficult days for them again, they did everything in their power to shield me from this such as sending me off to these <span class="REGION">children's colonies</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> and so forth and this brings us basically to the 1942 period and it was in 1942 that the Germans in cooperation with the French Vichy government decided on their policy to round up the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">The French thought that well, if we're going to round up Jews, let's first try and round up the foreign Jews.</sentence><sentence id="818">That way maybe we can protect the French Jews.</sentence><sentence id="819">The French Prime Minister, Laval, when the Germans asked that they 9 round up the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, he only asked for the adults and Laval said, please take the children too.</sentence><sentence id="820">You want to keep the families together, don't you?</sentence><sentence id="821">And the Germans said, no, we don't want the children and Laval insisted until finally they said, well alright we'll take the kids too but there was basically something that Laval, Frenchman, was pushing for and at this point, July, let's see, end of June, early July, just before I left for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children's colony</span>, school vacation starts on the fourteenth of July generally in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="822">So, I know I remember that there were a lot of whispered discussions going on in our one-room apartment.</sentence><sentence id="823">There was a lot of worry.</sentence><sentence id="824">I would pick up words about raffles, razzigs, they're rounding up people.</sentence><sentence id="825">People are being shipped off, nobody knows where.</sentence><sentence id="826">So, I was somewhat aware of something was brewing and that there was danger here but then came vacation time and I was sent off and I was with other kids and forgot all about this.</sentence><sentence id="827">Sometime in early August, my father came to visit me at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> and he made a very long trip on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, thirty miles.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="867">A: No, it's okay.</sentence><sentence id="868">For a man who was sick and he came to visit me and I remember on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> he had square cookie box and out of the cookie box he produced a small bag that my mother had sewn and it contained my father's pocket watch and he had a black fob with a gold Buddha attached to it and his silver pencil which he was very proud of, he had gotten it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="869">It was sort of a four color mechanical pencil and a ring from my mother, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">broach</span>, a few other items, a small amount of money and he gave it to me and told me to look after it and at first it didn't register with me.</sentence><sentence id="870">Why are they doing this?</sentence><sentence id="871">Why is he doing this?</sentence><sentence id="872">And after he spent a couple of hours with me, he climbed back on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and headed back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> and as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> disappeared over the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, the crest of the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, I broke out crying and somehow I had the feeling I would never see him again.</sentence><sentence id="873">It was a few days later, maybe ten days, four days later or so that the director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a very kind woman, Mrs. Cavaillon, she called me to her <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and she announced to me that she had bad news, she had been informed that my parents had been arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> the day before and they didn't know where they were taken.</sentence><sentence id="874">There was no information and I was obviously very upset and she was a very devoted, very religious woman, a Catholic woman, and I had been going to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> almost daily.</sentence><sentence id="875">She encouraged everyone to go to <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> everyday and this was not a camp for Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="876">I think I was probably the only Jewish child there.</sentence><sentence id="877">These were all French children from I would say middle or lower middle class families who found a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="878">She also told me that they were going to hold a novena, nine days of prayer and after nine days, my parents would be returned to me and there was nothing to worry about.</sentence><sentence id="879">A day or two later I was again called by her and I was told that they are going to have to make me sick because she had a phone call from the police, from the 0 gendarme and they alerted her and told her that they had received orders from Auch to come and pick me up but if they come and they find me ill, so ill that I cannot be transported, then they will leave me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: That's what they told her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="896">They told her that.</sentence><sentence id="897">So, they induced a fever in me and I'm always asked, how do you do that and they took some French bread and made balls out of it, like meatballs and soaked them in vinegar and I had to swallow about eight or nine of these vinegar soaked bread balls and sure enough within a half an hour or forty-five minutes, I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a high fever and when the police came, they took my temperature and they verified and certified that yes, he is not fit to be transported.</sentence><sentence id="898">So, that saved me that night or that day.</sentence><sentence id="899">The gendarme came back on two or three other occasions and each time the same thing was played.</sentence><sentence id="900">The same act was laid out.</sentence><sentence id="901">During that time period...</sentence></p></dialogue>

kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="1097">I mean, it was a long hike, up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> too, up the <span class="DLF">hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1098">So, I now find myself in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> together with about 15 or so kids in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">Daniel Trocme" was our shepherd who looked after us.</sentence><sentence id="1100">He was a younger man, he was probably in his twenties, mid- to late twenties.</sentence><sentence id="1101">He looked after us and the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> really is the full detail, as I didn't become aware of until a few years ago, of ten to fifteen years ago, but the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> apparently was a conspiracy to protect people and the people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> are about 90-percent Protestants, fundamentalist and people who, as they put it, lived the Bible, lived by the Bible and their pastor gave them the needed inspiration on the day that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell and surrendered to the Germans by telling his congregation that it is the responsibility of every Christian to resist the occupier with the weapons of the spirit and that's where 5 subsequently the title of a film about Le Chambon came from, Weapons of the Spirit.</sentence><sentence id="1102">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> has a total population of about five thousand people during the period of about three years, actually hid and saved five thousand people, almost on a one-on- one basis.</sentence><sentence id="1103">These villagers never asked who you were or whether you were Jewish or not or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1104">They took you in.</sentence><sentence id="1105">They fed you.</sentence><sentence id="1106">You never had a situation of people saying, well, I wish I could help you but we don't have an empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or no, they opened up their <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they shared what little they had.</sentence><sentence id="1107">I always liked to, when I tell about <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> to Americans, I try to make them understand that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">European farm villages</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farming community</span> is quite different from the American one in that the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> live clustered, very close together, one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to the other, there's no big <span class="DLF">yard</span>, no acreage between them.</sentence><sentence id="1108">The people look across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, a narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> usually, and if they see the lights going out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, they know perfectly well it is ten past nine and they know that they count in twenty seconds a light will go on on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> on the third <span class="DLF">window</span> from the right and that's the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and the light will be on for three minutes and thirty seconds and then the light will go out so you know exactly what your neighbor is doing.</sentence><sentence id="1109">You know his routine.</sentence><sentence id="1110">You can't escape it.</sentence><sentence id="1111">During that period, lights went on and <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where lights were never on at night and lights stayed on in <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> way past the normal times and nobody ever reported this to the police, nobody ever betrayed anybody and that's truly remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="1112">And you must understand that the people did this, this did so knowing fully well that if the police were to find out, they wouldn't just arrest the person that they were hiding but they were subject to arrest as well as the entire family and their children.</sentence><sentence id="1113">Confiscation of their property, of their goods and deportation to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1114">So, what these people did, they did it at the risk of their own lives.</sentence><sentence id="1115">So, I was hidden there for about ten months.</sentence><sentence id="1116">During that period, they also saw to it that our education was not completely neglected.</sentence><sentence id="1117">There was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Le College Cevenol</span>, which had been created as a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> before the war and they saw to it that we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day and that we get on with our education.</sentence><sentence id="1118">It usually meant long hikes from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived down to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and on the way back, we usually came back up with supplies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1119">It was difficult to get shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1120">For example, Daniel Trocme" would scrounge worn out old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tires</span> and he would cut up the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tires</span> and make soles for sandals out of them and by putting holes into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tires</span> and stringing rope through them, he would make sandals out of them.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Something that is very fashionable these days, I see a lot of kids walking around with these black sandals.</sentence><sentence id="1122">It was a rugged <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1123">It was at about an elevation of about three thousand feet.</sentence><sentence id="1124">The winters were very very cold.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Lots of snow.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Most of us had frostbite on the hands, on the fingers and on our toes.</sentence><sentence id="1127">Partly because our clothing wasn't really that adequate but it also had a lot to do with the fact that our food was inadequate.</sentence><sentence id="1128">There wasn't enough fat content in the food and most of us were deficient in a number of nutrients and so forth but just about everybody was frostbitten fingers or toes.</sentence><sentence id="1129">Durith that 6 period, there was an organization there, individuals who specialized in forging papers and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1167">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1168">Some of the local citizens, some of them were part of the group of refugees.</sentence><sentence id="1169">In other words, either the people that they took in were not just children, they were also adults, some husbands and wives, there was even a German deserter from the German army that they had taken in.</sentence><sentence id="1170">I had befriended him because he spoke German fluently so we would speak German together.</sentence><sentence id="1171">He was a, I remember as very tall, pale looking, very soft-spoken, gentle type guy who must have been eighteen or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1172">He deserted them.</sentence><sentence id="1173">He decided to <span class="DLF">desert</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1174">Anyhow, in order to make room for other people in need, there was a full underground railroad, if you will, operating and if they could pass somebody as a Frenchman, and send them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to some other safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>, safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, if you will, then they would do so because then they would have more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to take on more new people that might be in need and since I spoke French fluently without the trace of an accent, ultimately I was given some French identity papers, false name, forged ration tickets, coupons that you had to have at the time and so forth and I was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> in the lot department as a boarding student, it was <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> students in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> during that time were quite numerous and common almost in every <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> because you couldn't commute, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">school buses</span> so anyone who lived let's say five miles or more away from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the parents would just have the child boarded in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at least for the week, if not for the entire semester.</sentence><sentence id="1175">So, I lived as a boarding student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1185">Q: Before we leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, I would like for you to talk about that ten months that you were there, what was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but what was your daily life like, with the other people, who were the other young people that were with you, what were you aware of in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, did you have a sense of town mood, people were there from other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, or did you just think it was your group of people, tell me about what it was like to live there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1187">A: They tried to keep us busy first of all.</sentence><sentence id="1188">Now during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> months, between walking to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, coming back with supplies, doing your homework, by the time you were finished, it was time to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and get ready for the next day.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Our stay occasionally would be interrupted, our activities would be interrupted by suddenly someone saying, ah, we're going to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for a hike and at the time, I didn't know the reason why and this is something that I found out later on, periodically the police would tip off people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, and tell them we're coming up there at 10 o'clock to round up or look for Jews or look for people that are 7 hidden up in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, get them out.</sentence><sentence id="1190">So, they didn't tell us the reason, they just told us, we're going to go and pick mushrooms in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or if it wasn't mushrooms season or we're going to go for a nature hike, a little walk and sometimes we would stay in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for six hours, eight hours or something like that and then we would come back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and everything was fine and dandy.</sentence><sentence id="1191">We didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1192">During the summer months, there was a lot of hiking, a lot of tug of wars and games that were organized, occasionally, we would be visited by Pastor Trocme", Daniel's relative.</sentence><sentence id="1193">The Pastor was the inspiration and leader of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the groups in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which I was, was a very mixed group, there were boys and there were girls.</sentence><sentence id="1194">Among them were some Spanish refugees still, children of Spanish parents, of Spanish origin whose parents obviously had fled Franco, <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> during or after the revolution and found themselves in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and were either orphans or were persecuted for one reason or other.</sentence><sentence id="1195">There were some people from <span

Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1198">He may have been an <span class="BUILDING">orphan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1199">I think he was an <span

very close friends.</sentence><sentence id="1203">So, it was a mix of people.</sentence><sentence id="1204">There was an Italian woman who was the cook, who cooked for us and she had a daughter there also.</sentence><sentence id="1205">Her daughter was there.</sentence><sentence id="1206">I really don't know why they were there, what the reason was.</sentence><sentence id="1207">But, as I said, it was a very mixed group of nationalities.</sentence><sentence id="1208">I collected a lot of photographs which I kept and practically all of these photographs were passport-type pictures that were taken by the people who were creating these false documents, these forged documents for us.</sentence><sentence id="1209">But, they gave us an extra supply of pictures and when we learned that we might have to leave, we would start exchanging photographs and give a souvenir to our best friend by dedicating the photograph to him or her and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1210">I was able to take a lot of these photographs with me which I shouldn't have but we'll talk about that later maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1211">But day flowed into day, occasionally I would inquire whether anything had been heard from my parents and by now, I think I came to the realization that there was a program afoot in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so forth to deport Jews, deport them to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or east to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1212">The name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I hadn't heard of it yet and so as time went on, let's say that my hopes faded too and I just kept on.</sentence><sentence id="1213">I was of course cut off from any other relatives at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1214">I had no idea whether my grandmother, uncle and aunt had made it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and if they did, I wouldn't know where or how to contact them.</sentence><sentence id="1215">I had some relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1216">I had mentioned Kleczewer

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1308">A: I met Andre Trocme"", well first of all Andre Trocme" came and visited at <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span> on several occasions.</sentence><sentence id="1309">At that time, again, I certainly was not aware of what a splendid individual this man was and he was just one of the older people who were looking after us.</sentence><sentence id="1310">I met Mrs. Trocme" about ten years ago or so after the war when I went to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> and so she appears in that movie I mentioned, Weapons of the Spirit, and so, but the Trocme" family is remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="1311">Daniel Trocme" by the way is one of the very very few people that was arrested by the Germans and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and killed because the Germans simply could not believe that an Arian, a non-Jew would do what Daniel had done and so he is one of the very few people that was arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and died.</sentence><sentence id="1312">Andre Trocme" was also arrested together with the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, someone named Theis and they were locked up for thirty days until for some reason the Germans released them after thirty days.</sentence><sentence id="1313">They came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and continued their good deeds, their good work.</sentence><sentence id="1314">It's a fascinating . . .</sentence><sentence id="1315">that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is truly a fascinating story.</sentence><sentence id="1316">I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the French Protestants of course, had been severely persecuted back in the 15th century and these were descendants of the original French Protestants, the Huguenots they are called.</sentence><sentence id="1317">Many Huguenots fled to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to what later became the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1318">But the French, basically the French Catholics were out to exterminate them and the ancestors of the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> managed to clamber up on this mountainous plateau and it was the beginning of the winter and the pursuing French soldiers probably said, well let him croak up there.</sentence><sentence id="1319">Nobody can live up there anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1320">But they survived and in their <span class="BUILDING">church services</span> and in their, what do they call it, they have a song that they sing which is sort of reminiscing or singing about their origin and their past suffering and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1321">Whenever they get together, they like to sing that song.</sentence><sentence id="1322">It's like an anthem or a hymn to them, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="1323">It mentions, it talks about teaching the children about the past, the need to teach them, to let them know what their forefathers went through.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1340">Q: Were you aware of any of that at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1342">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1348">Q: You mentioned that you had good friends who became ill and you were fourteen that 0 year.</sentence><sentence id="1349">Did you have any girlfriends while you were there?</sentence><sentence id="1350">Did you have that . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1354">A: Well, I think I fell in love with a couple of girls but I don't think that I had any, I mean, I never expressed my love and there was no kissing or hand holding or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1355">I think I was considered much too young at the time and so I never... I just think that this was my first love, you know, but there was never any physical contact or a relationship there.</sentence><sentence id="1356">I think we were all pretty young and pretty square in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1357">You just didn't do those sort of things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1362">Q: But it was a group of people that pretty much stayed together the whole time you were there, the ten months?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1364">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1366">Q: So you knew these people pretty well by then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1368">A: Yes, but even there, even in a small group like this, the people tended to form clicks, groups and the age range also was quite broad.</sentence><sentence id="1369">I think the youngest one in our group was probably ten or eleven and the oldest must have been sixteen or seventeen so although an age difference of four or five years, let's say may not be much when you're fifty, sixty or seventy.</sentence><sentence id="1370">When you're a teenager, one year of age difference or two years, that's like a generation apart and so you had on the one hand the older kids that would stick together with the older kids and then you had a further breakdown of people gravitating to one another by language group.</sentence><sentence id="1371">The Czechs, okay, there were three or four of them that were Czechs.</sentence><sentence id="1372">Well they would get together and speak Czech.</sentence><sentence id="1373">There were three or four German origin and they would get together and speak German.</sentence><sentence id="1374">The Spaniards and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1375">So you had these clans of groups that would form.</sentence><sentence id="1376">I was a loner.</sentence><sentence id="1377">I really didn't click with any group and this French boy, Amede Dutoit was his name, he was even more of a loner than I was than I was and I think that's why the two of us got together and we got along quite famously.</sentence><sentence id="1378">But he was an orphan and I think he was very sickly and he was probably brought up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> because they thought that the mountain air would be good for him and in those days people with TB were sent to sanatoria in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and so forth and so that's probably what brought him up there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1390">Q: How were you to find out that you were to leave there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1392">A: I think that my being sent away came in conjunction with Daniel Trocme's arrest.</sentence><sentence id="1393">I think when the German's arrested Daniel Trocme"", a) there was nobody else to take over at that point and they had to disperse the kids and I think b) they also were concerned that since Daniel was in charge of <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span>, anyone at <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons 1</span> might be easy prey and I think the decisions must have made, I'm assuming here, that we better disperse these kids and close down <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1394">I think Les Grillons supported, if not totally financed, it was supported by the Quakers.</sentence><sentence id="1395">The Quakers had very close ties with Pastor Trocme".</sentence><sentence id="1396">Trocme"", before the war, had been a pacifist and draft resistant.</sentence><sentence id="1397">He refused to serve in the French armed forces and urged other people to refuse to serve in the military and that's one of the reasons why they assigned him to <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>, which was a forlorn, God-forsaken place up there and they figured he wouldn't get headlines as he was getting in whatever <span class="BUILDING">parish</span> he had before.</sentence><sentence id="1398">That he was in a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the Protestants felt that his vociferous and noisy speeches about draft resisting and so forth are not helping their cause.</sentence><sentence id="1399">So they assigned him to Le Chambon parish and got him away from the headlines from the journalist and then he became the moral leader of <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1400">He never told people what they had to do.</sentence><sentence id="1401">He never told them you must hide people or you must take them in and there were, this is another one of the puzzling and remarkable things.</sentence><sentence id="1402">It wasn't managed where somebody says, okay, we're sending this guy here and that guy there and the next five who come in are going there, no, this was all spontaneous.</sentence><sentence id="1403">The people just knew what they had to do and did it.</sentence><sentence id="1404">In his sermons on Sunday, went back to the old testament to fundamentalist ideas and concepts.</sentence><sentence id="1405">If someone is sick, you go and visit them.</sentence><sentence id="1406">If someone is hungry, you give them something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1407">If someone is homeless, you provide them with a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1408">So, that was basically what drove these people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1426">Q: Do you remember seeing Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: I remember seeing Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1429">I know that there were some German soldiers who came on convalescent leave so it was sort of a R &amp; R rest and recuperation place and I don't remember how many but there have been about forty or fifty or so who occupied one or two <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there and if I remember correctly, they had all been wounded on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and so forth and they basically just wanted to get well and they didn't want to have trouble with anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1430">They pretty much kept to themselves and some historians who have looked into the past, into the history of <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>, think that that may also be one of the reasons why there was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="1431">These soldiers had gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1432">They didn't want to start hunting Jews or anybody else, just leave me alone.</sentence><sentence id="1433">Everyday that I can stay away from duty on the front somewhere, so much the better.</sentence><sentence id="1434">So, I had no trouble.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1442">Q: Did you ever go to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were making all the false documents?</sentence><sentence id="1443">Did you see the operation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1446">A: Not that I know of.</sentence><sentence id="1447">No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1452">Q: They provided you with what you needed to leave there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1454">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1455">Basically, the false names, the false identities that they gave us generally were the first name would start with the same letter as your real first name.</sentence><sentence id="1456">The last name would start with the same letter that your real name was.</sentence><sentence id="1457">Your birth date would remain the same.</sentence><sentence id="1458">The place of your birth would be changed so that they would drill into what's your name?</sentence><sentence id="1459">Okay, and make sure that you don't come up with your real name but that you come up with your new identity.</sentence><sentence id="1460">That, however, if your initials or if you were to start writing, you would naturally start writing the first letter of your first name P and hopefully by then you realize that it's not Peter or Pierre but it's Paul, okay?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1468">Q: Who did this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1470">A: Apparently, according, from the film, the Weapons of the Spirit, there was a particular individual was quite adapt at producing and forging documents at creating official stamps and so forth and he apparently was the primary individual who did this.</sentence><sentence id="1471">But he must have had help, that's true.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1474">Q: Do you remember someone coming to you and telling you what your new name was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1476">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1477">I remember being given a new identity and the papers and they were making sure that I understood that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luca</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, okay, the last place of residence was with my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span> but my birth date was still the 1" of March, 1929, and they took me through this repeatedly and made sure that somebody asked me what my name is, that's what it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1482">Q: Did they come to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> you were living and did this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1484">A: Yes, at <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1485">But, again, I mean, some of these things, you know, later on when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span>, I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1486">I had to take German, a mandatory course and I was first in class and I was correcting the teacher.</sentence><sentence id="1487">The teacher's German was atrocious.</sentence><sentence id="1488">Of course, in retrospect, it was stupid of me, okay, but it never occurred to me at time and to this day I still have a copy of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> transcript in my report card and the German teacher wrote down in the comments, very good student but must be careful not to fall asleep on very easily gained laurels or very easily acquired laurels.</sentence><sentence id="1489">He knew perfectly well that German had to have been my mother's language, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1490">I mean, that must have been obvious to him.</sentence><sentence id="1491">So, I was very lucky.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: You left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the winter?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1504">A: I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>, I think it must have been in December of 1943 or January of 1944, so I had about ten months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, the College Champollion, there were, I think, three or four other kids who had also come from <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span> with me.</sentence><sentence id="1505">I think two of them I knew from <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1506">Two of them was in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as I was.</sentence><sentence id="1507">Another one, the other two came from another <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1508">So, again, here you have a situation where undoubtedly the principal or whoever was in charge of that <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> knew perfectly well that he was accepting some students of questionable background but they also protected us.</sentence><sentence id="1509">The interesting thing about the Figeac episode is that I became involved at that point in resistance activities.</sentence><sentence id="1510">The Germans used the <span class="BUILDING">schoolyard</span> as a <span class="DLF">parking lot</span> and at night a couple of other guys and I, we would scrape together whatever sugar we could find in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> and so on and we would pour it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas tanks</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> and the next morning, we just loved to watch them try to get the engines started and started, and if they stayed in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> long enough, and after about fifteen minutes or so of idling, all of sudden the engine stopped.</sentence><sentence id="1511">The engine was all gummed up.</sentence><sentence id="1512">We enjoyed it even more when this happened and then they drove out of the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> right away and we knew that about a half a mile down the <span class="DLF">road</span>, they're going to get stuck.</sentence><sentence id="1513">We would slash their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tires</span> and force them to change wheels and so forth on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1514">Somehow the Germans didn't enjoy this very much and they started to play pretty rough in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and started to round some of the kids up and so forth and some of the teachers must have been in contact with the Maquis of the French underground and I was called out a few times to help them with translation, translating German letters or documents that they found.</sentence><sentence id="1515">At a certain point also, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Maquis</span> attacked the only major <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which was a <span class="BUILDING">propeller factory</span> making propellers for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German fighter planes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1516">The Allies had tried to bomb that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> repeatedly and they could never succeed because it was geographically in a very awkward <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1517">It was in an elbow of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, a bend of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> on both sides so they couldn't attack it by dive bombing and they could only try to hit it from high altitude and they never could and it was a critical <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> because it was the only <span class="BUILDING">research factory</span> in the world at that time that were producing those kind of variable pitch propellers.</sentence><sentence id="1518">So, the Maquis was asked to go and blow it up and I tagged along with the group the night that they went into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I think it was ten or eleven plastic explosive charges that they planted on the equipment used to make those propellers and destroy it.</sentence><sentence id="1519">Shortly after that the Germans then came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and rounded up all the male citizens between the ages of sixteen and fifty-four, I believe it was, and shipped them off to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">Now, I happen to have learned just last summer that because I went to a commemoration of a round up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span> last summer, I found out that the division that came and rounded up everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Figeac</span>, it was the same division that two 4 weeks later destroyed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of, I can't think of the name of it, a <span class="DLF">mental block</span>, anyhow it will come back to me, they rounded up all the people, shot them and of the people that survived, they were mostly woman and children and babies.</sentence><sentence id="1521">They were bundled off into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they then set the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on fire and then burned them alive and three or four of them tried to escape through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and they were shot as they tried to come out.</sentence><sentence id="1522">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oradour Sur Olane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1523">Okay, and it was 638 people who were killed and massacred there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1544">Q: The same division?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1546">A: The same division, the division Das Reich.</sentence><sentence id="1547">Figeac is in the Department du Lot.</sentence><sentence id="1548">It's near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhone valley</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1549">I think it's south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span>, southwest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1566">Q: But they came and they rounded up .. .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1568">A: So they rounded up all the male citizens.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1580">Q: Adjoining it?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1712">Q: Were you hiding in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stall</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1714">A: We were lying in the, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span>, on the, whatever was on the floor of the, on the ground of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, pine needles, brushes, and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1716">Q: There were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1718">A: There were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, yes, lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> around.</sentence><sentence id="1719">And we could see the, you could just make out the <span class="DLF">border</span>, the barbed-wire fence.</sentence><sentence id="1720">And periodically we could see soldiers walking in one direction or the other.</sentence><sentence id="1721">And so around 1:00 o'clock, I think, afternoon, activity, the whistles, could hear some dogs barking, we said, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="1722">And we jumped up, and we started to head for the barbed-wire fence.</sentence><sentence id="1723">I upped first friends into "no man's land".</sentence><sentence id="1724">Half way through the "no man's land" I hear people screaming, I hear some shots ring out.</sentence><sentence id="1725">I don't stop, I keep going to the second <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and I go up.</sentence><sentence id="1726">Just about to start the second <span class="DLF">fence</span>, I see this outline, this silhouette of a soldier standing there wearing a <span class="DLF">field</span>, field-green, field-gray uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1727">My first reaction was, it's a German.</sentence><sentence id="1728">And then I looked again and I said, no.</sentence><sentence id="1729">The, his helmet looked different and he was carrying his rifle in a fashion I had never seen a German carry a rifle.</sentence><sentence id="1730">This man was cradling the rifle in his arms like a baby.</sentence><sentence id="1731">So I, up on the second <span class="DLF">fence</span> and over it and he was motionless until I was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and touched the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1732">Then he just motioned to me and said, "Get behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>," in French.</sentence><sentence id="1733">There was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1734">And now I knew I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1735">Well, apparently, what had happened is that some of the other kids, one a girl, got over the first <span class="DLF">fence</span> and she saw the soldier who I had seen, and she thought it was a German.</sentence><sentence id="1736">So she thought she had made a wrong turn, or something was wrong, and she began to scream, "The Germans are there, the Germans are there," and she turned around to head back to where she had come.</sentence><sentence id="1737">She became totally disoriented.</sentence><sentence id="1738">And two other people, equally confused, didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1739">And during that period, the Germans started to open fire.</sentence><sentence id="1740">So, I think, out of a group of about 10 people, seven of us, we made it across.</sentence><sentence id="1741">I have no way of knowing what happened to the other three.</sentence><sentence id="1742">And once we were all safely behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, then the Swiss soldier went <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, picked up his telephone, called, and we waited there and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swiss Army truck</span> came out about a half of an hour later, loaded us onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and took us to a <span class="BUILDING">refugee center</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="1743">And I remember the drive into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1744">There were <span class="BUILDING">grocery stores</span> and so forth, and they had displays on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> outside the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1745">And I saw things I hadn't seen in four years, things called bananas and oranges and, I mean those, we didn't know, we had forgotten what they were practically because those are grown in <span class="REGION">tropical areas</span> and during the war years they just didn't come into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1746">And so I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlaraffenland</span>, which is what you call it in German.</sentence><sentence id="1747">It was, you know, the 8 land of milk and honey all of a sudden.</sentence><sentence id="1748">And we, we were interrogated by the Swiss authorities and they were going to ship us back.</sentence><sentence id="1749">But during my interrogation, I pointed out that my father had had business friends, business contacts in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and I remembered the name of one family, and I gave the name and told them, "I remember the name of the company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span>," and I gave them the name of the company.</sentence><sentence id="1750">So they contacted that <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> apparently.</sentence><sentence id="1751">And the family said, "Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1752">We know Mr. Feigl."</sentence><sentence id="1753">So they decided to take me in.</sentence><sentence id="1754">So that enabled me to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1755">So I was given refugee status in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span>, stayed with that family, they sent me to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1756">I was undisciplined at the time, created problems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, was disruptive.</sentence><sentence id="1757">After a year the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wanted to get rid of me.</sentence><sentence id="1758">With the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> wanting to get rid, get me out, expel me, the family had had enough of me, they didn't want me anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1759">So I was turned over to the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1760">They placed me in a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> for about two months until they found another <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="1761">I was sent to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Ecole D'Humanite</span>", which was another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was run by a saintly man who had studied in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> and was a friend of Rabin Pra Nath Tagore, a famous Indian philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="1762">He tried to apply some of his learnings, what he had learned in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1763">Again, I was being rebellious.</sentence><sentence id="1764">I wouldn't comply with the rules.</sentence><sentence id="1765">So after three months I got thrown out of there.</sentence><sentence id="1766">I was then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">Ort school</span> where they would teach me some mechanical trade.</sentence><sentence id="1767">They found a Catholic family to, with whom I could live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1768">And after 60 days they couldn't take me anymore and they begged the Red Cross to get me out of their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and find some other <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="1769">I then wound up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children's camp</span>, there were about 40 of us living in this large <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1770">And I, during that period I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">Ort school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1771">And this is also the period during which, I guess when I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> in 1945 probably, or 1944, late 1944, early 1945, I first was able to reestablish contact with my relatives through the International Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1772">They had been searching for me and for my parents through the <span class="BUILDING">International Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And so I think I first heard from my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, the Kleczewers.</sentence><sentence id="1774">And shortly after that I heard from my relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, from my grandmother, my uncle, and my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="1775">And they then told me that they would enable me to get a visa to come and join then in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1776">And ultimately, in 1946, in July of 1946, I did make it to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1777">My uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> insisted that I pay for my own ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1778">Since I couldn't pay for it, he advanced the money.</sentence><sentence id="1779">But I had to sign a promissory note to reimburse him for the cost of the ticket, the voucher and the ship fare, which I repaid.</sentence><sentence id="1780">And I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in July of 1946 with the same backpack that I had when I crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> and I had seven dollars on me and a change of clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1781">And my English, basically, consisted of "The <span class="DLF">door</span> is open," "The <span class="DLF">window</span> is shut," "John is a boy," "Mary is a girl," with a heavy French accent.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1927">A: Well, coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, it was very exciting to see the Statue of Liberty, and 0 coming into the <span

had seen it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1933">So what's the big deal, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1934">I mean, I knew what the <span

<span class="REGION">New York State</span> was concerned, they had a board of regents, they evaluated the few school records that I had with me, which weren't many.</sentence><sentence id="1945">I had

that.</sentence><sentence id="1952">By now, everyone had, everyone had learned that when you arrive in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> they would ask you what your occupation

intellectual you went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1955">So they wanted to make sure that for the next time that this happens that I would be prepared and I would be among those who would be selected to work.</sentence><sentence id="1956">I didn't want that either.</sentence><sentence id="1957">I, because I wanted to earn money.</sentence><sentence id="1958">I wanted to have my own money and buy things, meet girls, take them out for a milkshake or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1959">And so against their advice I got my first job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> in a dye and tool making place, based on my experience and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1960">And they hired me as a, as a apprentice machinist.</sentence><sentence id="1961">I objected in my lousy English at the time and said, "I do the same work as the man next to me.</sentence><sentence id="1962">Why am I being paid as an apprentice, and he's getting full union wages?".</sentence><sentence id="1963">And so he promised me a raise.</sentence><sentence id="1964">And I waited for six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1965">And when the raise didn't come, oh, he, after six weeks he finally decided, okay, here's your raise.</sentence><sentence id="1966">And it was five cents an hour.</sentence><sentence id="1967">And I asked him, I said, "Is that my raise?".</sentence><sentence id="1968">And he said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="1969">I said, "Forget it.</sentence><sentence id="1970">I don't want this job."</sentence><sentence id="1971">And I took my coveralls off and I left.</sentence><sentence id="1972">And again, my relatives were very upset about this.</sentence><sentence id="1973">And I said, "Oh, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="1974">I'll find another job."</sentence><sentence id="1975">And 1 three days later, I had a job at <span class="BUILDING">Montgomery Ward</span> as a mail clerk.</sentence><sentence id="1976">I was earning 10 cents an hour more than I was getting at <span class="BUILDING">machine tool shop</span>, and it was a white collar job.</sentence><sentence id="1977">I didn't get my fingers dirty, and I didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with metal filings in my, in my skin, and that launched me on a white collar career.</sentence><sentence id="1978">And from then on, I waited until I was 18, and on my is" birthday I decided to join the Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="1979">And I wanted to be a pilot.</sentence><sentence id="1980">Remember when they were being attacked and shot at by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German dive bombers</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1981">I wanted to be a pilot.</sentence><sentence id="1982">So I went into the Air Force and, once I was in, learned belatedly that since I was not a citizen I could not become a pilot.</sentence><sentence id="1983">Because to be a pilot you had to be an officer.</sentence><sentence id="1984">To be an officer you have to be a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1985">So I was stuck in the Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="1986">And I was given the opportunity to go to any <span class="BUILDING">Air Force school</span> that I wanted to, except cryptographer.</sentence><sentence id="1987">Because, again, I wasn't a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1988">And to get into cryptography, code breaking or code making, you had to, you had to be a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1989">So I picked three <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1990">And after I finished my basic training everybody lined up and received their assignments to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1991">And I said, "Hey, Sarge, how about me?</sentence><sentence id="1992">You didn't call my name."</sentence><sentence id="1993">He said, "Oh, you're a lucky bastard.</sentence><sentence id="1994">You don't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1995">So I was sent to Air Technical Intelligence at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base because I spoke French and German fluently, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1996">So I became a translator.</sentence><sentence id="1997">And that really was the blessing in because I had a lot of time.</sentence><sentence id="1998">I spent three years translating or abstracting captured German documents that covered every branch of science you can imagine, from propellants to <span class="BUILDING">oil refineries</span> to aerodynamics, meteorology, and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1999">And with each new document I had the time to go to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, immerse myself in the vocabulary and the language of the <span class="DLF">field</span> and I learned a lot that way.</sentence><sentence id="2000">I mean, a lot of it rubbed off.</sentence><sentence id="2001">And after three years in the Air Force I came out and had a difficult time at first finding a job, this is now 1950, and ultimately got a job with American Express Company as a translator at a ridiculous $35 a week.</sentence><sentence id="2002">But I had a policy.</sentence><sentence id="2003">My policy is as soon as you have a job in hand immediately start looking for a better job.</sentence><sentence id="2004">And Ino sooner starting working at <span class="BUILDING">American Express</span> than I was looking at ten, twelve different other <span class="NPIP">places</span> trying to get another job.</sentence><sentence id="2005">And six weeks after I started with American Express I get a response to one of my job applications to do the same work I was doing in the Air Force for a civilian contractor back in Wright Field paying me $75 a week, going from $35 to $75 a week.</sentence><sentence id="2006">That was pretty good.</sentence><sentence id="2007">So I moved to, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, in 1950.</sentence><sentence id="2008">And I did that for about two years.</sentence><sentence id="2009">I warned my boss at the time that he wasn't looking after the business properly, that he's going to lose the contract.</sentence><sentence id="2010">That is exactly what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2011">And the day it happened, we were driving back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I saw a sign that said, "Your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> needs policemen."</sentence><sentence id="2012">So now, I'll become a cop, and took the Civil Service Test and wound up at the top of the list, and in spite of the fact that I was six pounds underweight they decided that because of my good test scores they will take me.</sentence><sentence id="2013">So I became a cop for a year.</sentence><sentence id="2014">I saw a lot of things that I didn't like there.</sentence><sentence id="2015">First of all, they put me on the Vice Squad because I was unknown and I was a fairly handsome kid.</sentence><sentence id="2016">So they thought that they'll 2 use him to entrap people and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="2017">And I saw a lot of things going on in the Police Department that I didn't like.</sentence><sentence id="2018">I mean, this was a time, this was in 1952.Most of the policemen in those days had a ninth grade education.</sentence><sentence id="2019">They were dishonest, they were drunkards, a lot of, that was too much for me to stomach.</sentence><sentence id="2020">And after eleven months I had a run-in with my captain, police captain, and he told me, "You don't make arrests in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you stay out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and leave these people alone."</sentence><sentence id="2021">I said, "Hey, wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="2022">I took an oath to enforce the law equally, no matter who it is."</sentence><sentence id="2023">And if I did make an arrest, he would destroy my evidence so I had no case when it came to <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2024">And I finally said, "The hell with this.</sentence><sentence id="2025">I don't need this.</sentence><sentence id="2026">I quit."</sentence><sentence id="2027">And I became, my next job was as a, what is called an assistant manager for a <span class="BUILDING">personal finance corporation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2028">That's a small <span class="BUILDING">loan company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2029">The assistant manager really is a collector, people who don't pay their loans.</sentence><sentence id="2030">Well, I did that for about three months and I couldn't stomach waiting for people to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with their paycheck and squeezing five bucks, or two bucks or what have you out of them.</sentence><sentence id="2031">So I was looking for something else at the time and managed to get myself a job with Chrysler Aiv-Temp as an assistant engineer.</sentence><sentence id="2032">And don't ask me how I wound up as an assistant engineer and made now twice what I was making on the Police Department.</sentence><sentence id="2033">About this time, the Chief of Police called me and said, won't I please come back?</sentence><sentence id="2034">If I read the paper tomorrow, I'll find that captain whatever his name is has decided that his health isn't so good, he's going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> to retire.</sentence><sentence id="2035">And I said, "Thank very much, Chief.</sentence><sentence id="2036">But I'm now making twice what I was making before.</sentence><sentence id="2037">And I'm not working swing shifts.</sentence><sentence id="2038">I'm working on a regular schedule.</sentence><sentence id="2039">Thank you very much."</sentence><sentence id="2040">And then I got together with a fellow who I worked with as a contracted translator.</sentence><sentence id="2041">And we decided to try to get the contract ourselves, form a company and see if we couldn't get contract, the translation contract.</sentence><sentence id="2042">So I found an organization, an existing corporation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, and convinced them that they should back us financially.</sentence><sentence id="2043">And they did.</sentence><sentence id="2044">And they established a subsidiary.</sentence><sentence id="2045">And I became the general manager of the subsidiary.</sentence><sentence id="2046">And I was now making $100 a week.</sentence><sentence id="2047">And we got the contract.</sentence><sentence id="2048">The Air Force felt that they had been pressured in giving us the contract, and they killed us with kindness.</sentence><sentence id="2049">After one year the thing collapsed and I went looking for another job.</sentence><sentence id="2050">And I decided that there is no future in the <span class="BUILDING">translation business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2051">I got to get out of this.</sentence><sentence id="2052">So finally, I got a job with Curtiss-Wright, which was an aircraft engine manufacturer at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2053">And I became, what the heck was it, I guess it was a, I know, engineer, engineering, a spare parts engineering liaison department, and it was analyzing engineering change orders.</sentence><sentence id="2054">Anyhow, I told them that I was prepared to take a pay cut if they'll give me a chance, watch what I'm doing and if in six months I am performing as expected then I would expect them to raise my money back to my salary, back to what I was earlier earning before, if not I'll leave and forget about it.</sentence><sentence id="2055">And four months later, they raised my salary back to the $100 a week and promoted me.</sentence><sentence id="2056">So everything was fine.</sentence><sentence id="2057">I was with them for about four years, meantime looking for another job.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2192">Q: Let me ask you a question here.</sentence><sentence id="2193">Clearly you made rapid success . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2196">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2198">Q: ... in business.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2200">A: Can't complain.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2202">Q: You did.</sentence><sentence id="2203">And I mean, you had confidence . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2206">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q: ... sounds like.</sentence><sentence id="2209">You had your, always had your eye on something better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2212">A: Better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2214">Q: What does that have to do with your experience growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2216">A: I think all I can say is that the war years had taught me to stand on my own two legs.</sentence><sentence id="2217">And I think my mother probably gave me some inspiration too, stand up for your rights.</sentence><sentence id="2218">She used to have a motto, "Wenn man dir gibt, nimm.</sentence><sentence id="2219">Wenn man dir nimmt, schrei," which means, translated it means, if someone is giving you something, take it.</sentence><sentence id="2220">If someone tries to take something away from you, holler.</sentence><sentence id="2221">So, but I think, basically I think I had become self-reliant long before and realized if I don't do it, it's not going to get done.</sentence><sentence id="2222">And I was very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="2223">I mean, my wife keeps reminding me that luck plays some part in it too, possibly.</sentence><sentence id="2224">Looks probably also has something to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="2225">I had more hair in the past.</sentence><sentence id="2226">And I was tall, which also helps generally when people hire.</sentence><sentence id="2227">Apparently, subconsciously, they tend to gravitate towards a taller person, projects more authority or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2228">And so at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curtiss-Wright</span> I next was offered a job with an <span class="BUILDING">aviation export company</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Manhattan</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2229">And they needed a technical director, oh in the meantime I had paid, out of my own pocket, I had paid for pilot lessons and I had learned to fly.</sentence><sentence id="2230">I had gotten my pilot's license.</sentence><sentence id="2231">And the technical director was also supposed to be responsible for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> sales and he had to have a pilot's license.</sentence><sentence id="2232">So they offered me the job.</sentence><sentence id="2233">I spoke French, German.</sentence><sentence id="2234">It was all international marketing.</sentence><sentence id="2235">When I told Curtiss-Wright I was leaving, they made, they asked me how much I had been offered by the company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I told them.</sentence><sentence id="2236">And they said, we will match it and add $1,000 to it.</sentence><sentence id="2237">We want you to stay.</sentence><sentence id="2238">I went back to the man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I said, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2239">You won't believe this.</sentence><sentence id="2240">But they just matched your offer and added another $1,000 a year to it.</sentence><sentence id="2241">And he said, "Look, I want you."</sentence><sentence id="2242">If you promise that you will come to work for 4 me I will match what Curtiss-Wright has offered you and add another $1,000."</sentence><sentence id="2243">I said, "You got me."</sentence><sentence id="2244">So I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curtiss-Wright</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2245">I spent the next four years with Aviquipo, a company in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2246">And during that time, again, I was looking out for something better to do and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2247">This, by the way, this job involved a tremendous amount of traveling overseas where I got to use my languages and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2248">I traveled all over world selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and ground support equipment for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jetliners</span> that were then coming onto the scene.</sentence><sentence id="2249">And finally I was offered a job as a director of international marketing for, by a helicopter manufacturer up in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2250">And he offered to pay me 50 percent more than what I was getting in the previous job.</sentence><sentence id="2251">So that didn't take long, and I accepted.</sentence><sentence id="2252">And fortunately, I had a wife who went along with this.</sentence><sentence id="2253">And it wasn't easy for her, moving <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2254">But, so we moved to <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2255">And I was there for three years.</sentence><sentence id="2256">And after three years of traveling all over the world again I came to the conclusion that this manufacturer, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Comman Aircraft</span> (ph), wasn't ever going to sell another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2257">So I went, I talked to the president of the company and I told Charlie Comman, I said, "I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="2258">But as I see it now I don't think you have a Chinaman's chance of selling another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2259">You might as well take the money you spend on international marketing and flush it down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2260">It'll have the same effect."</sentence><sentence id="2261">He said, "Well, I appreciate your candor.</sentence><sentence id="2262">But you're telling me I don't need you anymore."</sentence><sentence id="2263">And I said, "Well, I hope that maybe you can use me on the <span class="REGION">domestic side</span> or something."</sentence><sentence id="2264">He said, "Well, I'll keep you on the payroll until you have another job."</sentence><sentence id="2265">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2266">Of course, we're selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopters</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military helicopters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2267">There were contacts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2268">And I called up an Air Force colonel I had been dealing with to find out whether the Air Force had succeeded in, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span>'s, getting the Iraqis to buy our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">helicopters</span>, and he said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="2269">And he said, "What else are you doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2270">I said, "Well, to tell you the truth, I'm looking for a job.</sentence><sentence id="2271">But I don't know how to go about it."</sentence><sentence id="2272">I said, "I figured that with my knowledge of languages and the traveling I've done, there must be something I can do, either in the commerce department as a commercial counselor at an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> or in the State Department.</sentence><sentence id="2273">What, how do you go about it?".</sentence><sentence id="2274">And he said, "Would you consider working for the Defense Department?"</sentence><sentence id="2275">I said, "Defense Department?</sentence><sentence id="2276">Doing what?".</sentence><sentence id="2277">And he said, "Well, we have a GS15 opening."</sentence><sentence id="2278">And I said, "What's a GS15?"</sentence><sentence id="2279">He said, "Oh, that's the equivalent of a full Coronal.</sentence><sentence id="2280">I said, "That still doesn't tell me.</sentence><sentence id="2281">Money.</sentence><sentence id="2282">How much does it pay?"</sentence><sentence id="2283">He said, "Oh, it's about $14,200."</sentence><sentence id="2284">And this is 1963 now.</sentence><sentence id="2285">And I said, "Well, that's a little less than what I'm making now.</sentence><sentence id="2286">But I'm at a dead end.</sentence><sentence id="2287">So, yes, I'm interested."</sentence><sentence id="2288">So he said, "Well, I'll set up an interview for you."</sentence><sentence id="2289">So the next day I was interviewed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs.</sentence><sentence id="2290">And after an hour of interview he said, "Welcome aboard."</sentence><sentence id="2291">So I went to work for the Defense Department.</sentence><sentence id="2292">And I stayed there, well until all of my clearances and everything had come through, by the way, I was told, "Welcome aboard," the day before Kennedy was assassinated, and it was on the next day that I was flying back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to 5 <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> when I heard Kennedy was shot and my first thought was oh shoot.</sentence><sentence id="2293">There goes the job.</sentence><sentence id="2294">But no, I was kept.</sentence><sentence id="2295">And I, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, my wife and two daughters in February of 1964.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: I guess I have told them, and I'm sure my wife has also told them never, I don't think, in a chronological order as we have just done it here during this interview.</sentence><sentence id="2457">How much my children have remembered I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2458">How much they can put together and sort out chronologically I don't know either.</sentence><sentence id="2459">If there is one thing that I've learned, I discovered what is meant by "generation gap."</sentence><sentence id="2460">And just as I could not understand what my father was talking about when he was talking to a nine, or a ten, or an eleven-year-old and retelling his exploits on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Austrian submarine</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>, that when he was in military service and he's Admiral Horthy, what's an Admiral, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2461">I mean, it didn't mean anything to me.</sentence><sentence id="2462">And I would hear the stories time and time again.</sentence><sentence id="2463">And I guess, subconsciously, I was saying to myself, here the old man goes again telling me about his stupid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span>, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2464">So I realized that, you haven't lived it.</sentence><sentence id="2465">It's very, very hard to identify with it, to become involved in it, to get emotionally involved in something.</sentence><sentence id="2466">And the best example I have there is that with all the food shortages and so forth that I've experienced in my life it goes against my grain when I see people leaving food on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plate</span>, which is also why I'm getting fat, because I've got to finish what's on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2467">And if there is some left in the pot that has to be eaten too because you can't throw it away.</sentence><sentence id="2468">And so we used to tell the children, "Eat the food on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2469">There are people starving in the world.</sentence><sentence id="2470">There are people hungry in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2471">There are people hungry here and there."</sentence><sentence id="2472">And then one day I realized, how on earth can we expect the children to know what hunger is when after every dinner they have a very important decision to make: Do I now eat two scoops of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate ice cream or should it be two scoops of chocolate and one of them vanilla?</sentence><sentence id="2473">So it's totally unreasonable to try to expect the other generation to understand this.</sentence><sentence id="2474">Now, perhaps as they get older, our children are now, the oldest one just turned 38 and the younger one is 34.</sentence><sentence id="2475">They're four years apart.</sentence><sentence id="2476">Maybe, as they get older, they might reflect and think back about where their parents were, what they did, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2477">I did find, last summer, when we were in 7 <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> I found the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of my grandmother, my father's mother, and of his father.</sentence><sentence id="2478">And I had it restored.</sentence><sentence id="2479">So, but that's also something that I wouldn't have given a second thought to 20 years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2506">A: I guess it's, my days are numbered I guess.</sentence><sentence id="2507">And if someday our children do want to know where do they, where are their roots, where do they come from, there's something for them to go to.</sentence><sentence id="2508">I mean, fortunately, there's nothing for them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2601">A: I have accepted it and moved on beyond it.</sentence><sentence id="2602">I mean, this goes back to what I told you earlier, that I consider it an act, some people may think it's a curse.</sentence><sentence id="2603">But it's an act that drives my wife up the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2604">The ability that, for instance, some of these <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> I've worked for, the <span class="BUILDING">company</span> stood on the verge of bankruptcy, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2605">I would leave the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on Friday, 5:30 p.m., and I would kind of switch up there in the brain and it was out of my mind and I wouldn't think about it again until the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="2606">Not while I was driving to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2607">When I entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, then the switch was turned on again and then I started to worry about the problem, what to do next.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2617">A: And that's what I've been able to do, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2618">I just, unpleasant things, I just shun them aside and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2619">It may be good, it may be bad.</sentence><sentence id="2620">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2621">I haven't discussed it with a psychiatrist.</sentence><sentence id="2622">Every so often my wife says maybe I should go into analysis.</sentence><sentence id="2623">Then I say to her, "Well, if I do, and supposing I discover that I can't live with myself, what do I do then?</sentence><sentence id="2624">I'm quite happy now."</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2639">A: We're looking at a postcard that was taken probably in the late 1930s of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which is marked Pension De Famille.</sentence><sentence id="2640">It was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed and breakfast</span>, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="2641">And that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a solid <span class="BUILDING">house</span> built of rocks, the <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I lived from the time that I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span> in the beginning of 1943, until I left in late 1943, it was called <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2642">And Daniel Trocme" was the den father, I guess you would call it, who looked after us in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2643">I've visited that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, by the way, recently.</sentence><sentence id="2644">And not much has changed.</sentence><sentence id="2645">It looks pretty much the same as it was, including the <span class="DLF">water trough</span> that you see to the far right of the picture.</sentence><sentence id="2646">Here is a group shot taken in front of <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2647">You can see the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the 9 back.</sentence><sentence id="2648">This is a picture probably of all the kids who were housed there.</sentence><sentence id="2649">You can see that there are some very young ones in the front row.</sentence><sentence id="2650">One of them was the daughter of the cook.</sentence><sentence id="2651">And one of them, the little blonde girl in the front with the bow in her hair, she was a sister of the Czech boy who was there.</sentence><sentence id="2652">In the picture also, in the back row, in the center, the man with the eye glasses, that is Daniel Trocme".</sentence><sentence id="2653">And to the left of Daniel Trocme", or to his right, you see another adult.</sentence><sentence id="2654">And that is pastor Theis, who was the assistant Pastor at the <span class="BUILDING">Protestant Church</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2655">I am just barely visible.</sentence><sentence id="2656">My face is obscured by the shadows, the shadow cast by the <span

out my face.</sentence><sentence id="2659">Here is a page from my first diary.</sentence><sentence id="2660">This is a diary I'd begun the day I learned my parents had been arrested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span>, August, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="2661">The page that you're looking at on the right, it says, in German, Neu Johr, New Year, 1943.</sentence><sentence id="2662">Since I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, throughout my diary, there are notations in German, which I thought was a language that the French wouldn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="2663">So if I wanted to say something that I didn't want the French to know I would write it down in German.</sentence><sentence id="2664">The two photographs are of my mother and my father.</sentence><sentence id="2665">They are passport photographs.</sentence><sentence id="2666">I remember where they were taken.</sentence><sentence id="2667">They were with an amateur camera.</sentence><sentence id="2668">We couldn't afford to go to a photographer at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2669">And it was taken in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auch</span>, where my father kept his rabbits and chickens and a <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2670">And they just sat in front of the, that <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2671">And those pictures were necessary to apply for all kinds of official documents, visa applications, travel documents, and so forth, which my parents never ceased to fill out and file for.</sentence><sentence id="2672">The original of this diary has been donated by me to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2673">It's in the archives now.</sentence><sentence id="2674">I also made one translation of the diary back in, I think it was in late 1978, 1979 or early 1980.</sentence><sentence id="2675">I also provided a copy of that translation to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2676">About 10 years later, I went through this diary a second time through a translation.</sentence><sentence id="2677">And I then remembered many abbreviations that I used that I, originally, couldn't decipher.</sentence><sentence id="2678">I didn't know what they meant.</sentence><sentence id="2679">But in the second translation which I made and which I have also given to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> I have translated or explained what these abbreviations mean.</sentence><sentence id="2680">And also, throughout, I gave additional amplification or explanations in square brackets of things that might not be understood by a casual reader.</sentence><sentence id="2681">This is one of the photographs that was taken of me at <span class="BUILDING">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2682">It's one of the passport pictures that was used by the document forgers to come with a false document, false identity papers and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2683">And as I mentioned I think before, we were all given copies of these photographs.</sentence><sentence id="2684">And whatever number of pictures we didn't actually use we then started to dedicate them to our friends and exchange them.</sentence><sentence id="2685">And that is how I came into possession of some 30-some photographs, these passport photographs, from the other people hidden at <span class="BUILDING">Les Grillon</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Chambon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2686">And my entire collection of these photographs I have also dedicated to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2687">As you can see, I had a lot more hair then.</sentence><sentence id="2688">0
