<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Very much family oriented.</sentence><sentence id="137">I want to divert, I think one of the great tragedies of today's life is the fact that so many kids grow up without families.</sentence><sentence id="138">I can't imagine not having grown up in a family, as part of a family.</sentence><sentence id="139">And, obviously, when I was -- by the time was five or six my oldest brothers had already gone off to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">But we all came back for Christmas, and I can still remember the family gatherings at Christmas and other special occasions.</sentence><sentence id="141">My two sisters ran a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and two of my brothers also became ministers and the other brother was a businessman and then there was me.</sentence><sentence id="142">And, well, we lived through some difficult times.</sentence><sentence id="143">A minister's salary, I don't know about nowadays, but in those days was not very adequate.</sentence><sentence id="144">And we lived through First, when I was born in 1914, right at the beginning of the First World War, and so my father had to bring up eight children.</sentence><sentence id="145">And so we were all very busy.</sentence><sentence id="146">My sisters realized that being two ladies amongst -- two girls amongst -- with six boys, that unless they put their foot down very early on they would finish up by being kind of housekeepers.</sentence><sentence id="147">So we all had duties, somebody had to do the washing out, somebody else had to clean all the shoes, somebody else had to make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">And we were a fairly close-knit family.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="278">And before the war started I had been involved somewhat with the Quakers and their work and the victims of the Spanish Civil War.</sentence><sentence id="279">And, in fact, my wife is a Basque from the north of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">When the Spanish Civil War broke out, the British government sent over a mission to bring over children from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to look after them while the war was going on.</sentence><sentence id="281">The idea was that it would be a temporary arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="282">And with every 40 children they sent one teacher.</sentence><sentence id="283">And they asked various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> all over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> if they would take one group of these children.</sentence><sentence id="284">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I was working, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span>, said they would take a group.</sentence><sentence id="285">And they asked for volunteers, and I volunteered to help prepare the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> where the kids were going to live.</sentence><sentence id="286">And then later they asked me if I would go and live in the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span>, because there were 40 children and two girls, two teachers, a teacher and a teacher's aid.</sentence><sentence id="287">And there were a lot of chores to do about the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they wanted some manpower, so they asked me to go live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">I went to live in the .</sentence><sentence id="291">. Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 8 <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> every day as usual.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="321">Q: Now, was this your first association with the Quakers?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="327">previously?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: But that had some special appeal to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Well, I was there, you know.</sentence><sentence id="333">The children came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span>, and then one of my friends was a Quaker, who was very much involved in developing this project.</sentence><sentence id="334">And he said, you know, we need somebody to help, how about it?</sentence><sentence id="335">And I said, fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: So it was through a friend in large part?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: A friend, yes.</sentence><sentence id="345">So then also I had some kind of sympathy with the Quaker point of view.</sentence><sentence id="346">In fact, I was a conscientious objector during the war and worked on the <span class="REGION">land</span> when I was called up, and had in the meantime registered with the Quakers as a volunteer for any work they wanted me to do.</sentence><sentence id="347">And in 1944 --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Could you -- could we back up?</sentence><sentence id="355">Could you say a little bit more about the working on</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="358">the <span class="REGION">land</span>?</sentence><sentence id="359">You were called up for the Army and you said that you were a conscientious</sentence></p><p><sentence id="360">objector?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: I went to the <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and they were very fair, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="362">They listened to what I had to say and their first response was, well, we think you are quite sincere, but wrong, and so you had better go work in the Army medical corps.</sentence><sentence id="363">And I said, no, I wouldn't do that because that would mean I wouldn't be bearing witness that I was a conscientious objector because .</sentence><sentence id="366">. Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 9 I would be wearing a cocky uniform like everybody else and I wouldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="367">And so then they went back and forth some more.</sentence><sentence id="368">And they came back and said, in that case you will work on the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="369">And I said, well, that's fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: So you did that in what capacity?</sentence><sentence id="388">Was it a government unit that you were with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Well, no, they gave me so many days to find a job on the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="395">A: And I went to one of the local farmers and he looked at me in my office clothes and kind of grinned and he said, well, I disagree with you, but I need -- we need workers, and if you want to come and work for me, you can.</sentence><sentence id="396">But you are going to have to work as a -- just like a laborer.</sentence><sentence id="397">There is no fancy business.</sentence><sentence id="398">And so I did.</sentence><sentence id="399">I worked on the <span class="REGION">land</span> and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: Was that a difficult decision for you to make?</sentence><sentence id="409">To take that course?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: Yeah, because -- because lots of people that I very greatly admired disagreed with me.</sentence><sentence id="413">My own family --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Your family disagreed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="418">A: Well, they didn't support me.</sentence><sentence id="419">I mean, my brother-in-law was an officer in the Army and my brothers were both ministers at that time, and so that one of my brothers was working for the Navy.</sentence><sentence id="420">So I was the only one who became a conscientious objector and went to a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="421">But the family were very supportive, again, they didn't agree with me, but that didn't affect their affection for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="430">Q: Was there -- did you have anybody or any people who did agree with you and could</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="432">support you with their agreement?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="433">A: Well, of course, a lot of the Quakers were passivists.</sentence><sentence id="434">And on the <span class="REGION">land</span>, I was working on .</sentence><sentence id="437">. Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 10 this big <span class="DLF">farm</span> and there were quite a lot of other conscientious objectors all working on the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="438">And so that, well, you weren't entirely alone.</sentence><sentence id="439">On the other hand, there were a lot of people who very vehemently disagreed with us and didn't -- didn't bother to hide their feelings.</sentence><sentence id="440">Indeed, when I got married, in those days accommodation was very difficult and you were appointed <span class="NPIP">places</span> to live.</sentence><sentence id="441">That is to say, if you couldn't find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- and teachers had a priority.</sentence><sentence id="442">And my wife was teaching in the <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> for little children, so she had a priority and she got a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, found a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="443">But when we went there, the landlady said -- looked at me and said I understand you are a conscientious objector, and I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="444">And she said, well, you're not going to live in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="445">And so we had to go find somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="446">But --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="473">Q: So you did get a lot of hostility?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="476">Not a lot, but enough to make you realize that you were in an awkward <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="477">And it was a difficult --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: Excuse me --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: It was an awkward situation, after all.</sentence><sentence id="485">It was what everybody felt was a very just war.</sentence><sentence id="486">I felt the cause was just, I just didn't believe that war would ever answer it.</sentence><sentence id="487">And so that you are living in -- <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was in a pretty rough position from the beginning, the first few years.</sentence><sentence id="488">It was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="489">We had all sorts of, you know, military preparations fora possible invasion going on, so that kind of mindset.</sentence><sentence id="490">But I just went out and worked and did my job on the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">And in the meantime I had, as I said, registered with the Quakers that I was on their list of potential volunteers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="506">Q: Now, this was a list of volunteers who would go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p><p><sentence id="514">Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: Yeah, anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="516">You see, I actually signed up during the Spanish Civil War, I would be a volunteer and I was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, but the war ended before -- before I got an assignment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="521">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Um-hmm</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="523">A: And so then in 1944 they called me up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="525">Q: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="526">But somewhere along here you got married; is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="530">It was very important, 1942 I got married.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: So that was after you were working on the <span class="REGION">land</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="535">A: Yeah, after working on the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="545">Q: And that was while you were working on the <span class="REGION">land</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: Yeah, uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: But she was an assistant -- she was with the Quaker refugee effort?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="560">A: No, she was just with the children.</sentence><sentence id="564">. Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 12</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="572">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="583">A: But it was -- she volunteered to the Basque government when they were looking for teachers to go with the children.</sentence><sentence id="584">And when the -- the end of the Spanish Civil War, when that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was closed down, and some of the children went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and some went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where their parents were refugees, she became a teacher in an <span class="BUILDING">English nursery school</span>, in a <span class="BUILDING">wartime nursery</span> for children of mothers who were working in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="585">And this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span>.</sentence><sentence id="586">And just near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span> was the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Churchill tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="587">And there were a lot of women working there, so they had this <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> right by the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and she taught there.</sentence><sentence id="588">And so she was teaching there and I was working on the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="589">We -- at first we thought we would not get married till the war was over, but we had been engaged since 1939 or something, and by 1942 we decided why wait any longer, because there seemed to be no prospect the war was going to be over any quick moment.</sentence><sentence id="590">So we got married and I -- just after that in 1944, as I say, the Quakers got in touch with me and said they wanted me to come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to go to their <span class="BUILDING">training institute</span> to work for -- to join the team that was to go and work in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="591">And so I did, I left the job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guildford</span>.</sentence><sentence id="592">And this was an acceptable alternative under the laws which govern me being a conscientious objector, this was something I could do.</sentence><sentence id="593">And so I was .</sentence><sentence id="596">.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="628">Q: What was that like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="630">A: It was wonderful, because they did everything -- their objective was not to make you into a highly-skilled technician or anything like that, but to make you into a person who could cope with things without the usual facilities.</sentence><sentence id="631">So, I mean, they had the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">team</span> there were social workers and people like that.</sentence><sentence id="632">But the training was more to teach you how to cope with new situations.</sentence><sentence id="633">So they had a lot of, kind of, make-believe.</sentence><sentence id="634">We lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span> and they would -- one day they would decide that this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">refugee center</span> and that thousands of refugees were coming out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they had to be taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="635">So half the team would be the people looking after the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the other half of the team would be the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="636">And they were instructed to behave like people who are very desperate, who didn't trust anybody after their treatment in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so they wouldn't want to be registered, they wouldn't want to have their names taken.</sentence><sentence id="637">And our job was to learn to try and cope with them and, yes, it was -- it sounds a bit odd, but it was really very useful.</sentence><sentence id="638">Another day they -- they said, well, we just had an air raid and there is no -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is being destroyed and so we have got to make do.</sentence><sentence id="639">And so we were shoved out in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="640">And in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> there were just a few vegetables that have to be in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, and we were told to find a way of keeping ourselves alive for the day.</sentence><sentence id="641">We were told to dig up the potatoes and make some soup out of boxes because there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="642">And so it was this idea of being on your own, having to do things that you had never done before, and not running away from the job.</sentence><sentence id="643">And that certainly was very useful.</sentence><sentence id="647">.

Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 18 some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, going from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to this mid <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, which was just on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span>.</sentence><sentence id="889">But there they had set up a whole -- an arrangement for disinfecting and cleaning people up and so on.</sentence><sentence id="890">And then the other side of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> there were clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> which were going from the -- from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the new -- to the new establishment.</sentence><sentence id="891">So that there was a kind of an insulation between the diseases and the lice and everything that the people, that the camp inmates had, that were all washed off and disinfected and stripped of their clothing and wrapped in a clean blanket.</sentence><sentence id="892">And then the other end of the -- the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, they would be loaded into another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> which took them to the -- to this new <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="893">So you had one series of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> going between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of what they called the human laundry and another series of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> going from the laundry to the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="961">And so that was my first job, going in and helping get these children out of the -- out of the -- then because I was the truck driver in charge of the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="962">Well, one of the things, when we first arrived there, the authorities would not allow the girls, the female members of the team to enter the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="963">There were seven girls and five men.</sentence><sentence id="964">But the men were all assigned to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the girls were all assigned to work in the new, you know, <span class="BUILDING">reception center</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="982">Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 19</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="983">A: Well, I think to begin with, things were so -- when we first got there things were so unsettled in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="984">There were -- the SS guards were still there.</sentence><sentence id="985">They were being forced to help bury the dead, and the SS women were still there.</sentence><sentence id="986">And it was pretty rough kind of situation and I think that the people in authority felt that they didn't want to risk the girls going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="991">Q: For their physical safety or just what they would have to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="992">A: Well, I think probably it was such a -- it was -- it was such an outrageous situation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="994">Nobody, you know, people had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="995">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belson</span> was different.</sentence><sentence id="996"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belson</span> -- nobody really knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belson</span> until it was discovered because it had never been identified particularly as an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="997">So you had this peculiarly -- {beeping sound} -- turn that off -- had this peculiarly unsettled and unpleasant situation.</sentence><sentence id="998">And I guess the Army authorities in charge, they had the Army medical corps men working there, and in any case there were so many jobs to be done because what we were really doing was creating a new -- creating a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as we went along --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Um-hmm</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1000">A: -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="1001">Empty <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and so on were being furnished and all the supportive services that you have in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> were trying to be set up as quickly as possible to cope with the situation.</sentence><sentence id="1002">We -- a lot of the first things I think they did, we I think were the very first people, non Army people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1003">We went up -- there were six teams that were called in, I think five -- four Red Cross teams and one girls -- girl guides team, and the one Quaker team were called in in that very first appeal for immediate help.</sentence><sentence id="1004">But then soon after that they got a whole group of volunteer young medical students from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who .</sentence><sentence id="1007">. Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 20 came out.</sentence><sentence id="1008">But it was a -- it was the kind of thing to begin with when everybody was doing whatever immediately needed to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1009">There was not a highly organized and orderly procedure because you had the terrible pressure of the fact that while we were evacuating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I think another 15,000 died.</sentence><sentence id="1010">25,000 were -- were saved, were taken to the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1011">But it was very, very haphazard.</sentence><sentence id="1012">So, for example, after that first run in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>, I was sent off in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and told to find whatever I could that would be useful for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1013">Bed linen, towels.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1049">Q: Were the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> empty?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1051">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1052">The Germans had gone a long time -- well, not a long time ago, but had gone.</sentence><sentence id="1053">And so I used to go around picking up, getting all the bed linen, all the towels, all the kitchen utensils, anything that I could pick up in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and take it back to the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to help furnish it.</sentence><sentence id="1054">And then after that we discovered -- I think it was our team that discovered that there were around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a number of <span class="DLF">farms</span> which had vegetables, leeks, carrots and what have you, you know, just lying unharvested.</sentence><sentence id="1055">And so my job from then on was to go out every day and go around and scour around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and find out where there was a <span class="DLF">field</span> of leeks or <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span> and so on and get local -- I worked with a -- a German local fellow who helped me identify a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where -- a local inhabitant who knew the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1056">So he knew where the stuff were, and also he knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1060">.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1463">Q: I should say, how long did you get to sleep at night?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1465">A: Well, I guess we probably got to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> about ten o'clock, eleven o'clock at night.</sentence><sentence id="1466">But -- and, of course, it was an increasing deceleration as the -- each day there were less people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and each day therefore there were less crises in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">So it gradually got easier and easier.</sentence><sentence id="1468">But -- .</sentence><sentence id="1472">Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 28</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1511">A: Well, they were -- they were mostly reporting sessions because all of us were doing different things and quite often we didn't see each other during the day.</sentence><sentence id="1512">The girls were mostly working as like nurses or one of the girls was a cook -- not a cook -- a caterer and was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1513">And the -- we had one Jewish girl who was a very, very important member of the team.</sentence><sentence id="1514">She got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, frequented, before there was any kind of relaxation of the rules she got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because she was, obviously, terribly motivated to see exactly what was happening to her people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1515">And she used to wear a big copper Star of David or bronze Star of David on her uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1516">And when she went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wearing this, it was very, very impressive because for the camp inmates the Star of David was the kind of thing you had sewn on your sleeves or on your .</sentence><sentence id="1520">Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 29 back as something to be ashamed of.</sentence><sentence id="1521">And to see this girl wearing the Star of David as something to be proud of was -- meant a lot to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1649">Q: What was that like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1651">A: Well, it was -- it was very interesting because, see, it was a very difficult situation in some ways because the Poles consider themselves -- considered themselves the first fighters in the war.</sentence><sentence id="1652">They were the first <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> attacked by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And they, of course, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was very badly beaten up.</sentence><sentence id="1654">And the Germans were very bad to the Poles because they considered them kind of second-class citizens and brought them in for forced labor and so -- but when the war was over the Poles kind of felt, well, you know, they ought to be all considered heros because they were the ones who first started to fight the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1655">And so they used to get -- and they wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but they couldn't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because there was a problem inside <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as to who was going to govern the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1656">So they lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we -- we looked after them, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1657">We were the kind of town council -- like city government.</sentence><sentence id="1658">One was looking after <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, one was looking after clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1659">I was in charge of what was known as the camp commandant, and it was quite fun.</sentence><sentence id="1660">Well, fun isn't the word.</sentence><sentence id="1661">But it was very interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1689">Q: Mr. Jenkins, what are some of the reflections that you have on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belson camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1691">A: Well, the most obvious one, obviously, was its relationship to my being a conscientious objector.</sentence><sentence id="1692">I remember standing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> very early on and looking at the terrible -- and I guess the people who upset me most in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were the living because they -- the walking dead as it were.</sentence><sentence id="1693">They were so -- I mean, there were people who had gone <span class="NPIP">beyond</span> .</sentence><sentence id="1697">Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 32 the state of recovery.</sentence><sentence id="1698">The dead were dead and they were in peace.</sentence><sentence id="1699">But the -- and the ones who were -- the survivors were getting out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1700">But, in the meantime, there were these thousands of people dying.</sentence><sentence id="1701">And they were the people, I guess, who upset me most because you see them walking around, walking from nowhere to nowhere, and then they would just kind of fall down and there you were.</sentence><sentence id="1702">I remember thinking to myself, well, you know, while I was working on the <span class="REGION">land</span> and the sun was shining, but under this same <span class="DLF">sky</span> only relatively a few miles away, because <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> isn't all that far from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, these people were living under the same <span class="DLF">sky</span> and comparing the, you know, the fact that they were so hopeless and without any -- any hope of being saved or anything because, well, before the war ended, I mean, all the while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were going, they were going on for eternity, I mean, the people -- the Germans gave up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> only when the war was at their very <span class="DLF">doorstep</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1703">And so day after day these people were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and having to live under these terrible conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1704">And it made me think about being a conscientious objector and refusing to participate in the struggle.</sentence><sentence id="1705">And I thought about it a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="1706">The only thing I could -- the only conclusion I kept on coming to was that I still believed that war was not the answer.</sentence><sentence id="1707">That there must be some other answer.</sentence><sentence id="1708">And that eventually we had to get -- we had to get rid of war as a means of settling things.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And the only way we will do that is if -- hopefully the next generation there will be conscientious people that feel the same kind of mind and eventually come to a time where people will say we are not going to have an army, we are not going to have arms, there have to be other ways of settling our differences.</sentence><sentence id="1710">And that's -- may seem kind of high- minded theory, but on the other hand, that was as far as I got.</sentence><sentence id="1711">I couldn't believe, I couldn't persuade .</sentence><sentence id="1715">Interview with Hugh Montfort Jenkins 33 myself that I -- that it was wrong, that I should have been fighting instead, been in the army instead.</sentence><sentence id="1716">But --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1751">Q: And do you have some of those thoughts now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1753">A: No, except a sense of desolation when I see the way we seem to have -- still use war as a method of settling -- maybe that also has an argument in the fact that the third -- the Second World War didn't solve problems.</sentence><sentence id="1754">There are just as many problems in Europe, people fighting each other.</sentence><sentence id="1755">So, obviously, there must be some other way.</sentence><sentence id="1756">But whatever the way was, it was too late to save all the people who were victims of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1757">But that may be rationalizing it, but, no, I still think, I still believe that war is not -- never will be an answer to our problems.</sentence></p></dialogue>
