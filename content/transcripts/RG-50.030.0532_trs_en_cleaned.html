<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview conducted by Peggy Frankston, with Mrs. Lucie Ragin, on July 23", 2009, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, for the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial Museum.</sentence><sentence id="4">Good morning Mrs. Ragin.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">Interview with Lucie Ragin , July 23, 2009 we were very happy family and all of a sudden they said it wouldn't be good for the Jewish people to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> because the war was broke -- breaking out.</sentence><sentence id="8">So my parents and my aunt and uncle, we decided to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, and we packed whatever we could in a -- in a rush to leave, and -- for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">And I was a little girl, I really didn't understand too much.</sentence><sentence id="10">I saw people taping the <span class="DLF">window</span>, because they were afraid that their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> would be bombed, and they put tape on the <span class="DLF">window</span> so it wouldn't shatter.</sentence><sentence id="11">And we took a duffle bag, whatever we could, and we left by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">And I remember the Red Cross in the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Gare</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and they would help all the people and give them hot chocolate and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="13">And when they packed in a rush, one of the scissors that they packed was sticking up, and I sat on that bag, and I had to be treated by the Red Cross, and that's why I remember that incident.</sentence><sentence id="14">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on, and we really didn't know where we were going in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and we went towards this -- I guess on the -- the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and my aunt and uncle were with us, we were all i-in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brens(ph</span>), which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="15">And from there we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Recebedou</span>, or vice-versa.</sentence><sentence id="16">And then we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span>, which was the worst one, I think, of them all.</sentence><sentence id="17">I remember barbed wire, but I don't remember -- I think I was wearing a Jewish star, but I'm not positive.</sentence><sentence id="18">I was a little girl, and my mother was pregnant, and it was very hard for her because we didn't have any food, and we</sentence><sentence id="20">Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 didn't have many things.</sentence><sentence id="21">And whatever she had, she would give to her children.</sentence><sentence id="22">And I rem -- and my father in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, he's -- he knew -- he was a plumber there, they used him to do plumbing, and he helped people get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and they paid him by giving him like an egg, a tomato, a few potatoes and this way he would make his food.</sentence><sentence id="23">But they were aware of what he was doing, so he had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and not come back.</sentence><sentence id="24">He had to leave my mother and me there and not come back, because there were -- and every day they would come and they would pick up my mother, I don't know if it was the Vichy.</sentence><sentence id="25">I remember a German Shepherd also, and they would take my mother for questioning, because they thought she knew where he was, but she didn't.</sentence><sentence id="26">And I -- I used to see my cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="27">I don't remember about my uncle and my boy cousin.</sentence><sentence id="28">But we were very hungry, very, very hungry.</sentence><sentence id="29">There was hardly any food.</sentence><sentence id="30">I know my mother always said if you got like a hundred grams of bread and a little bit of turnip soup and if they punished you, they would take it away from you.</sentence><sentence id="31">That's what she said.</sentence><sentence id="32">And -- and she was always worried about everybody.</sentence><sentence id="33">And I remember in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they put me in the little <span class="BUILDING">children's nursery</span>, or whatever, and I would -- I was always crying -- they called me -- I was always crying, I was always sad, I was a very sad little girl because I always wanted to be with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="34">And I even had the German measles there, and they put me in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And I had the <span class="DLF">window</span> by -- I slept by the</sentence><sentence id="37">Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>, and there were other children there, and the mothers would come by the <span class="DLF">window</span> and they wanted to give things for their children, and I would -- I know I wasn't allowed to take it, but they like more or less forced me to do it.</sentence><sentence id="38">And then they took me away from by the <span class="DLF">window</span> so I couldn't see anybody.</sentence><sentence id="39">And we were there, and also I was in a little nursery where I cried all the time because I wanted to be with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="40">And one day I escaped when the milkman came, and I ho --I heard all the loudspeakers talking, you know, listening to my name, and -- and somehow I thought I would find my mother, but all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> looked alike, and I couldn't find her.</sentence><sentence id="41">So somebody recognized me and they took me to my mother and somehow she must have convinced them -- convinced them to let me stay there.</sentence><sentence id="42">And -- but I know everybody was very, very hungry, and there was a lot of suffering all around me.</sentence><sentence id="43">My girl cousin was very close to me and I would see her once in a while, but she was older and you know, they divided you by age.</sentence><sentence id="44">The rabbi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> heard that they were going to send everybody to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, so he told my mother to try to escape.</sentence><sentence id="45">My brother had -- and my father were no longer there.</sentence><sentence id="46">We didn't know where they were.</sentence><sentence id="47">You have to remember that in those days there was no radio, no communication from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="48">So you really didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="49">After the war we found out that my brother was given away to a French family.</sentence><sentence id="50">But the rabbi gave my mother a few francs and told</sentence><sentence id="52">Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 her to escape.</sentence><sentence id="53">So we had a pass to see my sister, who was born at the <span class="BUILDING">maternity</span> [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="54">And instead of going to see her, we escaped.</sentence><sentence id="55">And my mother had spoken to one of the nurses there and she said not to worry, that she's gonna try and get her out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">My mother was unbelievable, very strong lady, very strong, that she could survive all of this.</sentence><sentence id="57">And with a few francs we went -- we didn't go to see my sister, my mother took me to the <span class="BUILDING">La Gare</span>, which is the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">And she tried to buy tickets for us, she just had enough money to buy us tickets to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, she knew my father would be there.</sentence><sentence id="60">There was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where all the Jewish people stayed, and she figured somebody there would know where my father was.</sentence><sentence id="61">So -- but at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, I started to cry and she was afraid that the Germans would -- because you had to show a pass wherever you went, so she was afraid that the Germans would notice me crying, so she bought me soda.</sentence><sentence id="62">I wanted soda to keep me quiet.</sentence><sentence id="63">So when she went to buy the ticket, the money that she used for the soda, she didn't have enough for the tickets.</sentence><sentence id="64">So she met a woman there that she's a French lady, and she sold her -- she had a piece of soap, and she sold her the piece of soap and the lady and my mother bought the tickets and she took us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and spoke for my mother, cause my mother only spoke Yiddish and very little French, and they used to come on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to ask for identity.</sentence><sentence id="65">But my mother made believe like she was sleeping, and I was a little girl, I</sentence><sentence id="67">Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 spoke a little French, so that was all right, and the woman took care of me.</sentence><sentence id="68">But the minute we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, she -- she told my mother, I can no longer stay with -- with you, because -- she kissed us goodbye and she left us right there.</sentence><sentence id="69">So we didn't know really where to find my father, but we knew there was a place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Avant(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="70">I don't know exactly how she found that out, but we tried to go there and I was afraid of anybody that wore a uniform, so my mother was going to stop, she saw a mailman, and ask him.</sentence><sentence id="71">And I carried on so that she couldn't even ask him, but somehow she did after a while, and we found a place, <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Avant(ph</span>) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, where all the Jewish people were assembled.</sentence><sentence id="72">But it wasn't a very good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, because the Germans would come with big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they would raffle -- they would do a raffle at night and take everybody to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">So we were in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, it's like a miracle.</sentence><sentence id="74">My father's friend was there, and he said he hasn't seen my father for a while.</sentence><sentence id="75">Sometimes he comes in there, but he hasn't seen him for a while.</sentence><sentence id="76">But that night we went to sleep and my father cut his finger while he was -- he was a lumberjack during the war, in th -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, that's what he said.</sentence><sentence id="77">And he cut his finger, this finger here, the pointer.</sentence><sentence id="78">I always remember, because he had a big scar.</sentence><sentence id="79">And he had to see a doctor because the bleeding wouldn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="80">So he -- he came in to see the doctor and my father's friend said, you know, Mr. Zale, your wife and daughter are here.</sentence><sentence id="81">He said, come on, don't</sentence><sentence id="83">Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 joke around, it's impossible.</sentence><sentence id="84">So it just turned out that that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="85">So in the morning we saw my father and it was the most exciting time.</sentence><sentence id="86">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="87">And my father went to suture -- oh, my father went to the doctor to suture his wound, and my mother like almost collapsed because my brother wasn't with him.</sentence><sentence id="88">My brother and father, in the beginning they were like homeless people.</sentence><sentence id="89">But then my father saw that he couldn't take care of my brother, so he gave him away to a French fa-family.</sentence><sentence id="90">And they took very good care of him.</sentence><sentence id="91">So my mother said she's not leaving unless he gets my brother, so it took a -- well, we went to this vil -- little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> which is called Aix-en-Provence and from there we went with my father to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tres</span>, which was in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, where he was living.</sentence><sentence id="92">And the landlady, Madame Laville(ph), she was the landlady where my father lived, and she gave us a bigger <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and my broth -- my father got my brother back from the French people, and we all lived in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>: my mother, my father, my brother and me.</sentence><sentence id="93">And my sister was still at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erna(ph</span>).</sentence><sentence id="94">So the French lady was a wonderful, wonderful lady and she didn't like the Germans because they killed her son during the war, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="95">And she would take me with her all over.</sentence><sentence id="96">She would take me to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, she would take me to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">So she wanted to really baptize me.</sentence><sentence id="98">And she gave us like food, and she gave us -- and she let us live there all through the war without paying rent.</sentence><sentence id="99">We all lived in a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that looked like a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, all of us.</sentence><sentence id="100">And the Germans,</sentence><sentence id="102">Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 when they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, lived upstairs in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">And they didn't know we were Jewish, so that's another miracle.</sentence><sentence id="104">I mean, it's -- it's incredible.</sentence><sentence id="105">So we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> --and then, the Ozay(ph), or the Red Cross, the Swiss Red Cross got my sister out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> -- out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> and they brought her to us, to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="106">And my mother had to go to meet her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, and on the way back they didn't like her pass -- you know, they came to see, this one, to see if everything was all right, and they -- they almost didn't let her get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, because they didn't like the papers.</sentence><sentence id="107">It didn't have some kind of signature, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> driver said, come on, let's -- let her go, you know, and then he took off, and she came to Trespeux(ph) Giraud(ph), and we stayed there until liberation, but a lot of things happened in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">Sometimes they would come through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the Germans, and they said ammunition was -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> came by and dropped ammunition and whoever has it, they took the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, put them in the middle of this little <span class="DLF">park</span> and they said they're gonna shoot the priest if-- they're gonna shoot the priest if the ammunition is not found.</sentence><sentence id="109">But finally, after I don't know how many hours, they let us go.</sentence><sentence id="110">But we understood everything they said, because Yiddish and German is very similar.</sentence><sentence id="111">And also, in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we lived, this German soldier was talking to my mother, I don't know, in German, I guess, and he said, he doesn't know what's going to happen to him, he really doesn't want to be a</sentence><sentence id="113">Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 soldier, he might never see his kids again because you know, it's war.</sentence><sentence id="114">And he always used -- and he gave me a few candies.</sentence><sentence id="115">So I didn't know, we didn't let on that we were Jewish or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="116">And we lived in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we really were hungry too, we didn't have any food.</sentence><sentence id="117">And we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> for my sister, and inside there was like an <span class="DLF">opening</span> where she sat.</sentence><sentence id="118">So we would go into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and we would steal like potatoes and fruit.</sentence><sentence id="119">And my sister would sit -- we would put it in that <span class="DLF">opening</span> and my sister would sit right on top and that's how we would come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">And I would -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and my brother too, and my little sister stayed with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="121">And we had a very hard time, but all of a sudden they said that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> will be -- would be bombed.</sentence><sentence id="122">And so everybody went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and -- everybody went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> -- what I forgot to mention, I'll go back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> later, is that my -- th-the landlady, Madame Laville(ph) wanted to baptize me and my mother said no.</sentence><sentence id="123">Sh -- sh -- I was bor --- my daughter's born Jewish and she will die Jewish; because they were pretty religious before the war.</sentence><sentence id="124">So she didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="125">But she was always dressed in black because of the death of her son, and she had two little gi -- dogs, one white one and one black one.</sentence><sentence id="126">And she was very good to me, and to my whole family.</sentence><sentence id="127">But when we went up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, when they said they were gonna bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, that was almost at liberation, but we didn't know it.</sentence><sentence id="128">We saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going by, bombs falling,</sentence><sentence id="130">Interview with Lucie Ragin deg July 23, 2009 all kinds of things, and we stayed up there.</sentence><sentence id="131">And then all of a sudden they came and they told us that the war is over, we can go back.</sentence><sentence id="132">So everybody was so excited, but they didn't let the children go back because they weren't sure.</sentence><sentence id="133">So they said, let the grown-ups, some grown-ups go back and see if everything's all right.</sentence><sentence id="134">And then I remember liberation, it was great.</sentence><sentence id="135">All the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American tanks</span> came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and everybody was so happy, everybody was kissing everybody, they were drinking.</sentence><sentence id="136">And one day I was playing at a <span class="DLF">fountain</span> right there in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and an American soldier, who was a Zionist, I guess, he was looking for Jewish people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, if there were any Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="137">So I was playing with my friends and he came over and he said, which one of you little girls speaks Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="138">And I said, I do.</sentence><sentence id="139">And he says, take me to your mother.</sentence><sentence id="140">So my mother lived right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">So he -- he went to my mother, and my mother said she had a s-sister in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and he says, on my furlough, I'm gonna try and find out where -- if you -- if she's still alive, if she's interested and so on.</sentence><sentence id="142">So the next time he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, he brought my -- he heard from my aunt, he brought us goodies, and every American Jewish soldier that came through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and brought us things.</sentence><sentence id="143">And they -- they didn't know whether they were gonna make it because our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was the beginning of liberation, but they still had to go on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and -- and things like that, so they were a little bit -- some of</sentence><sentence id="145">Interview with Lucie Ragin 8 July 23, 2009 them were even crying to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="146">And from there we left nac -- we left that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, because we wanted to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to find out what happened to the rest of our family.</sentence><sentence id="147">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there with my brother and my sister, and they still had air raids where you had to go into the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> in the middle of the day.</sentence><sentence id="148">They still had all these things, and my father worked for the American army, and we saved up enough money and then we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">In 19 like "45, at the end of, and my -- and we had to find a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, it was very hard, you couldn't -- you couldn't find anything.</sentence><sentence id="150">And we found a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and -- and we lived there and every time people would come back <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">on buses</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to, that's wha -- they had like a <span class="DLF">country yard</span>, they would come back there and they would -- my mother would go to see if her sister, my uncle, my aunt, my -- my cousins were alive, and nobody ever came back.</sentence><sentence id="151">And she would never walk in that <span class="DLF">street</span> ever again, she would go all around.</sentence><sentence id="152">And we -- I forgot to mention that also, when I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, I was in <span class="BUILDING">children's homes</span>, I was in <span class="BUILDING">Villa Marianne</span>, which is in south Raphael, and I was very hungry there too, I used to eat the peels from the garbage when we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">I hated it.</sentence><sentence id="154">First of all, I wanted to be with my mother and father, and we would go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and I-I didn't like it because they made you bathe without a bathing suit.</sentence><sentence id="155">They kept you very badly, and the</sentence><sentence id="157">Interview with Lucie Ragin " July 23, 2009 [indecipherable] priest who was the one in charge, he made parties, and we didn't have any food, and some of the boys at night would go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, they made believe like they were sl-sleepwalking, and bring food for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="158">And life is strange, I'm -- I'm just doing this, I'm gonna f-- I'm just doing this -- I always talk about the Holocaust because I don't want people to

for Christmas because the children always got a lot of toys to play with, and -- but I said I was so good, why didn't I get such a big doll, or why didn't I get these things.</sentence><sentence id="333">So -- because I didn't understand, so my mother always used to say, oh, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="334">And one day Madame Laville(ph) bought me a lot of toys, so -- cause I waited for Santa Claus just like anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="335">And also, I loved going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my mother sewed, so she sometimes would make me clothes and she would knit a whole night sometimes to make me a pair of socks.</sentence><sentence id="336">Sh-she -- and I didn't have the things, the material things like other kids, but I wasn't really that
