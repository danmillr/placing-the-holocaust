<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, on the 14th of July, 1923.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My family were German as far as we can research it back into the 1800s in the even before 1800.</sentence><sentence id="10">We were all Germans.</sentence><sentence id="11">My mother came from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luthenbeck</span>, which is on the <span class="RIVER">River Main</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">Uh...I know that my grandfather dealt in collecting fat to make soap.</sentence><sentence id="13">We're going back into the 1800s.</sentence><sentence id="14">And my father, named Leopold...uh...was born near, which is a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...uh...the <span class="REGION">area</span> is called.</sentence><sentence id="15">And his father dealt in animals.</sentence><sentence id="16">He was a trader of animals.</sentence><sentence id="17">My father...uh...grew up and was sent into an apprenticeship... uh...at a merchant, and he became a merchant, eventually specializing in the sale of specialty oils.</sentence><sentence id="18">He had a very interesting patent as a matter of fact, a patent where he...he was the sole distributor of that particular oil, made it possible to wash out lubricating oils which would spill from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">weaving looms</span> from bearings where it should lubricate, on to the fabric.</sentence><sentence id="19">And that made secondhand fabric which the <span class="BUILDING">cloth manufacturers</span> could not sell.</sentence><sentence id="20">And his oil was the only oil in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that could be washed out, a washable lubricant.</sentence><sentence id="21">And with it, he became extremely successful.</sentence><sentence id="22">Uh...My father at age 19 lost his right leg in World War I, and because of that he had received one of the early <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> as a war veteran.</sentence><sentence id="23">There was no anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="24">He was just a veteran and he very proudly all these years until the...1936-38 wore his...you know the iron cross on his lapel with great pride every day.</sentence><sentence id="25">He wouldn't go out without his decorations because he was very, very German.</sentence><sentence id="26">We were...like I am an American today with knowing what I have, we...our family, including myself, were very German.</sentence><sentence id="27">We routed for the German team to win in the Olympics except maybe I'm jumping the gun a little bit, but it's interesting because in 1936 when Jesse Owens, the American sprinter, won several races.</sentence><sentence id="28">I don't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="29">At that time I was 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="30">Uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> said the black man is not a human being.</sentence><sentence id="31">They're more...or closer to animals and that's why he win and that's why he beat the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="32">That gave me an awful shock even though I knew what anti-Semitism was but...uh...but the fact that Hitler declared the black people animals, even as a young kid already, I smelled something that was very distasteful, and I stopped routing for the Germans and when I stopped routing for the Americans...Germans, and I started routing for the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="33">An interesting psychological thing that happened in 36.</sentence><sentence id="34">Well..uh...my</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Tell me...tell me.. tell me a little bit about your siblings.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="64">Uh...I had a sister, Marion, which is 8 years younger than I am....uh...born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> also.</sentence><sentence id="65">We had a very comfortable income.</sentence><sentence id="66">My father was one of the highest tax</sentence><sentence id="68">payers connected to you name it from the highest officials in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> down to...uh...being a...uh..executive...not executive director...on the executive board of the, which later came to haunt him because when he was arrested in 1939, he was arrested because his name was on this roster.</sentence><sentence id="69">Uh...My sister, Marion, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the 30s.</sentence><sentence id="70">Went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> until...[ am not totally sure about the date, but I think 1933, 1934, all Jews were expelled from <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">We felt fairly comfortable in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> except, and that is interesting that the Jewish kids automatically sat together.</sentence><sentence id="72">Don't ask me how we found each other.</sentence><sentence id="73">Now we were...we were 6, 7, 8, 10 year olds.</sentence><sentence id="74">The Jewish kids automatically felt they ought to protect themselves.</sentence><sentence id="75">They ought to sit together.</sentence><sentence id="76">We always sit together.</sentence><sentence id="77">And nobody told me who was Jewish and who was not.</sentence><sentence id="78">But until 33, 34, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> was fairly comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="79">My father and my mother, like all Jewish parents, tried to shield the kids from the reality.</sentence><sentence id="80">Uh...We knew that certain things were going on.</sentence><sentence id="81">I know that and I remember distinctly where there were <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where said, Juden.</sentence><sentence id="82">That means "No Jews.</sentence><sentence id="83">Don't buy here."</sentence><sentence id="84">And I know there were often signs on <span class="DLF">windows</span>, bands on <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, "Don't.</sentence><sentence id="85">You Jews cannot buy here".</sentence><sentence id="86">There were discriminations, but our parents didn't want us kids to know or suffer from it.</sentence><sentence id="87">So we bought our clothes some other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">There were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish warehouses</span>, and we went and bought there.</sentence><sentence id="89">But as times went on...until 1936, things were fairly under cover.</sentence><sentence id="90">I mean they happened, but I know that more from historical facts than from personal experience.</sentence><sentence id="91">But after the Olympics, and after Hitler put on a good show and because the world came to the Olympics in 36...after 36 things drastically changed.</sentence><sentence id="92">Whether that was or the Nuremberg laws or whatever that was...you couldn't go to a dentist or any other doctor any more, and...uh...Jewish professionals were prohibited from practicing and from occupying certain... uh...occupations, certain...uh...trades.</sentence><sentence id="93">We felt that it was becoming increasingly difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How...how do you...how did the Nuremberg laws affect you personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Uh...Me personally, directly, they only affected us because...I'm not sure whether it was the Nuremberg law or not, but we had to call ourselves...the boys...Martin Israel Strauss, add the name <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and my sister and my mother Sarah.</sentence><sentence id="130">I remember one incident probably about 1938 or 1939 where I was on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and I made a wrong turn of some kind and a policeman came and said, "Who are you?"</sentence><sentence id="131">And I said, "Martin Strauss."</sentence><sentence id="132">And he said, "Martin Israel Strauss."</sentence><sentence id="133">And I said, "Yes, Sir."</sentence><sentence id="134">The identification by saying <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> (coughing...excuse me please) was...uh...it didn't say <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, it said Jew Strauss.</sentence><sentence id="135">Martin Jew Strauss.</sentence><sentence id="136">That's what <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> said.</sentence><sentence id="137">And of course I was guilty and I got a...a...a fine payable at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and...uh...I'm sure everybody else would have gotten away with it, but the minute it was Martin Israel Strauss, you were guilty no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="138">Uh...And of course, then in 38...let's go back to 36...I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="139">Uh...<span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> no longer admitted us, or we were thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> created <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span>, Jewish teachers, Jewish learning.</sentence><sentence id="141">And we found that very comfortable, us kids, simply because we were not harassed.</sentence><sentence id="142">We were not exposed to the...to the gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="143">We played football with them and me being a good football at one time created a Hell of a fight.</sentence><sentence id="144">Because one party wanted me as a good football player, and the other party said, "We're not playing with any Jews."</sentence><sentence id="145">So a big fight erupted between the two football teams because the Jew Strauss was going to be on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">team</span> and they didn't want him on that</sentence><sentence id="147">team.</sentence><sentence id="148">Uh... These things as kids...13, 14, 15 years...leave an impression, but they don't bother you.</sentence><sentence id="149">It was more important to play football, than it was the racial incident.</sentence><sentence id="150">And that's how we slowly became accustomed to being...let's say...inferior people but living with it.</sentence><sentence id="151">It's a system.</sentence><sentence id="152">But then many of my father's friends, Thank God, lost their occupation and couldn't practice any more and that gave them an impetus to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, thusly saving their lives.</sentence><sentence id="153">But my father and many others was quite wealthy, very wealthy indeed, and he said, "Hitler is going to go away.</sentence><sentence id="154">We're going to wait.</sentence><sentence id="155">Even if I cannot sell...sell my oil to many people who would not buy from me, there is still some big concerns who want to buy from me because I have something very special."</sentence><sentence id="156">And he said, "We will overcome and we will last longer than this nut, Hitler, will."</sentence><sentence id="157">And thusly we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="158">My father being the patriot of the family....he had 8 brothers and sisters, followed his example even though they were not that well off, but they were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were farmers and they were animal...uh...breeders.</sentence><sentence id="159">They had enough to eat, and they were living off the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and they didn't need much.</sentence><sentence id="160">They said, "If Leopold Strauss doesn't leave, I don't have to leave either."</sentence><sentence id="161">And I am ashamed and with great sorrow, I must say that my father to his dying day had nightmares of guilt of not having sent his 8 brothers and sisters, their families and their children out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">Meaning they all perished.</sentence><sentence id="163">There are 24, maybe 26.</sentence><sentence id="164">We are not totally sure.</sentence><sentence id="165">But 24 confirmed people who died in the Holocaust because they could not leave after it was too late, meaning 1939.</sentence><sentence id="166">Uh...We have confirmation of various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where they perished.</sentence><sentence id="167">They were 8 brothers and sisters, their respective spouses, and their children amounting to a minimum of 24 people.</sentence><sentence id="168">They are all confirmed.</sentence><sentence id="169">That's on my father's side.</sentence><sentence id="170">On my mother's side, many of them escaped because they were smart enough to leave.</sentence><sentence id="171">From 36 to 39, which is a...uh...period of strengthening, growing anti- Semitism, growing laws, growing persecution...uh...they took away <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">You could not own a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> anymore even though I will admit my father was the only one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> who had permission to have an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> because (a) he had lost his leg in World War I. He was a decorated veteran.</sentence><sentence id="173">He had connections to <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>, and he was permitted to keep an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span>, the only one in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of large proportions.</sentence><sentence id="174">Everybody else had to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>, provided he stands up.</sentence><sentence id="175">You could not sit down in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">Of course, that leads to little shoving matches, shouting matches...uh...but we got used to it.</sentence><sentence id="177">It's a condition that...that's so unbelievable where the human dignity has been taken away from each individual.</sentence><sentence id="178">A little chip at a time until the time came that you had to walk on the side walk and you couldn't walk on the...on the...you had to walk in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> because you couldn't walk on the side...<span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">And...uh...a little chip at a time until you're just totally dehumanized and become nothing.</sentence><sentence id="180">But it happens step by step.</sentence><sentence id="181">It isn't a process that happens over night, and if I may inject a little bit of personal thoughts on this, the German people also were conditioned toward the anti-Semitism, toward hitting the people, and they weren't all anti-Semites at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="182">They were taught to be anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="183">There were newspapers, the Sturmer, which is...I am sure we still have records of these, that had propaganda that even we, as children, laughed about.</sentence><sentence id="184">But many grownups took it as...as the truth.</sentence><sentence id="185">And I...I still remember about Passover where they accused Jews of slaughtering little Gentiles...kids...excuse me a second please.</sentence><sentence id="186">You can edit it out.</sentence><sentence id="187">Uh...Where the the Sturmer, the newspaper showed Jews killing kids for Pass...for Passover.</sentence><sentence id="188">We laughed about it.</sentence><sentence id="189">But I am sure that many other people took it serious and accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="190">So life was tolerable because we had enough funds, and lucky</sentence><sentence id="192">we...those that didn't have any funds tried to get out.</sentence><sentence id="193">All ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">And we're getting...I'm sure there...there are many other periods in between, but right now I go to Kristallnacht which...uh...I want to retrench then for a second.</sentence><sentence id="195">Uh...We had our <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and we felt very comfortable because we were together and nobody harassed us when we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and we had a lot of Jewish teachers and we studied religion where we could, but we also had a lot of Polish Jewish teachers.</sentence><sentence id="196">And there came a day...I don't know the exact date...where suddenly all Polish Jews were rounded up by Hitler and his associates, put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and shoved back into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">That day I remember quite clearly.</sentence><sentence id="198">We lost many of our teachers.</sentence><sentence id="199">One thing we lost our English teacher.</sentence><sentence id="200">I remember we lost our Math teacher, the two primary...uh...sources of knowledge, and I remember distinctly the day when it happened.</sentence><sentence id="201">The teachers were rounded up, put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and shoved out.</sentence><sentence id="202">My teacher...uh...asked me to please go to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and fetch a little suitcase.</sentence><sentence id="203">We were very close to the teacher.</sentence><sentence id="204">She was often at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which is the custom you know.</sentence><sentence id="205">The teacher is the honored person in a...was the honored person, was always taken in Friday night dinners and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="206">Any how...uh...I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">teacher's house</span> and got a little suitcase and threw it over a <span class="DLF">fence</span> to her prior to her getting on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">And I was <span class="DLF">school yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">I fetched her little valise with some stuff that she told me to bring, threw it over the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and she had it.</sentence><sentence id="209">Whatever it meant.</sentence><sentence id="210">It was totally meaningless, but one of those acts of desperation and...uh...she went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">Somehow, it is interesting to note she escaped...uh...out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, became teacher in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">It was a miracle happened.</sentence><sentence id="213">How she got out I...I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="214">In any event, we lost a great deal of our teaching staff, and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after that was not any more because there were substitute teachers.</sentence><sentence id="215">They were lay...lay teachers.</sentence><sentence id="216">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> didn't function like it should.</sentence><sentence id="217">Uh... Things got worse and...and harassment was...were on the increase, but our parents shielded us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: You mentioned that before...you told me...why don't you tell me a little bit about your Bar Mitzvah, and your Jewish education.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="314">Uh...Of course, like most German Jews (coughing) Forgive me...uh...we came from a fairly <span class="BUILDING">orthodox house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">Uh...When Hitler decreed in 1934 or thereabouts...the date may not be accurate...that no more kosher slaughtering was allowed, my mother had to make a choice.</sentence><sentence id="316">Either we eat non-kosher food or we don't eat meat, and of course, the decision was made "no more meat in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="317">And my mother would keep it absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="318">Nothing doing.</sentence><sentence id="319">No meat.</sentence><sentence id="320">So we became vegetarians.</sentence><sentence id="321">Again one of those conditions steps.</sentence><sentence id="322">It's not difficult to...to forego meat when it is not available, but you have enough to eat.</sentence><sentence id="323">It was just one more of those steps that...but with the proper resolve, my mother insisted that we do not break the laws of kosher.</sentence><sentence id="324">And the reason I remember this...because of my Bar Mitzvah in 1936...uh...we invited a number of friends.</sentence><sentence id="325">My father was still well known in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and one of the biggest events of that Bar Mitzvah was that the menu included kosher meat.</sentence><sentence id="326">Where do you get kosher meat?</sentence><sentence id="327">You fly...not fly it, you truck it.</sentence><sentence id="328">I guess they...they didn't fly it...from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where there was kosher slaughtering, and they trucked the meat for the Bar Mitzvah at tremendous cost because of freezing refrigeration was almost not heard of in those days.</sentence><sentence id="329">That means it had to be slaughtered today, trucked tomorrow, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> to the Bar Mitzvah and a big...I'm not sure that the kosher meat</sentence><sentence id="331">wasn't more of an attraction than my Bar Mitzvah, but it was one of those memorable affairs where we had one up on the...uh...on the...let's day...Nazis who would not allow us to have kosher meat.</sentence><sentence id="332">And the Bar Mitzvah, of course, was well attended by all the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="333">Many of our Gentile friends in the upper echelon would not attend, but would send gifts.</sentence><sentence id="334">Again, one of those conditioning affairs.</sentence><sentence id="335">We understand you cannot attend for political reasons, but we accept that.</sentence><sentence id="336">Uh...Going back to 1939, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very difficult and one day, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is burning.</sentence><sentence id="337">I go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="338">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is burning, and I didn't understand it because there were no fire engines and people were standing around.</sentence><sentence id="339">No explanation.</sentence><sentence id="340">My father is looking for me, and my mother is looking for me and when I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, they are delighted that I'm okay.</sentence><sentence id="341">What I didn't know is that Kristallnacht was about to happen.</sentence><sentence id="342">It didn't happen yet.</sentence><sentence id="343">Uh...During Kristallnacht, of course, we are aware that all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, including ours, the <span class="BUILDING">Reform Synagogue</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox Synagogue</span>, were burned.</sentence><sentence id="344">Some people who went in to save some of the scrolls were killed.</sentence><sentence id="345">Uh...Furniture came flying...during the night came flying out <span class="DLF">windows</span>, that the word Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="346">Uh..People, not in uniform, but in civilian clothes...1 remember that distinctly because normally the SR, SS were proud to wear the uniforms...but when when it came to looting stores and when it came to throwing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out and robbing <span class="BUILDING">households</span> and beating up people, most of these...as a matter of fact, I don't remember any incident where they were in...they were in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="347">They were all in civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="348">And...uh...we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and closed ourselves in, meaning we wouldn't open the <span class="DLF">door</span> for anybody.</sentence><sentence id="349">We would just wait it out sort of.</sentence><sentence id="350">Well, at...at night around midnight, maybe 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">Solid knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">And three people, civilian clothes again, pressed pass my mother into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and said, "Where is Mr.
