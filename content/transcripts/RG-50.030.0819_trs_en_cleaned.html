the <span class="DLF">lines</span> are.</sentence><sentence id="2337">So, that's what we started out to do.</sentence><sentence id="2338">So, we're in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, it's now -- the vision is not very clear, it's an overcast sky.</sentence><sentence id="2339">I remember driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, the <span class="DLF">roads</span> are covered with i -- snow and ice.</sentence><sentence id="2340">We round a curve, and just about -- maybe about 10 to 15 yards ahead of me, there's a German 88 millimeter cannon pointed right at the <span

so, you know, anybody pulled that trigger, we were gone.</sentence><sentence id="2343">And I can talk, and I do talk man --many, many times, the number of times that you are exposed to killing, to being killed, and that was -- that was one of them, and there were many, many others.</sentence><sentence id="2344">So it's, you know, miracles take place, and you don't get killed.</sentence><sentence id="2345">But that was one that they certainly -- somebody should have pulled the trigger, and we would have been gone.</sentence><sentence id="2346">They didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2347">I jammed on the brakes, we skidded off the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2348">All of a sudden, fire from rifles -- apparently mi -- rifles and machine-guns, small arm fire, is pouring in from our right.</sentence><sentence id="2349">And we -- none of us were hit immediately.</sentence><sentence id="2350">I--I say, we Interview with Robert Max 0 July 14, 2015 have to -- we have to defend ourselves yet.</sentence><sentence id="2351">Have to find something, we can't do it from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="2352">We see a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> across the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and I say, we move toward that <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2353">We did.</sentence><sentence id="2354">One of the men had the perception to real-realize, we go near the machine-gun -- some -- somebody's firing a lot of -- lot of ri-rifle fire at us, or machine-gun fire.</sentence><sentence id="2355">So he too -- he detached the one from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, and brought that with us.</sentence><sentence id="2356">So we start racing for the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2357">One of our men is hit and killed on the way over.</sentence><sentence id="2358">We get to the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, and the enemy fire is still pouring in.</sentence><sentence id="2359">We have to set up the machine-gun, some way, to fire back.</sentence><sentence id="2360">And so there's a big <span class="DLF">bay window</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2361">The man who took the machine-gun, I think it was him, he sets it up in the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and he starts firing.</sentence><sentence id="2362">Within maybe a minute or so, he's hit, and he's -- he's killed.</sentence><sentence id="2363">When I talk to student groups, I-- I say sometimes people -- un-understand, you do things under battlefield conditions, you do things you would not normally do, because you do it on your instinct.</sentence><sentence id="2364">Something tells you that you have to take -- you have to do something right now.</sentence><sentence id="2365">So, my instinct, without thinking about the consequences, I was wide open, I would be killed just like the other man was, your instinct is a-- is a--jump behind that gun.</sentence><sentence id="2366">Which is what I did, and I started firing.</sentence><sentence id="2367">And I fired the machine gun at everything I saw move.</sentence><sentence id="2368">I hit some, probably killed a number of their men.</sentence><sentence id="2369">And that went on -- that had started early in the morning -- that went on until late in the afternoon, we're running out of fire.</sentence><sentence id="2370">We didn't -- we had no Interview with Robert Max ia July 14, 2015 idea what we were against, at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2371">I learned later on that there were at least a hundred -- somewhere between a hundred and 200 si -- over there, dug in, in <span class="DLF">foxholes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2372">And we were -- we started out with six of us, one was killed immediately, so there were five of us, fighting them, and for a good part of the day.</sentence><sentence id="2373">That machine-gun really kept us going.</sentence><sentence id="2374">When we ran low on ammunition, we had to devise some strategy, how do we get out of this?</sentence><sentence id="2375">We had two wounded.</sentence><sentence id="2376">There was another <span class="DLF">window</span>, so two a-- two of them were hit.</sentence><sentence id="2377">I-- I looked, and I saw a <span class="DLF">trap door</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, meaning there must be a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> beneath.</sentence><sentence id="2378">So the strategy was simply this; we had to make them believe that they killed us off, or that we -- we -- we took off toward our -- our rank, toward our -- our la -- our American and our <span class="DLF">British lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2379">And so, I figure, we'll climb down into this <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, and then when it's dark, under cover of darkness, we'll emerge.</sentence><sentence id="2380">If we can take those two wounded, we will certainly do that, we certainly wanted to do that.</sentence><sentence id="2381">And we -- so that was the -- that was the idea.</sentence><sentence id="2382">We would infiltrate through their <span class="DLF">lines</span> at night, under cover of darkness, we possibly could do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2453">Q: So there were two of you who were not wounded yet?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2455">A: Ah, well there were -- we started out with six, five me -- six, one was hit.</sentence><sentence id="2456">So there were five of us.</sentence><sentence id="2457">So there -- there were two wounded, and three able-bodied.</sentence><sentence id="2458">So we -- that wa -- that was the strategy, then we would come out and make our way back</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2459">through the <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2460">Because we had no ammunition, we absolutely ran out of a- ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="2461">Of about -- I -- I don't know, it was about a half hour or so -- no way to measure time, but I figured somewhere around there, I push open that <span class="DLF">trap door</span>, maybe we could come out now, maybe it's dark now, and what I saw -- and I always tell people when I -- when I talk to them, there's some things in battle, in combat, or captivity, that you don't remember, that you block out, and some of them are blocked out of your mind.</sentence><sentence id="2462">Either you don't ca -- you don't remember them, or you don't want to remember them.</sentence><sentence id="2463">Some that you have a vague re -- recollection of, and others that remain visible to you, perhaps for the rest of your life, as this one does today.</sentence><sentence id="2464">So as I stand before you now, I can tell you, I see that rim of black, automatic guns, all pointed down, right at my face.</sentence><sentence id="2465">And behind each of those guns is a white- cloaked, camouflaged German soldier, holding that gun, trigger finger poised, ready to fire at any moment.
