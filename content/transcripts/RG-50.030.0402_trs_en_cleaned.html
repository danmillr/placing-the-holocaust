<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Can you tell us some about your father?</sentence><sentence id="342">A-A-A-Again, during this pre-Hitler time, before a lot of anxiety had come about for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Well, my father was very well known.</sentence><sentence id="346">He wrote a column for the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span> about anything new in laws.</sentence><sentence id="347">When the laws was the -- not Hitler law, he had a reserved column, whenever he wanted to write.</sentence><sentence id="348">He had the clients from here to there, very important cases.</sentence><sentence id="349">He was a very charming man, and a very good speaker.</sentence><sentence id="350">So he would tell socially anecdote about all the doctors and lawyers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">He was very well known at the -- by the judges.</sentence><sentence id="352">His word counted.</sentence><sentence id="353">I don't know if I should tell you one case that's really -- by that time Hitler was [indecipherable]</sentence><sentence id="355">already.</sentence><sentence id="356">There was a couple, an Austrian woman and a German man, and the laws were that -- I have to get this -- they wanted to get married.</sentence><sentence id="357">And the laws are, you have to go by the marriage laws of your home country.</sentence><sentence id="358">The woman was Austrian and Catholic, and couldn't divorce and marry that man.</sentence><sentence id="359">So they had many cases, I mean, they tried it, no.</sentence><sentence id="360">Then my father got the case, and my father, as a Jew said, I think I have an angle.</sentence><sentence id="361">It is important to the German country to have strong German children.</sentence><sentence id="362">If you keep that woman from marrying the man, having children, then it is against the national interest and the Austrian law should not apply.</sentence><sentence id="363">My father won the case.</sentence><sentence id="364">The judge said, "As a Jew, you really made a case."</sentence><sentence id="365">My father said, "I'm a lawyer."</sentence><sentence id="366">The joke was, she was over 45.</sentence><sentence id="367">No children.</sentence><sentence id="368">It's just one of the stories that I remember.</sentence><sentence id="369">But I mean, he had an angle.</sentence><sentence id="370">He knew what -- and it -- he wasn't sarcastic, he had a client and he worked for it.</sentence><sentence id="371">He also said -- and that is very different from lawyers here, for every marriage, divorce, he reunited half the people.</sentence><sentence id="372">He said it is not right to take money if you can protect a life.</sentence><sentence id="373">Another thing I remember from my father as a young lawyer, he worked -- he was associated with a much older man.</sentence><sentence id="374">They went for a com -- how shall I say?</sentence><sentence id="375">It was -- it [indecipherable] of a contract they were working on.</sentence><sentence id="376">They spent five hours on that.</sentence><sentence id="377">Eventually they hashed it out.</sentence><sentence id="378">My father and his mentor went back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="379">The older man opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span>, took out the contract which was almost exactly what they came to.</sentence><sentence id="380">He had written that before.</sentence><sentence id="381">And he said to my father, when you argue with people, or have a contract with them, you've got to remember their point of view.</sentence><sentence id="382">You don't say it in the beginning, but you have to know how far you can come to make them meet.</sentence><sentence id="383">I wish they had it now in a few <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">So, I mean, my father had a very solid background, but my mother said she used to go to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> when he was pleading, sit in the back and monitor it.</sentence><sentence id="385">She would tell him what the reaction was of the people, also whether his voice carried.</sentence><sentence id="386">I was too young.</sentence><sentence id="387">I would have loved to go because I was always fascinated by the law,</sentence><sentence id="389">and as a kid I was reading all his law books.</sentence><sentence id="390">Some of them weren't so kosher.</sentence><sentence id="391">I mean, some of them had things there that [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="392">So I learned a lot.</sentence><sentence id="393">I used to tell the other kids what was going on, you know, things that nowadays you read it in every book, but in those days -- my parents didn't mind.</sentence><sentence id="394">They always felt that what I can learn, okay.</sentence><sentence id="395">As a matter of fact, I had a reputation.</sentence><sentence id="396">My mother used to say -- and then 40 years later the people in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> said it, you cannot keep secrets from Ruth.</sentence><sentence id="397">My mother said to my father, "If -- she will always find out and tell everybody.</sentence><sentence id="398">But if you tell her it's a secret, she not say peep."</sentence><sentence id="399">And that was from when I was 12 til 1 was 80.</sentence><sentence id="400">Well, it was funny.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="BUILDING">Rowan house</span> for one week.</sentence><sentence id="2218">And my father [indecipherable] got sick.</sentence><sentence id="2219">My mother asked if we could stay longer, they said no.</sentence><sentence id="2220">They probably thought we were just telling them.</sentence><sentence id="2221">In the meantime we found out that my uncle from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and we found out where he was.</sentence><sentence id="2222">And we went -- he was in what you call a brownstone, I don't know what they have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they have the refurnished <span

class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but she had no other <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, she said she would in two weeks, and my sister and I were in</sentence><sentence id="2225">3 another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that belonged to her, under the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2226">It was slanted <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and there we were, and what impressed me was, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>, where in daylight, it was pitch dark and in 15 minutes was bright sunshine.</sentence><sentence id="2227">That was near the equator.</sentence><sentence id="2228">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, dawn and dusk were [indecipherable] especially during the war when they had daylight saving, you could read at 11 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="2229">I like that.</sentence><sentence id="2230">So there we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and after a month, I got a job doing millinery work.</sentence><sentence id="2231">I put labels into the hat, by appointment to her majesty the queen.</sentence><sentence id="2232">I'm sure she never wore my hat.</sentence><sentence id="2233">I wasn't very good at it.</sentence><sentence id="2234">And then came the war, September "39 [indecipherable] arrived in June.[indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2235">By August we knew.</sentence><sentence id="2236">I went sightseeing on Saturday after work, but most of the things were buried already for safekeeping.</sentence><sentence id="2237">Children were taken away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2238">Things were getting ready, but not as ready as they should have.</sentence><sentence id="2239">When the war started, I was working in that <span class="BUILDING">millinery</span>, and one of the girls said, did you know that trouble had started?</sentence><sentence id="2240">And I said, trouble, does that mean war?</sentence><sentence id="2241">She says, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2242">So in those let -- last few days the ambassadors went back and forth, but then it was war.</sentence><sentence id="2243">They called it the blitzkrieg, they thought the Germans would come like this, which didn't happen, and they made fun of it and called it the sitzkrieg, they were sitting.</sentence><sentence id="2244">But by April -- my <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> kicked me out, they weren't busy any more and me he could do without.</sentence><sentence id="2245">And in the spring, of course, Hitler ran over <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2246">And at that time, the English were afraid that among the refugees there would be Nazis hiding as refugee, and all -- most of the men were put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, my father, and everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2247">So he was -- I think it was the Isle of Mann where he was, from June, July, August, September, three month.</sentence><sentence id="2248">In the meantime the blitz had started.</sentence><sentence id="2249">Every night the bombs came down when it got dark until it got daylight.</sentence><sentence id="2250">And of course as the la -- nights got longer, the bombs went.</sentence><sentence id="2251">We -- I know we were -- one time we were standing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, sitting there, and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was shaking, and I was thinking, I hope the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> will stay up.</sentence><sentence id="2252">If the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> stays up we'll be alright.</sentence><sentence id="2253">Then, after the all</sentence><sentence id="2255">4 clear, you went around looking what <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> weren't there.</sentence><sentence id="2256">And my father came back in September, and he managed to get passage for us to come to the State, which was very hard to get.</sentence><sentence id="2257">I mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were being sunk, and they needed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2258">So we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> and went on board.</sentence><sentence id="2259">Blackout.</sentence><sentence id="2260">You couldn't go on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> with [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">doors</span>, because you know, you couldn't even smoke on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> because a light carries very far in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2261">We had air raid alarms.</sentence><sentence id="2262">Mostly they were just tests, but sometimes you could hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, and you didn't really know where, what.</sentence><sentence id="2263">So we went -- I think it took about more than two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2264">There were three groups of people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2265">Children with their mothers or their nannies, that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> for safekeeping.</sentence><sentence id="2266">And some refugees, and a whole batch of young men who just came on board.</sentence><sentence id="2267">No paper, no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2268">Well, what we find out, we were full -- I think two full crews for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>, which Roosevelt had promised Churchill cash and carry.</sentence><sentence id="2269">They picked up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and take them back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2270">So, I remember one thing, everything was blackout and no -- no identification.</sentence><sentence id="2271">And when we were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span>, there was a fog and an old English man said, well, when the king and queen came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span>, they were befogged too, so it's all right.</sentence><sentence id="2272">And I was standing on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> with some guy and we saw the captain come out.</sentence><sentence id="2273">We hadn't seen him before, because I mean, it was a heck of a job getting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> over.</sentence><sentence id="2274">And he was looking up and saluting, and we saw it was the Union Jack wave, and that meant we were in <span class="REGION">Canadian waters</span>, and we'd done it.</sentence><sentence id="2275">Now that moment I will never forget, because on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, you [indecipherable] you never got undressed.</sentence><sentence id="2276">You had your lifebelt, you had your winter coat, and your boots.</sentence><sentence id="2277">You had to have the winter coat in case you went into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2278">You had to be able to throw it off in case you went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2279">Same thing with the shoes.</sentence><sentence id="2280">I mean, that was another scary ride.</sentence><sentence id="2281">I didn't take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise</span> until years later.</sentence><sentence id="2282">But we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halifax</span>, we -- they took on foo - - food, and oil.</sentence><sentence id="2283">And then we sailed down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2284">I didn't see the <span class="BUILDING">Statue of Liberty</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2285">We had</sentence><sentence id="2287">5 to be showing our papers downstairs, and when we got off, there was a man from the HIAS.</sentence><sentence id="2288">I don't know if you know that [indecipherable] on <span class="BUILDING">Esther Place</span>, I think it's still there.</sentence><sentence id="2289">They would take newcomers in who had nobody to meet them.</sentence><sentence id="2290">Most of them had some relatives, we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2291">So he took us down to the <span class="BUILDING">HIAS</span>, and that was really scary, I was scared.</sentence><sentence id="2292">We were sitting there, they told us to wait.</sentence><sentence id="2293">It was it -- two days before Thanksgiving.</sentence><sentence id="2294">And the two men came over from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2295">And my parent -- my sister and one of the guys went out one <span class="DLF">door</span> for a little walk, and I went out another <span class="DLF">door</span> with that guy who was very scruvy looking.</sentence><sentence id="2296">Unshaven.</sentence><sentence id="2297">He walked me around and around.</sentence><sentence id="2298">I said, I want to go back.</sentence><sentence id="2299">He wanted to sh -- he wanted to show me something.</sentence><sentence id="2300">I was say, gee whiz, I can't even tell the cops where I am.</sentence><sentence id="2301">I didn't have an address, what was going on?</sentence><sentence id="2302">But he wanted to show me <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woolworth</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2303">In those days, for one dollar, you could buy candies, and stocking, and stationery, everything was a dime or 15 cents.</sentence><sentence id="2304">I was overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="2305">Then he took me back.</sentence><sentence id="2306">But it -- it's very uncomfortable.</sentence><sentence id="2307">So we were in the -- that was Tuesday we arrived, Wednesday we went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> where the Jewish organizations were.</sentence><sentence id="2308">I was very disappointed.</sentence><sentence id="2309"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> in daylight was very scruffy, even then.</sentence><sentence id="2310">And the woman who took our particulars said we should come back on Monday because tomorrow is Thanksgiving, we won't work, and Friday we don't work.</sentence><sentence id="2311">What was Thanksgiving, we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="2312">So she gave an -- an appointment for Monday.</sentence><sentence id="2313">And I -- my sister and I, we went back to the HIAS, and my parents went to see that cousin, and -- who invited us for Thanksgiving dinner next day.</sentence><sentence id="2314">There were all kinds of family there, a big to-do.</sentence><sentence id="2315">I don't know if you know -- your -- "Life With Father"?</sentence><sentence id="2316">You don't know the play?</sentence><sentence id="2317">That was new at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2318">A whole string of redheads, Irish.</sentence><sentence id="2319">And when we came in, they said, the Irish fam -- "Life With Father".</sentence><sentence id="2320">We didn't know what it was all about.</sentence><sentence id="2321">So we met a cousin of mine and he took us out, and he said he had a friend who was in the employment agency of the [indecipherable] and we</sentence><sentence id="2323">6 should go there, and she introduced us, we had coffee with her, and she said we should come on Monday and see if we could get a job.</sentence><sentence id="2324">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="2325">So we were there on Tuesday, on Monday we had a job.</sentence><sentence id="2326">It was a -- two Viennese men were making gloves for the Army and Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And my sister sat on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> and made all those fingers.</sentence><sentence id="2328">You had to make, I think 10 dozen pairs.</sentence><sentence id="2329">You didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="2330">It was piecework.</sentence><sentence id="2331">And we were still in the HIAS because we -- everybody told us to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2332">They said it would be better in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, a small community would take care of us.</sentence><sentence id="2333">My sister and I, we sat there and my sister, she was a tough noodle, she sat next to the fastest person and matched.</sentence><sentence id="2334">She became the fastest one in the group.</sentence><sentence id="2335">I wasn't bad, either.</sentence><sentence id="2336">So in those days, the minimum was 10 dollars a week.</sentence><sentence id="2337">And she and I each made 18.</sentence><sentence id="2338">That was a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2339">And my -- we took work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my mother to finish.</sentence><sentence id="2340">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with big bags of gloves, and she finished it and we took them back.</sentence><sentence id="2341">I mean, she didn't work all night, it's the next day.</sentence><sentence id="2342">And so she earned some money.</sentence><sentence id="2343">My father had all kinds of funny jobs in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2344">He was working for a <span class="BUILDING">dental lab</span>, delivering the false teeth.</sentence><sentence id="2345">That's for the lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="2346">But he was really terrific, he did whatever came, and after awhile he got a job as a bookkeeper, where he stayed the rest of the time.</sentence><sentence id="2347">So between 18 and 18 and maybe my mother eight, my father maybe 12, that was, in those time, livable.</sentence><sentence id="2348">But of course, we bought yesterday's bread, was cheaper.</sentence><sentence id="2349">I went to my first movie after one year, on my birthday somebody took me.</sentence><sentence id="2350">A date was an ice cream soda with two straws.</sentence><sentence id="2351">I mean, it took doing.</sentence><sentence id="2352">And at first I could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I was war work, so you had to work long hours.</sentence><sentence id="2353">And once they did -- somebody told the Army and Navy, knitted gloves are no good, they wanted a -- what we made were liv -- knitted gloves with leather palm.</sentence><sentence id="2354">But they wanted leather gloves with lining.</sentence><sentence id="2355">All the soldiers in the ar -- [indecipherable] said ours are better, we have a better grip.</sentence><sentence id="2356">But, government.</sentence><sentence id="2357">So we didn't have government work any more, we made gloves for skiing, and that gave me a chance to</sentence><sentence id="2359">7 go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2360">And I went -- I don't know if you know it, on <span class="DLF">Lexington Ave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2361">in [indecipherable] is part of <span class="BUILDING">City College</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Brandeis

thought I was ready, I started in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, very much at the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="2365">I worked my way up, and my sister got married, and my father died in "56.</sentence><sentence id="2366">He died on the last day when he retired, he didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="2367">He collapsed in the <span
