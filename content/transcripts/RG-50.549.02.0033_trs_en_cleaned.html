<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="14">Let me -- Let me ask you to go back.</sentence><sentence id="15">You did a video interview about your experiences during the war --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: -- with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">But let's go back a bit and you've talked about this somewhat in that interview.</sentence><sentence id="19">Let's take it back maybe to a couple months before the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="26"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0033 3 end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="27">If you could just briefly describe what -- what your circumstances were, where you were, who you were with, and what was happening at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Well, we were liberated in, I think the third of December, of 1944, by the Scottish army and they were followed by I guess British and the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="29">But I don't know much about that any more.</sentence><sentence id="30">The -- Couple of months before that, we suffered immensely under real war conditions.</sentence><sentence id="31">In September they started dropping the troops in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnum</span>, and since I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fenlow</span> at that time, which isn't so far, we saw, actually it -- all the troops coming over in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, and it was on a Sunday, it was brilliant, sunny day, and I'll never forget it, because it was just immense.</sentence><sentence id="32">It -- It was never ending, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, which we later on found out were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span>, and that's really when our liberation sort of started, from that moment on, we were practically constantly under fire.</sentence><sentence id="33">And we -- we couldn't go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> any more and we didn't have gas and electricity and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="34">And life became very, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="35">I was still in hiding of course, and a few very dangerous things happened to my personally.</sentence><sentence id="36">We had no food so my stepmother and her daughter went out to get food in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, like cauliflowers an-and potatoes and things like that, cause the farmers couldn't get it, because the man didn't go <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, they -- the Germans were very much aware of the man and they wanted them to go to help them in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="37">So, and then, it was a couple of -- maybe -- it was in October, maybe then already, that some Germans came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">I was there with my stepfather, who was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, because he was on strike.</sentence><sentence id="39">The Dutch government had told all the people who worked for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> that they had to go on strike, so he did.</sentence><sentence id="40">And there</sentence><sentence id="42">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 4 was a son in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, who was supposed to be working for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="43">So, he was also somewhere hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so I had to open the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">And the Germans said they wanted to look in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they looked in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they decided the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was good.</sentence><sentence id="45">And they told me they were going to come back in the evening to live in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, for about two weeks, I think, they lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="47">And they sometimes asked for me, but I was every night very, very tired, so when they came in, my stepmother told them that well, I was so tired, I wasn't used to doing the housework and all that sort of stuff, so I always went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> early.</sentence><sentence id="48">So they never saw me.</sentence><sentence id="49">Course, they were scared that if they found out I was Jewish, that the whole family would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="50">So, when the war came closer and closer, the Germans left, because they -- they stayed away from the real fighting apparently.</sentence><sentence id="51">And then in December, we were finally liberated, but that was sort of difficult too, because the -- the Germans had recreated all the people who lived in our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they had to all go across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Maus</span>, into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and then up north, into the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">And they wanted all the regular people out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and they wanted to go -- go [indecipherable] us for the Americans and the British who were coming.</sentence><sentence id="53">So, my stepparents decided that I, who had no papers at all, was too much of a danger to take along on that kind of a trip, and so we all went into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="54">The man stayed somewhere, I don't know where, but we, the women, stayed in a bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and there we stayed for a couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="55">There was some food, there was water and that's where we were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="56">And it was, of course, still very, very dangerous, because the troops didn't cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and it was constant bombarding and</sentence><sentence id="58"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0033 5 grenade fire.</sentence><sentence id="59">So, we somehow crawled to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and then the British decided that they didn't want us there, so we were evacuated to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and there we stayed til I think the middle of April.</sentence><sentence id="60">In the meantime, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wasn't even liberated altogether, so while I was in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with my step-parents, and the son and the daughter, we were free.</sentence><sentence id="61">My step-parents kept on asking me, very unnoticed for me, really, my name and my -- my father's name.</sentence><sentence id="62">And then the next day they ask me my mother's name, and so they came -- in a couple of weeks they came to know who I really was, cause you never talked about it and you never wrote that down.</sentence><sentence id="63">And they apparently gave that to a Jewish organization who was trying to find all the children.</sentence><sentence id="64">And then they -- that organization decided that maybe it was a good thing for me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but -- then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, but I didn't want to hear about that, cause I wanted to know if I still somehow, would find my parents back.</sentence><sentence id="65">I had no idea where they were.</sentence><sentence id="66">So, they -- they decided they were going to keep me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for -- I don't know how long, maybe they would have taken me forever.</sentence><sentence id="67">And then my father, who was hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> first, but later on left for <span class="REGION">northern Holland</span>, somehow got himself involved in underground work.</sentence><sentence id="68">He was an artist and he was good in doing precise pictures, so he put part of the province where he was in, an-and mapped it for the underground and that was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, so that when the troops were coming, that they knew exactly where every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was, and where every little obstacle would be.</sentence><sentence id="69">And then somehow he was caught by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="70">They came in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to check something.</sentence><sentence id="71">He and the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were sent to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because they were listening to the English radio when the Germans walked in.</sentence><sentence id="72">And thank</sentence><sentence id="74">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 6 God my father didn't reveal that he was Jewish, and they never found out that he was Jewish, so he spent a couple of months in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">And had they known he was Jewish, they would, of course, have killed him instantly.</sentence><sentence id="76">But he was liberated there.</sentence><sentence id="77">And as it was, the troops apparently traveled with lists of children who were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="78">So, when my father came out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, they somehow presented him with a list.</sentence><sentence id="79">And my maiden name is D" Ancona, D'A, and when -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, it's -- the A counts as the main letter, so my name was on top, and my father found out that I was okay.</sentence><sentence id="80">But then the problem was he was up north and I was down south and there was no transportation in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, especially in the part where I was, everything was damaged and bombed, and there were no <span class="DLF">roads</span>, there was no public transportation, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="81">So, since my father had worked for the underground, he got some letters from important people, I would say, who gave him permission to travel.</sentence><sentence id="82">So he somehow talked himself into being allowed to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>, and you know, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> without tires.</sentence><sentence id="83">And he came one day to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was hidden, and I then lived in freedom.</sentence><sentence id="84">And well, he knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and we didn't get many visitors there, and so when I heard a man speak, I knew right away it was my dad.</sentence><sentence id="85">And at that time I found out that my mother was caught by the Germans and that she had gone away, that she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, and after that was sent to wherever, and that we had no way of knowing if my mother had survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Well, my par -- we were -- we were -- we all went in hide -- in hiding at same time.</sentence><sentence id="167">I was taken by an organization to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and to a family that I had never met in my life, didn't know the people, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: You say an organization, do you know the name of it, or who those people were?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Ah, well they called them Emfay, which is in Dutch, the same as LTD.</sentence><sentence id="170">And the -- the organization was started by a man, Mr. Debrown, which was not his real name, and he had helpers, young man and young women, who took the kids from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="171">When - - When you were picked up from your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, small children were put in a - - sort of what -- what used to be a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and the parents were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in what used to be a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">And then, before they went on transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, and those children, those young children were taken care of by Jewish people, most likely, I think, nurses, and people who took care of kids.</sentence><sentence id="173">And they went out for walks sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="174">And the organization had made it their business to steal some of those children.</sentence><sentence id="175">So, every day when some of those kids were walked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to get a little fresh air, -- and I'm sure that it was prearranged with help <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, that certain children were going to be taken away.</sentence><sentence id="176">So</sentence></p><p><sentence id="179"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0033 8 they had as many clothes on as possible.</sentence><sentence id="180">And then they walked at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, cause there were like maybe 10 or 15 kids, and then at the end, and then those young people came and just stole them away.</sentence><sentence id="181">And how they organized getting rid of their papers and -- I have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="182">I guess that's known in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> how it went, but those children were just rescued.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I was still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">I was one of the very, very last in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, who lived in their own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that was because we are Sephardic.</sentence><sentence id="185">My father and my mother both are from Sephardic descent, and the Germans, with all their crazy rules and regulations had, at some point said that most of the Sephardine were going to be descendants from Aranos, which most likely was true, and we were not really Jews, we were Christians.</sentence><sentence id="186">So, my parents tried everything in the world to get us declared non-Jews, not because they didn't want to be Jews, but you know, it was important not to have to go to the other side of the world.</sentence><sentence id="187">I don't know what -- what my parents knew about what was waiting on the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">I didn't know an awful lot, because as much as possible was kept away from me.</sentence><sentence id="189">But I knew, and everybody knew that, that it wasn't very good.</sentence><sentence id="190">So, we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>; in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> still quote quote free, in October of 1990 -- in 1943 were -- and was practically no Jew left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">There was no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more, and there was no organiz -- organized life for Jews any more.</sentence><sentence id="192">So, on the 16" of October, my father decided that since we weren't declared non-Jews, we had to go.</sentence><sentence id="193">So, my father found this organization and they said they would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="194">So, on mon -- and one morning they came -- and the lady came to pick me up and she took me along to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and there she handed me to a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="197">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0033 9 young man, and he took me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with another child that I never saw again, and we traveled a long distance.</sentence><sentence id="198">We had to change the pla -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we took another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">Then we finally came at the destined <span class="NPIP">place</span> and this young man said to me, "Well, you just wait here."</sentence><sentence id="200">And he took the young man with him and came back maybe three quarters of an hour later, half an hour later, without the young man, but that a -- that time that I had to wait at that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was like -- like a year.</sentence><sentence id="201">It was never ending, and here I was, I was in -- I mean, I was 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="202">I was -- I was child, but I was -- I was aware of the dangers.</sentence><sentence id="203">I had no name, I didn't know where I lived, I -- I -- I -- I was nobody, and if they -- somebody had come up to me and said, "Where are you going, what are you doing, are you waiting for somebody?"</sentence><sentence id="204">I couldn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="205">So, I was very, very scared.</sentence><sentence id="206">And then when he came back, he came on back with a -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, so I went with him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he dropped me off at this family.</sentence><sentence id="207">And there I stayed for the rest of the year and -- and another year.</sentence><sentence id="208">And I was very, very different from my own <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">I came from a middle class family, nothing very fancy, but these people, the man was working for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, he repaired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And they were fine people, there's nothing to s -- be said about them, they were risking their life for me, they knew what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="211">And they were terrific.</sentence><sentence id="212">But it was an altogether different life than what I was used to.</sentence><sentence id="213">They were going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> all the time, they read the Bible, they prayed every day and I wasn't used to that at all, cause my parents were atheist, and -- not that they wanted to deny they were Jewish, but there was absolutely no religion in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and so --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="216"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0033 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: And these people were not Jewish, that you're with, or they are?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: No, no, no, they were Christians.</sentence></p></dialogue>
