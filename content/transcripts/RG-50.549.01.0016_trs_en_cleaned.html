<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="40">Q: Do you remember if you prayed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: | can't remember that, | can't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="43">I, | mean | know all the prayers because | had to pretend, you know, but | don't, as | said, it's hard to be quite authentic, but being, knowing the religious feelings that | don't harbor now, or the anti-religious feelings that | harbor and have, apparently, since really childhood, according to my parents, it's hard to believe that | was swayed by anything more than the sense of, this is going to protect me, you know, so maybe it's worth doing.</sentence><sentence id="44">But not, | don't think | had, | certainly never believed in Jesus Christ or anything of the kind.</sentence><sentence id="45">| mean, that stuff was not believable, but, not that any other was, but | mean this in particular, | found very hard to stomach, so, but as | said, the atmosphere and the big voices and the, you know, the echoes in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and all the people that looked so, umm, you know, they looked very happy to be there and they looked like they were participating and so on, and | was participating but knowing | was a fake, you know, and, but | don't think | ever prayed to anybody with conviction.</sentence><sentence id="46">Never.</sentence><sentence id="47">So | don't think | did.</sentence><sentence id="48">But | did pray, because | certainly had to go to communion and say all the words and go to confession and confess to sins that | made up.</sentence><sentence id="49">You know, things of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="50">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: You were a performer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: | think to some extent, but that was part of the game, you know, if | had to change names, | had to change everything about myself, so |, but | knew it was fake, you know, | never, | think, totally took on the other identity.</sentence><sentence id="64">| don't think | ever did, | mean whoever | was, | mean | certainly got, I'm sure | got to some extent, you know, damaged by this whole experience, but maybe not, not as much as, if one listens to the scripture and you could expect somebody who would be much worse shape than |, lam, maybe, | think | was in pretty bad shape, actually, right after the war.</sentence><sentence id="65">| was really in, but nobody had time to pay attention, so | just had to pull myself together, | think that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="66">| don't think anyone had the time to pay any attention to me.</sentence><sentence id="67">So | just had to survive, which | had learned, you know, to survive.</sentence><sentence id="68">So, that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: That's the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="78">But, it's very difficult, you know, | am a very successful person, | mean |, and when, that's why | don't like to go to reunions of hidden children anymore because | feel that maybe I'm just an elitist, you know, and that's all there is to it, but |, there are a lot of people who are still whining about this and it's, | don't, really don't want to downplay it in any sense, but it's past and a lot of people have bad things happen to them in life.</sentence><sentence id="79">And if you're going to just focus on those things, you're just not going to get anywhere and |, | can't, | cannot go and sit there and talk about this over and over and over.</sentence><sentence id="80">And, you know, maybe it's denial for me which is, that's possible, too, | just don't want to deal with it anymore.</sentence><sentence id="81">| mean, I'm happy to tell you my story, but | don't think that what's happening in my life now or let's say to a great extent, has that much to do with that experience.</sentence><sentence id="82">| think I've, | know myself pretty well now and I, | can tell, you know, where things are coming from more than just blaming it all on the war and everything of that nature.</sentence><sentence id="83">So.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: You're wearing, are those diamond earrings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Are those from your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="101">Well, they're actually, my husband gave them to me, but all our families are in diamonds, so, | mean both my parents and his parents were both into diamonds, so that's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: One of the things | was curious about reading your family history, your father's history, is that you're feeling toward diamonds now, because you had talked about how, when you fled, your mother took the diamonds and threw them out the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="106">That's quite a dramatic image.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yeah, | always try to, you know, save some, to try and sell them and that's all they had, was diamonds.</sentence><sentence id="108">They had nothing, no property, no money really to speak of, but the diamonds that they were dealing with, they could try and sell to survive.</sentence><sentence id="109">So, that's...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: So the ones in your ears aren't part of that pile?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="116">They're not.</sentence><sentence id="117">I, | didn't, there is nothing, | mean the only diamonds actually that survived the war, was my mother's engagement ring, but no, my in-laws, actually, because they came here, so they, they fled, but they fled as a family and they didn't really go through any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or anything, so whatever they took with them they, except for what they had to spend to bribe officials along the way to survive, they came with quite a bit of diamonds with them, so my mother-in-laws jewelry that she gave me along the years, those are really pre-war, many of them.</sentence><sentence id="118">My mother didn't have that much to begin with and she didn't, she wasn't able to keep much of it and so, the only thing is her engagement ring, that's the only thing that actually survived the war and | have that.</sentence><sentence id="119">So, that's pretty nice.</sentence><sentence id="120">So.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Do you wear it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="130">No, | put that away.</sentence><sentence id="131">| have my own engagement ring, which | actually very rarely wear.</sentence><sentence id="132">So, and my mom just passed away, you know, and it's very hard for me to take her jewels and put it on, | just put them away someplace.</sentence><sentence id="133">And | think, my daughter isn't married and if she does, at some point, | want to give it to her.</sentence><sentence id="134">Because she was very close to my mother so | would give it to her.</sentence><sentence id="135">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: You had talked about being in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> and the sweet potatoes or the sweet potato-like things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Ah, please.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: All right, I'm not going to ask quite about that, but you said there was a song about it and | was wondering of you remembered the song?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Umm, yes, there was a song that just came back to me not too long ago which had to do with getting up in the morning and having to go wash.</sentence><sentence id="150">How was that?</sentence><sentence id="151">[Singing in French].</sentence><sentence id="152">So that was a song to get our, [French phrase], which is whatever.</sentence><sentence id="153">And [French phrase] was, is that sweet potato or whatever it is, | don't know if | remember that song.</sentence><sentence id="154">It will come back maybe.</sentence><sentence id="155">If | think about it, it won't, but it might just spring up at some point.</sentence><sentence id="156">There's a fellow that lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> who is my childhood friend and he's now the only one alive because his parents died just over the last two years, they were in their 80's and his sister, unfortunately, was a very good friend of mine, and she died at age 21 in childbirth, so he's the only, and he seems to have a better memory than | do for these things.</sentence><sentence id="157">| mean, he actually went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we had been hidden and looked up the priest who had been in charge of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it apparently has not turned into some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> or <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: Where is this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: This is in Von Deen(ph), which is in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> and he recognized it, he said he really did and he took some pictures and he showed me.</sentence><sentence id="171">| don't think | remember it quite as well as he does.</sentence><sentence id="172">And we're the same age, so it's not a matter, he's six months older, so it's not a matter, | think | just tuned out a lot of it.</sentence><sentence id="173">Just tuned it out, it was just too awful.</sentence><sentence id="174">So | don't think | would really recognize it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: You were, until you were 10, you were the only child, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: Did you feel more responsibility because you were the only one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Towards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Toward your mother, for example.</sentence><sentence id="189">Responsibility to kind of keep alive and keep going?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Well, | think I, | took a lot of responsibility on, for that friend of mine who, because we were together and she was two years younger and as | was, | would say essentially, anorectic(ph) and she, but not anorectic in terms of throwing up, but just wouldn't eat, | mean | was just not interested in food, but not that | had an image of being fat or what goes along with anorexia these days, just, just so distraught that | couldn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="191">But she on the contrary, being upset, she wanted to eat more, every time, so we were the opposite and we would go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and steal food for her at night and so | was, | felt very responsible for her.</sentence><sentence id="192">| don't think | felt responsible for my mother or to stay alive for any other reason than | just wanted to be alive.</sentence><sentence id="193">You know, not for any particular reason.</sentence><sentence id="194">No, | don't think, | think, | can't remember if my mother, you know, felt or made me feel very safe, | can't say that.</sentence><sentence id="195">| think | did feel abandoned quite frequently because she was gone a lot.</sentence><sentence id="196">So I, no, | don't think there was any consideration of my mother, of me doing something for her, protecting her,</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="204">| think it was clearly the opposite.</sentence><sentence id="205">Even though | didn't feel that protected by her, | felt more protected by playing the Catholic girl and going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with our neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="206">You know, | felt a lot more safe than being with her.</sentence><sentence id="207">And in some ways, when she didn't learn, she didn't know French very well and she learned it, you know, on the run and she had a pretty heavy accent, even though she learned the language, and so | didn't feel comfortable with her.</sentence><sentence id="208">| mean, | sort of thought she was going to get us into trouble more than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="209">And |, | don't know if | said that on the tape, but | was very nasty, | mean | was extremely nasty, and you know, just plain old angry.</sentence><sentence id="210">And | threatened the people that she used to put up with the denouncing them to the Germans, thinking they're not going to catch me because I'm this French girl, you know.</sentence><sentence id="211">But they'll catch you.</sentence><sentence id="212">And scaring people to death, you know, just scaring them to death.</sentence><sentence id="213">And it was silly, | mean | was this six year old, | really wasn't going to go up to, and | knew that | was never going to do that and | knew that | was just as, as much in danger as they were, but | could go out and pretend to be whoever | was and they couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="214">You know, they didn't know the language or they didn't appear to be totally French, you know, and also | would really torture them, make them feel very sad.</sentence><sentence id="215">Some of them have, you know, they're all dying out now, but they reminded me of that frequently as | went back to visit my mother, which | did frequently.</sentence><sentence id="216">So, | was not a nice person, not a nice kid, | mean just not at all.</sentence><sentence id="217">Not at all.</sentence><sentence id="218">And you're interested in what's happening after the war, so after the war, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, | mean | was an absolute terror.</sentence><sentence id="219">| mean, a completely uncontrollable terror.</sentence><sentence id="220">And, but | was smart, you know, and | knew | could get away with it because our class was made up of just really the dregs of the earth and, you know, people of all ages speaking different languages.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="238">Q: Where was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: That was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, so we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="245">And so | went to, so there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> which had been flourishing before the war, but at that point it was just sort of in shambles and the teachers were themselves survivors and nothing that relates to modern pedagogical methods had reached the shores, even among the non-Jewish teachers, | mean they were still pretty much versed in ancient methods of discipline and, and as | said, the class was made up for, of all kind so of people, all kinds of ages and some spoke just and some spoke Polish and some spoke Hungarian and some, you know, it was just really the Tower of Babel and, but | knew French and that was a big advantage and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: How many languages did you know then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Well then, | knew, | don't know what | knew because | grew up in Yiddish and Polish and | learned French really well, so at least those three | knew.</sentence><sentence id="254">But!</sentence><sentence id="255">didn't get to practice that, those that much, | mean | went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it was French, so | spoke French at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then they taught me Hebrew, they started to in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and, you know, | just had great ease of learning so they used to parade me in front of, you know, they were trying desperately to get money for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so the donors came and, you know, you have to parade the monkeys in front of them, so they, | was their monkey, you know, they knew that they could rely on me for giving the right answers and reading and doing all these things to see their wonderful methods of teaching and so | would really take advantage of that.</sentence><sentence id="256">| mean, | knew this was a game for them, you know, it was a great thing to have somebody to show and | would just totally, totally not follow any rules.</sentence><sentence id="257">| would jump on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> and | would be, you know, when there was no inspection, when they came for inspection | performed, | did everything according to what they expected me to do, but as soon as they left, you know, these donors and inspectors and whatnot, | would just go wild, just wild.</sentence><sentence id="258">In fact, a couple of, about six months, well eight months ago, | was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> visiting my mother, just a week before she died, and we went to a go-away party for my uncle who is also 80-something and who moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with his family.</sentence><sentence id="259">So my mother and | went to it and one of my Hebrew teachers from that time was there and a very strange thing happened because | had not seen the man in, oh probably 30 years, and he came up and he says, "Is that you?"</sentence><sentence id="260">And | said, "Yes".</sentence><sentence id="261">And he says, "You know, look at my gray hair, you did this to me".</sentence><sentence id="262">He said, well me and, you know, a couple of years.</sentence><sentence id="263">But then, so we talked awhile, then it was really funny because his daughter was there and she said, "I don't know how he recognized you because he's blind and he doesn't see anything".</sentence><sentence id="264">Because | couldn't tell, you know, | saw him and | greeted him and just from the voice, or | don't know what, | mean it was very funny, very funny.</sentence><sentence id="265">So | really made an impression on this man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: What language was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> taught in since people spoke so many languages?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Well see, it had been, this is before the uproar, this is just at the time when the uproar began between Flemish and French in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, so, and this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had been a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">private day school</span> just like there are some here, and so we were taught in French, which is, that was it, we had to be taught in French and the Hebrew teachers taught without speaking any other language essentially.</sentence><sentence id="282">There was not translation, you were taught the alphabet and that's, now kids learn very quickly, they really do.</sentence><sentence id="283">| mean, all this bilingual crap is crap, it's ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="284">Because we came from so many different <span class="NPIP">parts</span> and we all learned French in a matter of months.</sentence><sentence id="285">| mean, | knew it but everybody spoke French in a matter of months.</sentence><sentence id="286">Even just, and as | said, we did not have sophisticated teaching methods or <span class="BUILDING">language labs</span> or anything, it was just.</sentence><sentence id="287">When you know you have to, you learn.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Were you aware that the war had ended?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="292">Oh, yes, absolutely.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: How did you become aware of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Well, for one, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they had this incredible celebration, Victory Day, so there was no, no avoiding knowing it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: Do you remember that day?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Not in great detail, | just remember more of an impression of people jumping in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and music and dancing and, but | was, you know, an eight year old, | mean | can't remember details, | just remember that everybody was just elated and then we took down the, we had these black blankets on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> because we had curfews, so you know, the light wouldn't go out, wouldn't shine in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, we took off all of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="303">Q: Who's we?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: My mother and | who lived in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba(ph</span>), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba</span>, and the neighbors, you know, were all so happy because the neighbor, the man, had been in World War | and he had been injured, in fact, in World War | and he had no love for the Germans at all, so he was, you know, very, very happy, even though in this war they didn't suffer that much.</sentence><sentence id="310">He was too old to join and he was, anyway, he was injured, so he was really, really, really happy.</sentence><sentence id="311">And then, so that's, you know, how we found out.</sentence><sentence id="312">| mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> and everybody was just extremely, extremely excited.</sentence><sentence id="313">So there was just a joy in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and everybody, people pouring out from every <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, there was just thousands of people even though it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it looked to me like, you know, thousands of people.</sentence><sentence id="314">| really don't know how many they were.</sentence><sentence id="315">So that's, essentially, what | remember.</sentence><sentence id="316">And | remember then, somehow, my mother getting notice that my father had returned.</sentence><sentence id="317">And leaving me there to go find him.</sentence><sentence id="318">So she left me with those neighbors and so that, | remember that and | remember when she came for me, she had actually found him and we went back and that trip was horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="319">And it was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, you know, just one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with, not even covered, but some sort of tarp cover, that's it, and we traveled from there and it took days and days and days.</sentence><sentence id="320">| don't know who was driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, | have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="321">And it just, see, certain stupid things, | mean, I, | was still very nasty and very angry and at some stop there was nothing to drink except beer and | said that | would rather die than drink beer, you know, just as a, who knows why?</sentence><sentence id="322">You know, | mean if you're really, really thirsty you'll drink beer and | was thirsty, but | said | would rather die than drink beer.</sentence><sentence id="323">And | don't like beer to this day, so | mean, why?</sentence><sentence id="324">Who knows?</sentence><sentence id="325">Just a stupid, you know, detail that comes to mind.</sentence><sentence id="326">And so we went back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: You went back to where?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we had lived in was pretty much destroyed, so, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba</span> we had met a woman who had two children who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="349">And she owned a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and her husband had been deported and she didn't know whether he would come back or not, but she had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with several <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and she said that she, we could come and live in her <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you know, for rent.</sentence><sentence id="350">And so we did.</sentence><sentence id="351">We moved, my mother, my father, myself, moved to that, we moved to the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had three flights.</sentence><sentence id="352">It was like one of these <span class="BUILDING">railroad houses</span>, very skinny, everything was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> behind the other.</sentence><sentence id="353">And there was no running water, | remember that very well.</sentence><sentence id="354">There was no central heat.</sentence><sentence id="355">So we had to pump the water.</sentence><sentence id="356">And we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal stove</span> to do everything, basically.</sentence><sentence id="357">And at first, when we first got back, my parents and | went to a sort of an <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> in the Ardennes(ph), which is the hilly part, they call it <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, but in reality it's just <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>, hilly part of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and | think that was the only time in his life that my father ate non-kosher food.[end of side 1 of tape 1].</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="369">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="370">It's the only time in his life your father ate non-kosher food?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="374">And it was really to get him back on his feet.</sentence><sentence id="375">| mean, he accepted that, it was a necessity, there was no kosher food and he needed to just get back on his feet.</sentence><sentence id="376">So, we went, | think originally it was supposed to be for a month, but no sooner we were there, my mother took off and she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> because there were many people who were getting married who had been separated during the war and got together and she went to cook for weddings.</sentence><sentence id="377">Not for money, you know, just out of, you know, community feeling.</sentence><sentence id="378">And so she left us and she would come back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="379">You know, she would be doing all these charity, volunteer and whatever kind of works, so she didn't stay the full month, but my dad and | did.</sentence><sentence id="380">And then we went and moved into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> that | told you about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: I'm just curious, when you saw your father, you hadn't seen him, for a time you didn't know if you would see him, you had been very close to him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: | had been extremely close, so that was a terrible disappointment, terrible, terrible disappointment because, well, what you remember as a three or four year old from your father is very different from the way you see him at age eight or nine, particularly since there hasn't been a progression, you know.</sentence><sentence id="392">So, and | was extremely disappointed because he was extremely orthodox and wanted me to be that way.</sentence><sentence id="393">And extremely rigid in his, the practice of religion where, you know, he wouldn't allow me to turn on the light on the Sabbath, | mean he was extremely, extremely, extremely strict and rigid and | could not abide by this.</sentence><sentence id="394">| just could, | didn't believe in it and | kept telling him that | didn't see how, after what he's gone through, he could still believe in this sort of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="395">And so there was really a crack in our relationship because of that.</sentence><sentence id="396">You know, he tried, on other <span class="NPIP">fronts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="397">| mean, my father was not an educated man and he would make an effort and take me to the movies and | know that this was not something that he would have done normally, this is something he really did to try and regain some, some closeness with me.</sentence><sentence id="398">| mean, I'm sure he missed it, too, but he just didn't know how to go about it.</sentence><sentence id="399">And | think in some ways, he was soiled, you know, as far as, why did he let himself be taken?</sentence><sentence id="400">Why didn't he, why wasn't he the strong man | thought he was in, you know, protecting us all and why did he just disappear?</sentence><sentence id="401">| mean, he just, he was supposed to meet us somewhere and he never showed up.</sentence><sentence id="402">You know, and at that time, | think | had this certain resentment towards him for being my fallen hero, you know, why didn't, why didn't you protect us and why were you gone and why were you, come back in such a decrepit state, you know, you look terrible and, you know, you can't really be my strong father.</sentence><sentence id="403">You know, so | had a lot of that.</sentence><sentence id="404">And | don't think | could tell him, | really couldn't, the only fights that we openly had was about religion.</sentence><sentence id="405">And | think | then channeled everything into absolutely refusing to have anything to do with the religion because | got, you know, it was a little inconsistent, like angry at God like for allowing this to, and then somebody who allows this to happen, can't exist, just can't be.</sentence><sentence id="406">So that was the end of my religious, and we fought about that for a very, very long time.</sentence><sentence id="407">Through my teens it was really bad, really bad because there were very few of us left, for one, of children my age who returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">And the majority of them were not observant and so, | mean their families weren't, and by forcing me to, you know, stay in on the Sabbath and not being able to go to the movies like Saturday afternoon, | was cut out from a lot of social activities, as well, so | resented that terribly, terribly, so | was really angry as an adolescent.</sentence><sentence id="409">| mean, on top of everything else, | was not a, not a happy camper in my youth.</sentence><sentence id="410">Not at all.</sentence><sentence id="411">So | don't think | ever, | mean now, you know, my father has been dead for 20 years or more, | can understand what he was about and how strong he actually had been to survive this and to be able to rebuild a family and bring his entire family, his entire surviving family to live with us after having gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> himself.</sentence><sentence id="412">And making money just to, you know, feed all these brothers and sisters, | mean two brothers, a sister and his father moved in with us, into that <span class="NPIP">place</span> what didn't have water.</sentence><sentence id="413">His father, a sister and two brothers, right.</sentence><sentence id="414">You know, and | just resented that awfully, | mean | wasn't, not charitable at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="440">Q: How long had you been reunited with your father before the rest of his family came?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="442">A: Not that long because a few, when my parents, my brother was born in May, "46, so maybe a year or less after they had been reunited.</sentence><sentence id="443">And that family, | think, moved in with, my brother was clearly an infant, so | don't know if they moved in just before or, he was born, or right after, so that's not clear in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="444">But they, my father found some smuggler and he paid him a lot of money to go and rescue whoever was left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Where were they?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: Well, they were actually in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">They made it to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="453">And | don't know how he found out about it, | really don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: That was going to be my next question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: | don't know, but they, they were people coming from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> and they tried to find people who were from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that they had been and then they would, | think it's just word of mouth.</sentence><sentence id="460">On the other hand, they knew, since my father had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> since 1933, his family knew that, at least he had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, they didn't know whether he, where he went during the war of if he had ever, if he had stayed or if he had returned, if he hadn't stayed.</sentence><sentence id="461">So | think they might have tried to contact the, you know, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Refugee Agency</span> and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="462">So it was probably a little bit word of mouth, a little bit through official channels, you know, Jewish or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="463">| would imagine that that's how they found each other.</sentence><sentence id="464">Because they knew at least to look for him in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where he didn't know where to look for them at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="471">Q: So less than a year, obviously, if your brother was born in "46?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="473">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="475">Q: After you got together as a family, suddenly the family dynamic changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="477">A: Entirely.</sentence><sentence id="478">What are you doing here?</sentence><sentence id="479">Sylvan(ph)?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="480">[Greetings exchanged between parties in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and someone who came in -- tape turned off briefly].</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: So, yeah the dynamics changed completely from being a family with just one child, to a family with two children and uncles and aunts and grandfather, to boot.</sentence><sentence id="482">And | felt that my mother was completely unavailable to me, essentially.</sentence><sentence id="483">Because she was completely hassled, | mean, but again, | can see that now and as an adult, but as a child, | didn't see that at all.</sentence><sentence id="484">| mean, it was just like now you get this stupid baby and all these other people living with us, you know, and now then we could maybe be happy or, you know, have, you're not there.</sentence><sentence id="485">And then she was running all her volunteer activities on top of everything else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="491">Q: So tell me what it was like, you're, what, 10 years old or something?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="496">A: Yeah, about 10.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: And you've got a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without running water, with all sorts of people, many of whom you've never met before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: Yeah, most of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="502">Q: And you had said earlier, that this was a time when you really needed attention and you really didn't have it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="504">A: Yeah, that's true, | didn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="505">At least, | felt | didn't have any, I'm sure that | did have, you know, | mean my basic needs were taken care of, | mean | had food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and | had clothes and | went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and | even, well | don't know if in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, a little later, | got piano lessons because | was dying to play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">So they bought me some kind of secondhand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upright piano</span> which | still remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="510">Q: Do you still play?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="512">A: Not much, no, | always say I'm going to go back to it, but, | used to play quite well, but | didn't really pursue that very much, after 15 or 16 years of age | gave up.</sentence><sentence id="513">So again, it was a matter of feeling, you know, in that first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad house</span>, as | said, so the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was all the way in the front, behind it was something which was more, was the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> | would say, and then in the back of it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> that wasn't used at all, and then in the back of it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="514">And the first, | don't know whether months, how long, but the first, for sure, month that we lived there, my parents and | slept in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> used to collapse.</sentence><sentence id="515">It was extremely frightening.</sentence><sentence id="516">It was, | don't know what it was made of, it was some cheap <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood bed</span> and it would just collapse and we would find each other, you know, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">And my father had these incredible nightmares and he would be screaming, aside from that.</sentence><sentence id="518">And | had my own nightmares.</sentence><sentence id="519">So it was a <span class="NPIP">nightmare</span>, it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">And then, again, | can't say for, it's six months or a year, they bought me some kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> where | was in the so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and the family, the additional, the uncles and aunts and that group, moved to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span>, so we had the first, <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>, the family, the owners, had the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> right on top of us, the owner's husband did not come back from the war, so she was with two children by herself, so she needed the rent, and then the <span class="INT_SPACE">top floor</span> was for the two uncles, the aunt and the grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="521">But food was all at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, everything, laundry, food, everything.</sentence><sentence id="522">Without <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span>, without any, you know, fancy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">appliance</span> of any kind, so in some ways, in some ways it was almost worse than during the war.</sentence><sentence id="523">Because during the war, | had some kind of stability, | mean for the last couple of years when | lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Exleba</span>, as | said, | was in terror but it was, to some extent | had accommodated to the terror.</sentence><sentence id="524">There was not that much unpredictable that was happening.</sentence><sentence id="525">We had our air raids and we'd run off and go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>, by that time | had one name and that didn't change any more and | had some sort of routine.</sentence><sentence id="526">And my mother, when she was there, was there for me, there was no, she had all these people that she was hiding and so on, but still, | felt that she was there, you know, for me.</sentence><sentence id="527">We would go to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> together on occasion and we would do things together, whatever they were.</sentence><sentence id="528">But then she disappeared, essentially.</sentence><sentence id="529">She was diluted so much to such an extent that in some ways, | felt more abandoned than during the war, even though | wasn't afraid for my life.</sentence><sentence id="530">| mean, and so my, | think a lot of that anger was due to the fact that | was just lost, you know, just, it felt like | was to take care of myself plus take care of my brother.</sentence><sentence id="531">Which | had to do, | mean | had to babysit for him and, because we couldn't afford any help, and my mother was just unable to do everything, she was doing care for my brother, you know, day and night, so when | came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, | mean | had to watch my brother, | had to, | learned how to cook very early because | had to help for, you know, for making a meal for Friday night for 10 people without, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">appliances</span>, | mean on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal stove</span> and it was a Friday night and for Saturday lunch and for Saturday evening before you could turn on the lights again.</sentence><sentence id="532">| mean, that sort of, so | had to pitch in, come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Friday early and help my mother or watch my brother or both and | didn't have much time to be a kid, you know.</sentence><sentence id="533">Just not much time.</sentence><sentence id="534">But, the lady who rented the <span class="NPIP">place</span> had two children and one boy was about a year or two older than | was at the time and he and | had become really good friends in the war and sort of partners in crime, you know, we could think of every possible mischief and we would just do it.</sentence><sentence id="535">And so we continued that.</sentence><sentence id="536">And we established, he was very mechanically gifted, in fact, he's an aeronautics engineer for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, for the Israel government, so that really panned out.</sentence><sentence id="537">And we would just build things and we'd build some kind of telephone between his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and mine and we'd go to the, there was a <span class="BUILDING">flea market</span> every Sunday morning and we'd go and we'd buy all these components and we'd build radios and so dolls was really not my thing.</sentence><sentence id="538">It was erector sets and radios and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="539">So he had a tremendous influence on me.</sentence><sentence id="540">Unfortunately, he left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when, | mean he and his mother and sister left when he was about 13, so that was a terrible loss.</sentence><sentence id="541">And we used to, we were inseparable, inseparable, but we also would fight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="573">Q: What was his name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="575">A: Bobby, Bobby Ackleman(ph).</sentence><sentence id="576">| don't know what they call him now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but, and he, we would fight and he was stubborn and | was stubborn, and so we wouldn't talk for weeks on end, and we'd go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together and we'd walk one behind the other, without exchanging a word.</sentence><sentence id="577">And then we'd wait for each other to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we wouldn't say a word.</sentence><sentence id="578">It's very funny.</sentence><sentence id="579">We had a lot of imaginary games and then we'd, we'd build swords, swords out of wood, and shields and paint them.</sentence><sentence id="580">And my favorite book was the Three Musketeers, and so | would read that over and over and over again.</sentence><sentence id="581">And so we'd play the Musketeers and we'd have sword fights and, so | hada good time, | mean it's not like | was completely miserable at all times, but | think | was very troubled, you know, a very troubled person.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="590">Q: Which Musketeer were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="592">A: | think | was , you know.</sentence><sentence id="593">And we had an <span class="REGION">area</span> not far from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which now is really built up, but it was, they called it in Flemish, the Barta(ph), which is like the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>, you know, and it was really very rural, there was nothing, there were some old fortifications from World War | and we'd use those, you know, to hide and play and have war games and really not very, you know, pacifist type of, but mostly like little boy's games, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="596">Q: You had mentioned that when you were very young, your father treated you as if you were a son.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1042">Q: Wait a second, hold it, hold it, you're skipping over this.</sentence><sentence id="1043">How did you know that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1046">A: | don't know, | just knew | wanted to be something and doctor seemed extremely heroic, so | guess | was very impressed by the doctors | went to.</sentence><sentence id="1047">You know, they seemed to have such power and, you know, everybody was very deferent to doctors.</sentence><sentence id="1048">So, | don't think | was in it really to help people, | think | was in it more for interest.</sentence><sentence id="1049">So, that's what | was going to be.</sentence><sentence id="1050">And, so in order to do that, | couldn't stay in that, see that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was, as | said, in shambles, it was the remnants of a pre-war, very, very fine <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, but because, so the system in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was that if you went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, you could get into <span class="BUILDING">university</span> after graduation, you didn't need to take a special test.</sentence><sentence id="1051">But, if you went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, you had to take a very, very thorough sort of baccalaureate type of exam.</sentence><sentence id="1052">So, and you had to, in order to get to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, at that point, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flemish town</span>, so you had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flemish</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1053">| didn't know any Flemish, really not, | mean | just knew a few words to talk to the cleaning woman and | didn't have a lot of interaction with her because when she was there | was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and | hardly ever saw her.</sentence><sentence id="1054">So that was a bit of a problem because you had to have an admissions test in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flemish</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1055">So, | don't know, see people think maybe I'm lying, but I'm not, | mean | went and | took the test anda friend of mine came with me and she copied everything from me and she didn't get in.</sentence><sentence id="1056">So, but | don't know, | mixed French and Flemish and whatever | could think of, you know, in the answers.</sentence><sentence id="1057">| mean, the, | don't know what the questions were and | only had three years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and everything was, really, | knew nothing really well except reading, that's all | really knew.</sentence><sentence id="1058">Well, the rest | knew, math was terrible, because | didn't have the elementary stuff, you know, | was really bad.</sentence><sentence id="1059">And so | got into this extremely, extremely difficult <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> that had six years of studies.</sentence><sentence id="1060">And in order to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, you had to take the classic tract, so the classic tract was Latin and Greek.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Plus Flemish, of course, which was the main, plus six hours of math a week.</sentence><sentence id="1062">| mean, this was really horrible, and my experience at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was terrible, just terrible because there were only two Jewish girls in it and even though it was really a <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span>, it was a public secular school, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> they have, as they have here, a Catholic system that is parallel to the public system, | obviously, so the people who came to the <span class="BUILDING">secular schools</span> were not Catholic, or at least not practicing or not very serious about their religion since they chose the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1063">But | still felt very alienated and really not welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1064">| felt there was real anti-semitism there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1085">Q: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> in general it was this feeling at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1087">A: Well, | couldn't tell because the Jews really lived very much in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, even though they didn't live that much physically a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they lived spiritually and culturally in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there was very little mixing.</sentence><sentence id="1088">So the only traces of anti-semitism were, | have a friend who lives down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, she's several years older, and we sometimes speak Flemish just kind of out of, you know, out of fun and there is one kind of joke we have, is if we haven't heard from each other for a long time, she'll greet me like in Flemish, [Flemish phrase], like, are you still alive?</sentence><sentence id="1089">And she said that's how they greeted her when she came back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, like, , gee, you know, | thought you were dead.</sentence><sentence id="1090">So, that was the atmosphere among the Flemish, although many had been hiding Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1091">They really then had a concerted effort to rescue Jewish children and hide them, but obviously, there were a fair number of people who, and you know, it's, | couldn't even say that it was vicious, it was like having no clue and say, oh, you know, well, we thought you were dead, kind of a thing.</sentence><sentence id="1092">But just imagine, when you have survived something like this, you don't feel that great.</sentence><sentence id="1093">And the other thing that contributed to my feeling pretty bad was that we had <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturdays and my father didn't let me go.</sentence><sentence id="1094">And so, | was already really, you know, culturally deprived, | mean | was, | don't know how | managed to do well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because | did, but it was strictly grabbing things here and there and putting them together, but not having a coherent view of things.</sentence><sentence id="1095">It was, | missed, you know, a sixth of math every week, which was algebra and going on to, you know, higher math and |, | really, | had a lot of trouble catching up and staying afloat.</sentence><sentence id="1096">Missing one hour of Latin and one hour of Greek every week, and trying to make up, whereas the six hours, | mean the five hours that we had were hard enough, you know, to try then every week, by the time you catch on, there you go, you're missing three or four or five hours of really important work.</sentence><sentence id="1097">And then | had to go after Sabbath, pick up the work from these people who weren't very friendly, they let me in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but like barely, and try and copy it over.</sentence><sentence id="1098">| mean, it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">And then, when the Jewish holidays came on Monday and Tuesday, so now here we go, | miss Saturday, of course, Sunday no <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Sunday | can't go pick up the notes because Sunday the holiday starts early and we have to go through that routine of bathing and getting ready and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1101">And so by Wednesday, | mean you can imagine how | felt when | got to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1102">| mean, the people were talking about things | had absolutely no clue about and the teacher said, "Well, you know, you want to observe your religion, that's okay with me, but I'm not going to help you.</sentence><sentence id="1103">You'll just whatever, you know, do it yourself".</sentence><sentence id="1104">So we did, this girl and myself, and we had six miserable years.</sentence><sentence id="1105">But somewhere in between, in 1951, | believe it was, my father's immigration papers, he had applied to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1933, and of course, the Americans had no intention of saving a single Jew so they made sure he didn't get the papers and they figured by, like , in'51, he'd be dead.</sentence><sentence id="1106">But in "51, his number came up, and so this was in sort of the middle of the Korean war and there was big panic in Europe that this was going to turn up to be World War III.</sentence><sentence id="1107">And so my father said, "I'm not going to survive another war, | just, | will not be able to do that".</sentence><sentence id="1108">So we all left and we came here.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1228">Q: Just because they weren't Jewish or...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1230">A: Yeah, | think we were, they weren't Jewish and we had all these restrictions, you know, on going this and going that, and so it was very hard and they didn't understand any of it.</sentence><sentence id="1231">| mean they simply couldn't understand what we were talking about.</sentence><sentence id="1232">There were two, actually, | think that our first year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, | think we were somewhere near 60, divided in three groups, one that wasn't planning to go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, so they were not the Latin, Greek types and | think two who were going to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, so out of 40, nine graduated.</sentence><sentence id="1233">And out of those nine, there was these two Jewish girls, Nelsie(ph) and myself.</sentence><sentence id="1234">And two other girls that we have, that we did become friends with over the years.</sentence><sentence id="1235">And in fact, | think the Nelsie might still be in touch with at least one of them.</sentence><sentence id="1236">And | know where they are at least, you know, so it's not like they're totally lost.</sentence><sentence id="1237">But it took a long time, until something gelled.</sentence><sentence id="1238">And at the time that | left, it was about, | was beginning to feel a bit better and | knew Flemish by then, and | was, | was really doing very well.</sentence><sentence id="1239">And so it was a little difficult to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1240">But on the other hand, it was like a big adventure going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, you know, it was something terribly attractive.</sentence><sentence id="1241">And | did adjust, really, | mean | hated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1264">A: And the people who came to pick us up were, so my grandfather, | don't know, he had a number of siblings that, unfortunately, | only met one or two

is really not for me, so he learned English, it was very funny, my grandfather knew English.</sentence><sentence id="1267">And he went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but one brother and a sister, | think, stayed here.</sentence><sentence id="1268">So those people came to meet us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1269">Now, these people had been transplanted from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span>, essentially, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span>, | can't, yeah, those | think might have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1270">And they, okay.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1271">[end of side 1 of tape

mean it was just, really it was ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="1275">And my father was yelling at her.</sentence><sentence id="1276">And | was yelling at her.</sentence><sentence id="1277">But, she was always on the side of the, you know, the loser and the underdog and the, you know, you have to do this, you must do this, and what's the big deal, so we have one more suitcase.</sentence><sentence id="1278">Yes, ma, now 10 more suitcases.</sentence><sentence id="1279">And who's going to drag this?</sentence><sentence id="1280">And then you get here and you go, first of all immigration treats you like shit, that's number one.</sentence><sentence id="1281">| mean, really awful.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And you land on this <span class="DLF">pier</span> and these people appear who are primitive, in my view, because, see, even though my parents didn't have a formal education, my mother was anything but primitive, and the people who they associated with, again, had no education, but were very, they were street wise and they were, they had a veneer of worldliness about them because most them had been, they'd been to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, so they, they had a better, they had a much wider experience.</sentence><sentence id="1283">And they had to adjust very quickly, so many of them learned Spanish and then they learned French and then they learned German and they learned just to be able to stay alive and to function in those societies, so they had a veneer of worldliness, you know, and they had sort of, and they were very elegant, they had beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1284">These people here lived in these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with the, you know, the fire escapes.</sentence><sentence id="1285">And | had a totally different vision of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, which had been fed to me by the movies of the early 50's, you know, with these <span class="INT_SPACE">Hollywood apartments</span> and the little maids with the little white things.</sentence><sentence id="1286">And | took a look at this, | said, "My God, you know, this is awful".</sentence><sentence id="1287">| mean, I'd much rather be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> because that's really not me at all.</sentence><sentence id="1288">And the first thing these people would ask you is, "How do you like <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1289">You know, and having been just treated like garbage, | would say, "| hate <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>".</sentence><sentence id="1290">And my mother was furious.</sentence><sentence id="1291">And | mean, it was just a bad experience.</sentence><sentence id="1292">So we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough

rabbi who was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> for the winter because we came in the winter.</sentence><sentence id="1294">It happens that the rabbi's travel plans didn't work out quite as predicted, so here we come, four people and the rabbi and his wife with the wig, the little girl, you know, snotty nose, white socks, | mean, just, you know, from the ghetto, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, this is how it looked to me.</sentence><sentence id="1295">And we have to spend two nights with them in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1296">And there were roaches there and we had left our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, which was not luxurious, but compared to that, it was clearly <span class="BUILDING">Trump Tower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1297">And so, | felt very bad about this whole thing and when they left, you know, at least we got, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was ours and it became a little easier.</sentence><sentence id="1298">And in fact, then | started having a good time because my mother's brother who left, | told you, with his three , he left with his three kids on that last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, his daughter is about two years older than | am and she's wonderful, a really wonderful person.</sentence><sentence id="1299">And so she was really very welcoming to me and she took me with her friends, although it seemed to me she was from <span

any of the stuff she did.</sentence><sentence id="1301">| mean, she would, on Saturday night if she didn't have a date, she would not dare put her nose out the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and | would, "Look Renee(ph), let's go to the movies".</sentence><sentence id="1302">And she says, "No, we can't".</sentence><sentence id="1303">And | said, "Why not?"</sentence><sentence id="1304">And she wouldn't tell me, you know, because | was still maybe a little too young for her to, and she would have a bunch of friends, they'd come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they would do their hair and they would do all these stupid things and they wouldn't, and | couldn't, | was just, | couldn't understand, but | liked her a lot and so | had fun, | think it was almost like an

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1408">Q: You were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1410">A: Yes, that, we were living in one of those efficiency type <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> on West 72nd, | don't remember what it was called, it had a name, it was a sort of <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, <span class="BUILDING">apartment hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1411">And it was fine, | mean it was much better than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span> and, and | met a very nice young woman at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Julia Richmond</span> and she, she wanted absolutely to have me date, so she would introduce me.</sentence><sentence id="1412">She thought | was this incredible kid, you know, because | was very different from everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="1413">And she used to introduce me, these guys who were much older, who were, you know, from Yashiva(ph) University types.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And | didn't want <span class="BUILDING">Yashiva University</span> types.</sentence><sentence id="1415">The hat and the thing, but | mean, | dated a couple of times, you know, and | was very uncomfortable.</sentence><sentence id="1416">The dating situation was, wasn't me at all.</sentence><sentence id="1417">And then my mother said, you know, my father was having horrible headaches and he wasn't feeling well and she just couldn't get used to the anonymity and sort of lack of interaction and the fact that her brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span> and it became a whole hassle just to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Borough Park</span>, you know, everything was a hassle.</sentence><sentence id="1418">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, you can walk to most of your friend's and everything, you know, you can walk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> and you can do all your shopping on foot.</sentence><sentence id="1419">| mean, there is public transportation and people use it, but it's not like the noisy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> and, you know, all of that.</sentence><sentence id="1420">There's not that many, it's not crowdy and noisy and filthy and, you know, scary.</sentence><sentence id="1421">So we, we returned, we went back.</sentence><sentence id="1422">And that was, so, | think we got here probably around February and | started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the end of February and | was to graduate in June, but that would have been a real mistake.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1423">And went back in May, and of course, | had missed four months of Latin and Greek and trigonometry and | mean, horrors.</sentence><sentence id="1424">And so they said, "Look, you can repeat a year or you can try and cram".</sentence><sentence id="1425">So | said I'd try and cram.</sentence><sentence id="1426">And | did, | crammed.</sentence><sentence id="1427">And | failed only one subject and that was hist, not history, geography.</sentence><sentence id="1428">So they let me take a makeup and then that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1429">So | made it to my grade level and continued til the end and graduated in, can't remember what year, "55 | think.</sentence><sentence id="1430">Somewhere around there.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1433">Q: And then what happened?</sentence><sentence id="1434">What was it like going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, first?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1435">A: Well, yeah, by the time we left, | actually like it because, hey, as | said, | was graduating, | knew | didn't really know anything, but | thought | could fake it.</sentence><sentence id="1436">And | was dating, although | didn't like the scene, there was something kind of nice about it.</sentence><sentence id="1437">And | was becoming more independent.</sentence><sentence id="1438">So | don't think | was looking forward to going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="1439">| think | was, by that time, beginning to open up to the possibilities of much more freedom.</sentence><sentence id="1440">And the possibility of meeting a lot more people in may age group.</sentence><sentence id="1441">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> it was extremely restricted and, as | said, there were some that were going to these religious things which | wasn't going to go into.</sentence><sentence id="1442">There were some that were going to the non-religious one, | mean still the organized Zionist group, | couldn't join that because my father wouldn't let me and besides, as | said, I'm not sure | was that type.</sentence><sentence id="1443">And then there was a group of very rich kids, or at least acted as they were, as if they were very rich, and they were very sophisticated and had their hair done in nice <span class="NPIP">places</span> and we couldn't afford that.</sentence><sentence id="1444">So | wasn't really comfortable with them either.</sentence><sentence id="1445">So | was quite isolated and had just, and then the pressure was on to just get married.</sentence><sentence id="1446">In all those groups, you know, and | mean | couldn't deal with this at all.</sentence><sentence id="1447">| simply couldn't deal with this.</sentence><sentence id="1448">So | had two or three friends, girlfriends mostly, til the end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1449">And we'd just meet in each other's <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and commiserate, basically.</sentence><sentence id="1450">Complain about how terrible life was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1451">And so that's how it was until | graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1452">And a time, about, when | was studying for my big finals in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, it was around the holiday of Pentecost, you know, , my, one of my uncles, Myer, you know, who had lived with us, and his wife had taken an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for the month of June at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seashore</span> and they invited me to come for that holiday.</sentence><sentence id="1453">So | came and | brought all my books to study my final exams.</sentence><sentence id="1454">And | was studying on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> because it, it was the month of June and it was not high season yet, there were just families with young children.</sentence><sentence id="1455">And this one guy, you know, approached me and he was a young man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, but just a few years older than | was.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And we started dating.</sentence><sentence id="1457">So then | had sort of a good time for awhile except that he wanted to get married.</sentence><sentence id="1458">And | just didn't want to.</sentence><sentence id="1459">| mean, | just did not.</sentence><sentence id="1460">You know, | just knew that | had to hang onto what | had said and | wasn't going to cave in.</sentence><sentence id="1461">And so that, didn't have a nice ending, but | started <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1664">A: Well, again, you know, | was sort of an, essentially because | was a con artist, you know, and like | faked my way through <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, | faked my way through <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>, | more or less faked my way through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, faked my way through, you know, to graduate here, | mean it was all, | knew enough to put together something that looked fine, but it was really not fine in depth.</sentence><sentence id="1665">And so, this one person | knew who is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, Mimi(ph), she, she lost her father during the war and she and her brother and mother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and Mimi is still a very strong individual and she decided there was no future for them at all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and so they were going to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1666">And they did.</sentence><sentence id="1667">And she worked as an office manager for a man who is American who had this business in scrap plastics, so he'd buy plastics from <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and he would sell them all over Europe and | guess they would recycle them essentially.</sentence><sentence id="1668">And so he was a German Jew who lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and he would come every summer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> to sort of oversee his business, the rest of the time, she was running the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1669">So, | took that job.</sentence><sentence id="1670">| knew nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1671">He could only speak German, this man, and we'd correspond in German and, or some English, but mostly German.</sentence><sentence id="1672">| needed to do accounting and | didn't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1673">| needed to sell stuff and quabble over the price and | hate, | mean | was 19, you know, | had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="1674">But somehow she trained me in a couple of months to, again, present a credible picture, not, not really knowing what | was doing but enough to, and | remember clearly, clients coming in and they were looking for the boss, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1675">| said, "Well, | represent him".</sentence><sentence id="1676">And they were like, "Oh, my God, you know, what is this?"</sentence><sentence id="1677">Because | looked very, very young, very young.</sentence><sentence id="1678">| mean now maybe, | look my age, but then | didn't, | really, | looked 15 at the most, at the most, and that was stretching it because | couldn't get into movies where you had to be 17 without ID, | mean they wouldn't let me in at all.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And so, but I, | really did an okay job, you know, | didn't lose the man any money, maybe | didn't do as well as someone who really knew what they were doing, but | managed the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and there was two secretaries and there was a like chief accountant, but | had to present the stuff in the way that this person could, and | was their boss, which was really laughable.</sentence><sentence id="1680">But | did it, | did it fora year and then | said this is clearly not my avocation.</sentence><sentence id="1681">And | told my mother that | was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to study because | couldn't do it in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> because | wasn't going to be able to, this commuting business wasn't for me.</sentence><sentence id="1682">And she supported me, you know, she supported me.</sentence><sentence id="1683">And | left for <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, not knowing at all what | was going to do, not knowing anybody there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1705">Q: You'd been accepted into <span class="BUILDING">med school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1707">A: No, | didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span>, | wasn't accepted into anything, | just took my luggage, | went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night train</span>, | got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at six in the morning with coffers and coffers, you know, because my mother had packed God knows what, and stood there and had no idea where to go.</sentence><sentence id="1708">And finally managed to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and there was a Jewish , as I've figured, well, I'll go there.</sentence><sentence id="1709">At least somewhere to park my stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1710">And | did, went there, and put my stuff and immediately figured that | didn't want to stay there for very long because it was one of these orthodox things again and | said, "That's really lovely, I'll stay a couple of nights, but I'm not staying".</sentence><sentence id="1711">And so there were some other students there, obviously, and they helped me find a, you know, they helped me through the ropes of getting a newspaper and finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1712">And | found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1713">And then | went to <span class="BUILDING">register</span> and, honestly, | didn't know for what.</sentence><sentence id="1714">| really didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1715">And I'm standing on <span class="DLF">line</span>, you know, in front of the register, you know, the teller essentially.</sentence><sentence id="1716">And there was these two Swiss girls and they're talking and we started talking, | asked them what are you registering for, and they said, "Oh, we're going for a degree in biology".</sentence><sentence id="1717">| said, "Okay, I'll do that, too".</sentence><sentence id="1718">| mean, it sounds really idiotic, but that's how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1719">So | went and | got a degree in biology.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1721">Tape 3</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1722">A: And so we registered, the three of us, and we became really good friends, in fact, I'm still friends with them now.</sentence><sentence id="1723">Once every two or three months, she'll give me a call, just out of the blue, one of them, the other, then | hear from this, from the second one, , just Christiana(ph) is the one that I've kept in touch with, but | always hear about Christiana.</sentence><sentence id="1724">And that's how | started a biology degree and somewhere in the midst of all of that | met my husband.</sentence><sentence id="1725">| met one woman who is an Israeli and I'm still very friendly with her, in fact, she called me on Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="1726">And she was in the <span class="BUILDING">interpreter school</span>, oh yeah, that's the other thing, all the girls who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> were in interpreters.</sentence><sentence id="1727">| didn't want to do that because | still had my views on a real job, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1728">And something that | was interested in.</sentence><sentence id="1729">So biology was just, just great.</sentence><sentence id="1730">My friend that | met, Elana(ph), was an Israeli woman who was just a lot of fun, she's a great gal.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And she was in <span class="BUILDING">interpreter school</span>, so we became really good friends and | had these two Swiss girls, Christiana and Josiana(ph), and we became good friends.</sentence><sentence id="1732">So immediately | had a group of friends.</sentence><sentence id="1733">And so, of course, my parents were very worried about, is she ever going to get married.</sentence><sentence id="1734">And | said, "Look, I'm going to study, | don't know what I'm going to study, but I'm going to study something and I'm not getting married".</sentence><sentence id="1735">So they were very upset because there had been several candidates in between that | didn't mention from this fellow whom | met at age 17.</sentence><sentence id="1736">There was a bunch of them and | didn't like any of them, | always had an excuse.</sentence><sentence id="1737">And one was even a physician and, because | said, well this is uneducated, this is this, this is that, what's with the doctor?</sentence><sentence id="1738">You know.</sentence><sentence id="1739">| said, "I just don't love him.</sentence><sentence id="1740">That's it.</sentence><sentence id="1741">| don't love him.</sentence><sentence id="1742">I'm not marrying somebody | don't love and that's that".</sentence><sentence id="1743">So, they were getting really concerned and by that time | was 21, 22, and this is really getting to be the old maid.</sentence><sentence id="1744">So everybody was concocting, you know, to have me meet men.</sentence><sentence id="1745">So unbeknownst to me, there were relatives of his in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> who, he had relatives there who he used to come and visit for holidays and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1746">They told him about me, about this nice Jewish girl and, you know, when you're 22 and somebody tells you, nice Jewish girl, you say, oh, yeah, right.</sentence><sentence id="1747">The same family told me about him and | said, "Anybody who needs to be introduced by his uncle, | don't even want to know about".</sentence><sentence id="1748">So, but | didn't say anything, | said, "Oh yeah, really".</sentence><sentence id="1749">And | knew some of, there were a lot of American students studying medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1750">Those who were essentially there because they were Jews because there was clearly a quota of not admitting Jews to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1751">So they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and he was one of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1782">Q: So he's American?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1784">A: Well, he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, came here during the war, went back with his family, of course, in 1946, but for some reason or other, his parents couldn't get used to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> again, they went back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1785">So he was essentially raised here from the age of four on.</sentence><sentence id="1786">Went to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia College</span>, did extremely well, but for the quota reason didn't make it into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> right away, they wanted him to wait another year, it was very complicated, he said, screw you, I'm going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1787">So he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1788">And so this is how people were kind of planning to get us together.</sentence><sentence id="1789">So | knew some of the other medical students who were there and | told, so | must say, | had seen Sylvan(ph) and | didn't know who he was, but he was really handsome.</sentence><sentence id="1790">And | said, gee, and he looked totally non-Jewish, blue eyes, light hair, just what | needed.</sentence><sentence id="1791">And so | really wanted to meet him.</sentence><sentence id="1792">And | told someone, "Do you know this guy <span class="BUILDING">Sylvan Kleinhaus</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="1793">He said, "Yeah, he's in, you know, my medical".</sentence><sentence id="1794">| said, "Just point him out to me because | want to make sure that | don't meet him".</sentence><sentence id="1795">So next time we are in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> together, he says, "That's him".</sentence><sentence id="1796">| says, "No".</sentence><sentence id="1797">So he said, "Yes," he said, "Why no?"</sentence><sentence id="1798">| said, "Oh, that's a long story, I'm not telling you why".</sentence><sentence id="1799">So we met and interestingly enough, he knew my friend Elana, separately, independently.</sentence><sentence id="1800">And so we became really, the three of us, you know, very close and she was dating another medical student at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1801">And so we met and we started to date and we got married about a year later.</sentence><sentence id="1802">Even though | said, I'm not getting married.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1823">Q: Did you have a religious ceremony?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1825">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1826">Well, that | didn't mind, you know, that I, see | will go for the form, | still, I'll go, | go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> now and | attend on the high holidays and | bitch throughout the entire thing, but it's, but | am, it's an ethnic identification.</sentence><sentence id="1827">| feel in some ways, extremely Jewish, | have very, very strong feelings for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, my brother lives there and his family.</sentence><sentence id="1828">My brother who was born in 1946, with his children and | love his family.</sentence><sentence id="1829">And all, practically all the cousins that were born to these people who lived with us, as | told you, they all live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1830">And, and | went there for one summer after | graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, so | really took a love for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1831">For a variety of reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And | think that's probably where the war has marked me the most, is that | feel so strongly identified as a Jew and | cannot stand it when anybody makes any kind of comment, you know, about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or Jews or, it just makes me completely crazy, even though | don't agree with everything that the Israeli government does and it's not like I'm a totally right wing fanatic, not at all, but | just can't stand criticism from people who aren't Jewish, | just cannot.</sentence><sentence id="1833">| always feel that it's tainted, that is" not strictly on political grounds.</sentence><sentence id="1834">So to that extent maybe | have a certain amount of paranoia that | can trace back to the war.</sentence><sentence id="1835">| mean, maybe that's where it's most visible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1847">Q: You went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1928">Q: Of what <span class="NPIP">year</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1930">A: 1960.</sentence><sentence id="1931">A long time ago.</sentence><sentence id="1932">And we, the summer, we came here because he had wanted to transfer to an <span class="BUILDING">American medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1933">And he got several interviews.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1934">His parents lived on West 96th and Central, not Central, <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1935">And we were married in April and | did not want to go live with his parents.</sentence><sentence id="1936">And they couldn't understand it.</sentence><sentence id="1937">So we, domineering people, particularly the father, and | insisted that we move to our own <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1938">| said, "| don't care if it's a <span class="DLF">hole</span>, but a <span class="NPIP">place</span> of our own".</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1939">And we did, they did get us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the Windermere (ph) Hotel, which was west something or other, 90, 91st, I'm not sure, and <span class="DLF">Broadway</span>, | think it was.</sentence><sentence id="1940">Or, yeah, | think it was Broadway.</sentence><sentence id="1941">But we, it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1942">| came here, he started to do some externships (ph) and interviewing in <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and then | said, | wasn't, | didn't finish, | mean | was still, had | think a year or two to go.</sentence><sentence id="1943">And | started looking at various <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> to see how | could continue what | was doing.</sentence><sentence id="1944">And it looked extremely difficult because the curriculum wasn't the same and over there it was only science, but here in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, you needed all these core courses of English, literature and so on and |, really had already lost two years of <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, one year of working, | didn't want to start, | was on the <span class="DLF">track</span> and | just didn't want to get off it now.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1945">So we had some difficult times right after we got married because to him it was certainly much more enticing to transfer to a <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, get an American degree and have not to deal with any of this foreign business.</sentence><sentence id="1946">But to me, it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1947">And also, | must tell you that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> was, and perhaps still is, but it was <span class="NPIP">paradise on

you know, lunchtime we'd go and swim, we'd take boat rides, we'd go up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1950">| mean, his parents were very wealthy so he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and | mean, we just had a life, the best life, you know, no responsibilities except to our studies.</sentence><sentence id="1951">And really enjoy life, for me, almost | would say for the first time, really, really enjoying my life.</sentence><sentence id="1952">| mean, | had had moments, you know, that | had a good time and when | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> | had a good time and when | went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> | had a good time and here and there | had a good time, but |

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1956">A: | think probably by the time | got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> | sort of had that straightened out.</sentence><sentence id="1957">| became, you know, happy and | stopped, maybe I, | still, I'm still nasty to people | don't like.</sentence><sentence id="1958">| mean, | have a certain level of tolerance, but once that's exceeded I, | think I'll go absolutely through fire for people that | love, | mean | will leave no stone unturned and | will, you Know, even harm myself, but | will not, | have very little tolerance for people that | don't tolerate, so, when they reach the point where | can't take them any more, there is almost no, there's almost no return.</sentence><sentence id="1959">So I'm not tolerant, I'm very intolerant.</sentence><sentence id="1960">But I'm not nasty.</sentence><sentence id="1961">Not anymore, | don't think I'm, | don't think people think I'm nasty, but | am not very
