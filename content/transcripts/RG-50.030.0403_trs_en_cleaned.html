<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: No, the -- the first time I was aware that there was something different if you are a Jew, was when I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, and we went for a parade, and then, although we came to the staging point quite early, we had to wait and I didn't like that.</sentence><sentence id="82">So I told the teacher why are we waiting, and other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> have come after us and they pass.</sentence><sentence id="83">And the teacher, who happened</sentence><sentence id="85">to be a Christian, said we are the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, that's why we have to wait.</sentence><sentence id="86">So I realized that being a Jew was not a good thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="107">Q: There were very few Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: That's correct, there were only 40 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span>, while there were almost 2000 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>, so there was a big difference.</sentence><sentence id="110"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> was called also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vrahori</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Evraiohori</span>, which means a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">Why?</sentence><sentence id="112">Because in 1821, there were 200 Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">And what happened to these 200 Jewish families, I think has significant meaning and it explains in my opinion why there were so few Greek righteous Gentiles in the second World War.</sentence><sentence id="114">I counted in the Yad Vashem list something like 124 names plus 40 spouses.</sentence><sentence id="115">And in my experience, I know of 12 other righteous Gentiles who should be in that list, and they are not.</sentence><sentence id="116">But still the numbers are very small.</sentence><sentence id="117">And then, in addition to that, the losses of the Greek Jews were great.</sentence><sentence id="118">89 percent were transported outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and 87 percent were killed, or 67,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="119">So what happened in 1821 was a very little known historic event.</sentence><sentence id="120">The Turks killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> the Greek patriarch of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constantinople</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">And they forced four Jewish porters to throw his body to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">When this became known to what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was much smaller</sentence><sentence id="124">than it is now, the 5000 Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> were massacred.</sentence><sentence id="125">A few who survived were converted to Christianity.</sentence><sentence id="126">One of the leaders of the Greek nation, Kanellos Deligiannis was a great righteous Gentile of that period, and he saved 12 Jews whom he hid in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tripolitsa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">The anti- Jewish feelings of the population were so strong that Deligiannis was forced to keep these 12 Jews hidden in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for three years.</sentence><sentence id="128">And only in 1824 he was able to secretly move them to the Ionian Island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zakinthos</span> which it was not then under Greek control.</sentence><sentence id="129">So, going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> and the 40 Jews, these people have come mainly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">There were many small merchants and one of them was a teacher who during the war became one of the five leaders of the resistance in our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">His name was Yunas Munis.</sentence><sentence id="132">I would say about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinio</span> has the distinct honor of being possibly the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="REGION">German occupied Europe</span> where all the Jews did not obey any German regulations and they all survived.</sentence><sentence id="133">And I really can't think of any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where something like that happened, but I should say that we were very fortunate that we did not have a rabbi, and we did not have any community leaders, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> the rabbis and community leaders, with one or two very rare exceptions proved to be totally incapable of facing the problems that the German occupation presented.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Did you -- did you move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> before the Italians attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: That -- that -- that's correct, the -- we moved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> sometime in March of 1940, and yeah, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> on October 28", 1940.</sentence><sentence id="164">About this war I would like to say that the Jewish -- Greek Jewish participation was great.</sentence><sentence id="165">Out of 77,000 Jews, 12,800 were -- served in the army, and that included my father and many of my relatives.</sentence><sentence id="166">Over 500 were killed, including a cousin of my mother's.</sentence><sentence id="167">Over 3,700 were wounded, including at least two or three of our relatives.</sentence><sentence id="168">To these numbers I would like to add the 1,600 Jewish Palestinian volunteers who served with the British expeditionary force.</sentence><sentence id="169">And one of them was the father of the former Prime</sentence><sentence id="171">Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, Shimon Peres, and he was not able to be evacuated with the British and he became a partisan of ELAS.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: I would like also to say that the greatest Greek hero of the second World War was a Greek Jewish colonel, Mordechai Frizis, who, with his troops, stopped the Italian advance, giving the allies their first victory of the second World War.</sentence><sentence id="186">Mordechai Frizis was killed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: I don't know when this happened, you joined a national youth organization that was actually a fascist organization --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Ah, yes, that -- that's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: -- can you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: -- that's quite --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: -- talk about that some?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: -- yes.</sentence><sentence id="196">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> we were only two Jewish boys among 1,000 students in the -- the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">And I'm grateful to the people who were in charge, because every able bodied boy was a member of the youth -- the fascist youth organization.</sentence><sentence id="198">And I'm grateful to them for not knowing that Jews were not allowed to join that fascist organization, or knowingly they allowed us to join them.</sentence><sentence id="199">I know that I was going around giving the fascist salute f -- until the war started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: And why were you glad that no one kicked you out, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Because I never liked to be discriminated against.</sentence><sentence id="207">So being a fascist suit me fine, although I did not realize that it was so bad at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: And what were you doing in the organization?</sentence><sentence id="209">O -- th-they obviously didn't talk about Jews or do racial things, did they?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: No, no, they -- they did not.</sentence><sentence id="216">They -- w-we would parade, we would -- we -- we had lectures about Greek nationalism.</sentence><sentence id="217">Th-There was nothing offensive as far as I know at that time, you know, about th-this organization.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: So you were about 10 years old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: And how long were you in that group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Until October 1940.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: So when the Italians attacked?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Yes, then the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> actually closed, and we were very glad that the classes ended, without realizing what the war meant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: So <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed in October --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: -- or November.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: And a -- when the war started it closed, and then it started again in -- in other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, some <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span>, because the <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span> were used as <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: So did you then go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: And with the same teachers and the same kids?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Yes, everything the same.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: So the fact that there were two Jewish students in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, the Italians did not kick out the Jewish students?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: The Italians?</sentence><sentence id="250">F-First of all, remember that the war started on October 28", but the -- and the Germans attacked in April of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="251">Only after that time the Germans first, and the Italians</sentence><sentence id="253">second, came.</sentence><sentence id="254">The Italians were excellent in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">While in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> the 50,000 Jews lost their civil rights in 1938 with Mussolini's Aryan manif -- manifesto, in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, thanks to the Italian commander general Carlo Geroso, we enjoyed all civil liberties.</sentence><sentence id="256">The -- we were able to -- to go to -- to the -- to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, while the Italians were not able to do that.</sentence><sentence id="257">Actually there were 94 Italian university professors who were dismissed, five Italian Jewish admirals, and five Italian Jewish generals who were dismissed.</sentence><sentence id="258">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> we enjoyed all freedom and Carlo Geroso refused to cooperate with General Lohr, Alexander Lohr, the German general in the persecution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="259">So we were very happy with the Italians, and we -- we lived a very normal life in the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span>, business was as usual, we went to the movies, and my mother was making cookies which a neighbor of hers, Maria Demardi used to send to <span class="BUILDING">partisan hospitals</span>, once the partisan movement became stronger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: So between 1940 and 1942, life does not change very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Life was absolutely beautiful for us under the -- under the Italians.</sentence><sentence id="276">And there -- there was one moment that the Italians asked us to register, and none thought anything of it, and they registered, and I know of only one person from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> who did not trust the Italians, only one.</sentence><sentence id="277">And he took his parents and went into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="278">Th-That's how he survived later on the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="279">But we registered.</sentence><sentence id="280">And -- I'm ashamed to say that.</sentence><sentence id="281">And 30 years later I found out that Mussolini made a deal with the Germans that they were supposed to -- to arrest us, and move us to camps in the <span class="REGION">Ionian Islands</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">But of course, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> capitulated and this did not happen, but the Germans came.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: You know, you wrote in your book that you, at first the family, it seemed, had hoped that the Germans would occupy rather than the Italians because you thought they would be better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: That's another unfortunate kind of thinking in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, but remember that in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at least 30 to 40 percent of population were pro-German.</sentence><sentence id="300">That's a significant number.</sentence><sentence id="301">And because the -- the Greeks defeated the Italians in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, we were afraid that the Italians might come there and be vindictive, while the -- the Germans actually did not find significant resistance because many Greek generals were pro-German.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: So you were surprised?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: We were surprised that the Italians behaved in such a nice way.</sentence><sentence id="305">I have to say that the Germans behaved very well too, when they entered our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: And they entered your <span class="REGION">area</span> in April of nin -- deg43?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="311">Sometime at the end of April, 40 -- 41.</sentence><sentence id="312">Only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> they did not behave well, but in our <span class="REGION">area</span> they passed through and they did not bother anybody.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: But your -- your <span class="REGION">area</span> was the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: [happened to be -- because my father was mobilized, we were in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> when the Germans came in first.</sentence><sentence id="319">And they behaved very well, they did not bother anybody, although the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> of 2,000 approximately, people existed there, and they -- they ju -- simply passed.</sentence><sentence id="320">And then the Italians came, and they behaved very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: So you moved back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Yes, from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>, once my father became a civilian again, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrini</span>, and my father went back to his <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">In other words, the Germans passed through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="327">Q: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">741</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: In "41, and since this was the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> of occupation, they did not stay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: The Italians were in charge until September of 1943.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="552">A: We rented.</sentence><sentence id="553">We rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">This -- we had with us plenty of money.</sentence><sentence id="555">My father unfortunately had only cash.</sentence><sentence id="556">He did not have any gold, that was a big mistake, because thanks to inflation, the money lost

Jews.</sentence><sentence id="559">As a matter of fact we were going to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday because we didn't want the -- the people to think that we were different, with the exception of the fact that we would not make the sign of the cross, or eat the wafers, or the pieces of bread that y-you know, a -- a Christian is supposed to -- to have at the end of the service.</sentence><sentence id="560">So with the exception of that, we were very friendly with the priest, who used to come to my mother's place because we were the only ones who had coffee, and he liked to have coffee.</sentence><sentence id="561">And the life was beautiful, and the -- it was li-like a vacation, until the Germans came.</sentence><sentence id="562">When they came, we -- by now we were f-four of us, and two, six, we were nine -- four, seven -- we became 10 Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">And we decided, and the people of the resistance told us that we should go higher up, and they told us that there is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> very high up in the mountain of 300 feet, and</sentence><sentence id="565">5 you should go there and stay there.</sentence><sentence id="566">So there were only two little donkeys that could be used for -- for supplies.</sentence><sentence id="567">So we loaded a little donkey, but un-unfortunately we had to leave all our supplies in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="568">And we went to the -- to the top of the -- of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of [indecipherable] and we stayed there, and the Germans stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for -- I -- I should add that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy, a socialite from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> decided she had enough, she wasn't going to go any -- any further, and she stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="569">And she spoke fluently German and French.</sentence><sentence id="570">And she spoke with the

and it didn't take long and the Germans left, and we came back.</sentence><sentence id="572">When we came back, we found out that we lost all our supplies.</sentence><sentence id="573">Now, the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, who has a reputation as a thief claimed that it was the Germans who took it, who took everything.</sentence><sentence id="574">My mother went right into their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and searched and she found some of our items.</sentence><sentence id="575">The -- later on we found out when the villagers made the report as to how -- what things they lost, it was mainly bottles of Ouzo, bottles of wine, and they would say, with the entire bottle.</sentence><sentence id="576">Because for them the bottle was more precious than the contents of Ouzo and wine, which they could make by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="577">Therefore, I'm convinced that it was this man, [indecipherable] who was the thief, and not the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="578">But we knew that the partisans, in order to establish some sort of tranquility and -- and e-eliminate [indecipherable] and fear, they have killed even a partisan who stole a -- a chicken.</sentence><sentence id="579">And therefore, we decided to keep quiet, not to report him [indecipherable] the family.</sentence><sentence id="580">We wouldn't want to be responsible for an execution.</sentence><sentence id="581">And we thought, well, we have more supplies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> and we will bring them.</sentence><sentence id="582">Unfortunately we were not able to bring as many supplies as we needed, so we had some starvation later on.</sentence><sentence id="583">Now, the fact that Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy decided to stay and the Germans were very polite, turned against us the following month, because the Germans made three attempts at research -- at</sentence><sentence id="585">6 search and destroy operations.</sentence><sentence id="586">In November, in December, and in the following August.</sentence><sentence id="587">So, in December there was another alarm that the Germans were approaching.</sentence><sentence id="588">This time, Mrs.[indecipherable] Levy persuaded my mother that the Germans are not dangerous they behaved so well.</sentence><sentence id="589">My mother didn't like the idea of going up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, but also, she didn't want to abandon our supplies for fear that -- that they will be stolen again, although we had to change <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> because this man not only he resented the fact that we called him a thief, especially after we found things hidden in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but he asked us to leave because we insulted him.</sentence><sentence id="590">He didn't realize that we saved his life.</sentence><sentence id="591">And we moved to another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we also rented.</sentence><sentence id="592">So my mother decided to -- to help Mrs. [indecipherable] Levy in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, since the knew German so well, and -- and stay there.</sentence><sentence id="593">But a neighbor who saw that, told the lady -- she was a -- a [indecipherable] a former policeman and his son was a partisan and he told them, what makes you believe that there will be the same Germans, or they will became -- they will be just as polite as they were before, or they might not have orders to ar-arrest you as suspicious individuals.</sentence><sentence id="594">So she forced them to come up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain lake</span> with it, but fortunately the Germans did not come this second time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="595">Are you curious about what happened the third time, in August?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="645">Q: Well, did anything happen in between?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="647">A: In--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: Between February and August?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="649">A: -- in between, with the exception that we faced starvation because the -- the war between the Germans and the partisans intensified, and while before it was so easy to get in and out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, it became more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="650">So the end result was that -- that it was not easy to send a villager in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> where my father had stored his supplies and get from a -- one his friends</sentence><sentence id="652">7 there, who was -- he was -- it's -- it's hard to understand that, but the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> was trying to help the employees even with food supplies.</sentence><sentence id="653">So one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> had food, and an employee would take care of food distribution to the employees of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="654">So this man also had our supplies with instructions when my father would send a man to get whatever we wanted, but this source was -- was lost.</sentence><sentence id="655">So we -- we really suffered from -- from starvation.</sentence><sentence id="656">I mean, but this is not -- this is the least that can happen to you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="667">Q: But what kinds of things were you able then to eat?</sentence><sentence id="668">This was true of a lot of people in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> at this time, right, that this was very bad --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="669">A: Well, not -- not -- not -- it was -- it was bad only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, not in the provinces.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="670">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="672">A: The provi -- provinces had plenty of food, and people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> would come to the <span class="COUNTRY">provinces</span> to get food.</sentence><sentence id="673">In -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, as long as we were not [indecipherable] there was no problem, it was like peacetime.</sentence><sentence id="674">I mean, you had as much food as you wanted.</sentence><sentence id="675">Only when we lost our supplies and we were not able to get the quantities that we needed, only then -- we had basically to eat a lot of wild vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="676">I had -- that was my job.</sentence><sentence id="677">I had to go, with a knife, and get anything that was green on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, that the animals would not eat because they were -- these things were bitter.</sentence><sentence id="678">And then my mother would boil these things and mix them with a little corn flour and she would put just enough oil on the -- on the big, big pot, and cook them.</sentence><sentence id="679">I found out eventually that this cellulose can be absorbed by the body.</sentence><sentence id="680">So basically, that's what kept us alive, because we could eat enormous quantities of these because I would get, you know, bi-big quantities and we would eat that.</sentence><sentence id="681">Basically, that's what th -- that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="682">The one thing I can say is that at -- what helped us at one point was the fact that a partisan unit came to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">And we told them that we were starving.</sentence><sentence id="684">And they</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="688">8 offered to de -- I mean, they -- at -- at night, when they had their meetings, all the partisans voted in favor of giving us a -- a portion.</sentence><sentence id="689">And also to the family of [indecipherable] Levy.</sentence><sentence id="690">And -- and when the -- the trumpet would -- would sound, I would go in <span class="DLF">line</span> and get a portion -- the partisans were not fed very well either, mainly th-they had a corn soup.</sentence><sentence id="691">That's -- that was -- and a few olives.</sentence><sentence id="692">But we would divide that portion that was for one man, we would divide it into four.</sentence><sentence id="693">And in this way, w -- for the duration of their s -- their stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> which was maybe 20 - 25 days, we did not touch our supplies.</sentence><sentence id="694">That proved to be very, very important because ultimately we did not have anything.</sentence><sentence id="695">And on that day, one of the men of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- actually he was the leader of the reserve ELAS, he -- he told me to -- to go and collect berries, and by that time there were berries, as many as you wanted.</sentence><sentence id="696">And I did.</sentence><sentence id="697">We ate berries for four days and we all became sick.</sentence><sentence id="698">At that point we didn't know what to do because the [indecipherable] production was going to come within days, but not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, which was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="699">So my mother and I took the last supply that we had, which was sugar, and we went down, we crossed the <span

exchanged sugar, which nobody had, for [indecipherable], which was some cereal that had milk.</sentence><sentence id="701">And that was the turning point in -- in our food situation.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="702">Once the time came that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> had produced -- had -- had a lot of things, i-i-in the meantime we -- we realized what we had to do, but that's a little -- it's a little -- another story, because we had -- well, where to find parachute material, but this happened accidentally.</sentence><sentence id="703">When e -- in April, or at the beg -- at the end of March, my mother decided that she sh -- would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> and get supplies.</sentence><sentence id="704">And my father and myself -- I-I was at that time 13 going on 14, my sister was only five to six, so my father an-and myself told her not to go, but she was very str -- opinionated and she decided to go.</sentence><sentence id="705">And she walked for practically 12 hours to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="709">9 And at one point she had to cross a -- a -- a <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, and one of the guards there was a partisan -- a Jewish partisan [indecipherable] from Arta, that my mother knew him.</sentence><sentence id="710">And he told her, don't you know that the -- the -- the Jews have been arrested, and they are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> in <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Papapetrou</span>?</sentence><sentence id="711">Of course my mother did not know anything, but she -- I have to say that before that my mother was stopped by a -- a teacher of mine who recognized her, and he told her, where are you going?</sentence><sentence id="712">Don't you know that the Jews have been arrested, and in addition, don't you know that the Germans executed some 200 Christian hostages because of the war that takes place between the Germans and the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="713">And my mother said that -- of course she felt very bad, and sick about -- hearing about the Jews, but she was determined, and she said, I have to go, I have to get food.</sentence><sentence id="714">So the -- the teacher said, why don't you go until the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that is very close to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, and -- and stop there at the <span class="DLF">mailbox</span>, and th-this is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a godfather of mine, and he is a teacher in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="715">You tell them that I sent you, and send him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to get the food.</sentence><sentence id="716">So my mother explained to the partisan [indecipherable] that this is my plan, and I'm not going to go beyond this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, which was in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, and he let her go, and that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="717">She met the teacher.</sentence><sentence id="718">The teacher went with his horse to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="719">He happened to be a godf -- he was a godfather of the director of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> -- this is a tremendous coincidence considering that [indecipherable] is the director of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, was supposed to be a descendant of the families which were converted in 1821.</sentence><sentence id="720"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Svordis</span> was a common Jewish name in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="721"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Svordis</span> could have been also one of the -- the convert families.</sentence><sentence id="722">And my father claims that even the intermediary between the two of them, Zambaris, that was the nickname of the Levy family of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">So, it -- it's a -- an amazing coincidence to have all these three people being godfathers to each other, and been involved in helping my mother at this point.</sentence><sentence id="724">Now, when he went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> with the horse in front of it, the director</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="728">0 became terrified.</sentence><sentence id="729">I mean th-th-th -- under these conditions, getting food on a horse that is going to go outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the whole <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> can be considered guilty of doing something wrong, as far as the Germans and their collaborators, and there were plenty by that time.</sentence><sentence id="730">There were the security -- Greek security battalions active at that time.</sentence><sentence id="731">So the only thing we were able to get thanks to that expedition was some quinine and some sugar and some tea that could be placed in the pocket of -- and when the man came back, he was not satisfied to leave my mother there, it was a-approaching nighttime when neither the partisans would allow anybody to move, nor the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="732">So he proposed to my mother that they should go to sleep in a small <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that his grandfather had built of prophet Elia.</sentence><sentence id="733">Even that to me is significant.</sentence><sentence id="734">And [indecipherable] went and zamp -- Zambaris -- that's name, Zambaris and my mother spent the night in that little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> where it was cold, and the wind was blowing.</sentence><sentence id="735">Then the following day, my mother came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="736">When she told us what was -- what happened, o-of course she was exhausted, you know, a-after 24 hours and -- and the trauma of knowing, a-and -- because they made a mistake and they told her that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> were also there, which means that all our relatives were there.</sentence><sentence id="737">So she was really a wreck.</sentence><sentence id="738">But in spite of that, she wanted to go on another expedition in which the British mission which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priansa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="739">That time we were assured that as soon as the allies would know that the Jews were arrested, they would immediately mobilize all their know-how and all their means at their disposal and the Jews would be s-set free.</sentence><sentence id="740">So again my mother -- you see, my -- my father had some problems, he had some pain with his legs, and he couldn't walk at that time.</sentence><sentence id="741">So my mother again, and myself, we embarked on an expedition of approximately a total of 14 hours of hiking in unknown <span class="REGION">territory</span>, crossing and re-crossing two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="742">That means four times crossing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> to go there.</sentence><sentence id="743">And we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priansa</span> where we had a meeting with a British major who -- his friend, a --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="747">1 a prostitute who was there told us -- well, I-I should say this, passing on the way there, we had to stop in a -- i-in a controlled partisan point, which was manned by our banker from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrini</span>.</sentence><sentence id="748">And he told us [indecipherable] we -- we told him what was our mission, what we wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="749">And he told us to go to this lady.</sentence><sentence id="750">There were other prostitutes there who were so-called working for the British mission.</sentence><sentence id="751">And he told us that this particular girl was the girlfriend of the British major, but evidently, she was also in contact with the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="752">And he told my mother to go to her and she will be able to talk to the -- to the major so the major will -- would be a little bit better to us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="753">But when we went there and we found her, the first thing that she did when she saw how I was dressed, because I was -- I was wearing my short fascist uniform, a blue uniform that it was strong material, but because my legs were exposed, my mother had s -- had sewn or attached to them some woolen leggings.</sentence><sentence id="754">So I was dressed like that.</sentence><sentence id="755">Soon as she saw that, she gave me the leftover [indecipherable] khaki pair of wi -- winter khaki pants that she had cut them to make shorts out of them, and she gave us the leftover, you know, so my mother can make some -- a better pair of pants for me.</sentence><sentence id="756">And she said that she had an argument with the major and he was not in a good mood.</sentence><sentence id="757">But nevertheless, the -- the m-major saw us, and he was very nice, and he knew French so my mother spoke to him in French.</sentence><sentence id="758">And he promised to send a message to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, and a -- a message to my father's sister who lived at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">But we know that the message in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> never went.</sentence><sentence id="760">But we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, we realized that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was filled with parachute material because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were coming at night and they were dropping weapons and ammunition for the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="761">And there was plen-plenty of parachute material.</sentence><sentence id="762">So my mother went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she begged these villagers, who

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="778">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="779">Beginning Tape Two</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="782">Q: Mike, why were the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> going into hiding at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: We found out about it much later.</sentence><sentence id="785">Who -- what happened was this.</sentence><sentence id="786">The Germans asked the chief rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, Elia Barzelai to give them a list of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="787">The rabbi of course had -- was given sa -- some time to prepare the list and during that time the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, or important Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> found out or they knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="788">And one of them was a -- a Greek Jewish journalist, Baruch Schibi, who was one of the leaders of resistance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">He was a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> who never intended to be in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Germans were, and when the Germans were entering <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, he attempted to leave and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, and he reached only Crete and then you know when the Germans attacked Crete with the parachutists, h -- and he was not able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and he returned back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="790">He knew what happened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="791">What happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> was that the leadership with Rabbi Koretz proved to be very ineffective.</sentence><sentence id="794">3 And since the Jews did not know that the Germans were killing Jews outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, they did not have the incentive that a hunted animal has.</sentence><sentence id="795">And you know, when somebody is hunted, the instinct of survival of course, is you -- to either flee, hide or fight.</sentence><sentence id="796">The -- the situation was such that although the German intentions towards the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> proved to be bad from the beginning, only the wealthy Jews, some 3,400 of them took advantage of the fact that up til February 1942, they were able to freely and legally move from the Bulgarian and German zones of occupation and go to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span>, where the Italians were living very well as I told you before.</sentence><sentence id="797">The remaining Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span>, and that's where the great majority of the Jews were, they did not know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="798">I feel they were like children who needed help, and nobody was ready to help them.</sentence><sentence id="799">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> the organization ELAS proposed to the community to help, but the leaders of the community refused this help.</sentence><sentence id="800">The communist party proposed to help, and they suggested that the Jewish children should go to trusted families of the party, and the rest of the population to be dispersed outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> as long as it was free and legal to do -- to do so.</sentence><sentence id="801">But this proposal was rejected by the leaders also.</sentence><sentence id="802">So basically, you have some over 50,000 Jews there not having any leaders, not knowing what was going on, and furthermore, not having Christian friends, most of them, as a result of anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="803">The population in <span class="COUNTRY">Macedonia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> was either indifferent or hostile to the Jews, and the proof is that out of over 10,000 Jewish families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span>, only one family, that of Haim Pardo, of five people was offered a shelter in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Dr. George and Fedra Carracortso right in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> where they stayed indoors for 18 months.</sentence><sentence id="804">There was some other 70 Jews who were saved in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span>, but these were mainly husbands, or fiances of Christians.</sentence><sentence id="805">The -- the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, or the other organizations of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> did not protest, did not do anything, but some lawyers protested to the general governor -- the general governor Simonides, he said, we are</sentence><sentence id="807">4 removing the thorns from your <span class="DLF">garden</span>, and you are protesting?</sentence><sentence id="808">The -- the one who pleaded with the Germans was the bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span>, Yanadios, who asked them to use magnanimity and clemency, especially when the time for the deportations came, and he -- he is considered as a righteous Gentile.</sentence><sentence id="809">Another protest for which <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> should be really proud was made by the archbishop of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, Damaskinos, and it was signed by 42 members -- leaders of Greek organizations.</sentence><sentence id="810">And in this case, what really happened was that the -- these people would meet periodically to discuss the problems of the occupation, and one day a Jewish woman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> told him what was happening, and the poet [indecipherable] Yanosh wrote the appeal, it was signed immediately by all 42, and it was delivered to the Germans, and to the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="811">The prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Logothetopoulos</span>, instead of trying to protect the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonica</span> when they were deported, he confessed that he was in favor of the deportations because there would be a lot of vacant housing that was needed.</sentence><sentence id="812">So, 252 Jewish students from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Salonica</span> became partisans of ELAS, over 600 Jews became partisans of ELAS.When the proposals of the communist party were rejected, the communists th -- remember that they had 150 members in their lists who were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="813">So they appealed to them to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="814">Out of them, 75 decided to go, but as they were divided into three groups and they were going for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, they thought, and what about our families?</sentence><sentence id="815">How are we going to let our families be by themselves in exile?</sentence><sentence id="816">And they came back and they surrendered to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="817">Now, Baruch Schibi knew all that, and he was afraid that the same thing was going to be repeated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="818">So he conceived the plan of abducting or killing Rabbi Barzelai of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="819">The other leaders of the resistance agreed with his plan, and they went to the rabbi and they told him.</sentence><sentence id="820">Rabbi was ready, he said I'm -- do anything you want with me.</sentence><sentence id="821">And they took him and his family and they moved them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="822">When the word went around, the Jews of</sentence><sentence id="824">5 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="825">However, there were poor Jews who at the beginning they thought they would hide too, but they needed to work.</sentence><sentence id="826">And they started going into the -- into the -- th -- to the Germans, and the Germans kindly extended their deadline and allowed all of the Jews who would come slowly [indecipherable] they would come and the -- the Germans wouldn't do anything to them more, they would come -- this was noticed by none other than an American consul general who was operating from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="827">And in the state department where there are 500 pages of documents sent from Consul Berry, Brigadier General Tindall, and Ambassador Makvay of [indecipherable] 500 pages.</sentence><sentence id="828">In one of them this situation is noticed by a b -- a -- Burton Berry, who s -- who tells the state department that -- that we need a little financial assistance here because the poor Jews are reporting and now they tell them that they should report within a 15 minute interval, which means that the Germans want to arrest them within that 15 minute interval.</sentence><sentence id="829">All these reports were ignored, and filed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">archives</span>, where I found them in 1975.</sentence><sentence id="830">Eventually 1,000 Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> were registered.</sentence><sentence id="831">But things became nice again.</sentence><sentence id="832">Everything was normal up til March of -- 25" of March 1944.</sentence><sentence id="833">That was the time that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> [indecipherable] that my mother was supposed to -- t-to find in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> if she went there, were all arrested.</sentence><sentence id="834">And the -- a-and -- and Burton Berry in another document says, didn't I tell you that this was going to happen?</sentence><sentence id="835">And -- and he gave other warnings.</sentence><sentence id="836">Actually, the most important warning that he gave was the following.</sentence><sentence id="837">There was a -- a -- a Greek Christian merchant, Michael [indecipherable] who, a-as I said before, business was as normal as it could be in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">He went on business, he was a tobacco merchant, and he was going on business to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="839">In his <span class="INT_SPACE">train compartment</span> -- evidently he was traveling first class, he started a conversation with three German SS officers, who told him point blank that we are going to stop here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span> because we are on our way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span>, where we will deport all the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span>.</sentence><sentence id="842">6 In other words, the Germans were so sure that nobody cared, especially a Christian merchant, that they told him a military secret.</sentence><sentence id="843">Now, this man was a good man.</sentence><sentence id="844">As soon as he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span>, he went straight to the American consul -- <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, and he told Burton Berry what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="845">Burton Berry immediately notified the state department, and again nothing happened, although it was so easy to make a radio contact with the British military missions.</sentence><sentence id="846">British military missions had contact with the resistance, which existed in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, not to mention secret American and British agents which operated in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="847">All of these people could have notified the Jews and tell them what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="848">It took -- fr -- from these reports, it took until June ninth, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span> were arrested.</sentence><sentence id="849">In the German archives, even the German commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corfu</span> send a report to his superiors, a lengthy report in which he was trying to tell them that there is no need to do anything towards the Jews, they have never bothered us.</sentence><sentence id="850">Evidently he -- he said, we don't have any means of transportation, why don't you arrest the -- the Italian soldiers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertolio</span> who are -- are dangerous?</sentence><sentence id="851">Th-The Jews never bothered us.</sentence><sentence id="852">Out of 2,000 Jews, only 187 returned from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="853">So this is the -- the -- the story with the -- the state depart -- and the American -- American government.</sentence><sentence id="854">Now, Baruch Schibi continued his activities as a -- a leader of the resistance, and he was responsible for the mili-military intelligence during certain battles in the [indecipherable] where

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1126">A: We -- we saw nothing, I mean, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was the same way like it was before, and only when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> and saw the -- there was none of the people that we were -- w-we used to -- to have there, that were na -- there, only then I started wondering why all this happened.</sentence><sentence id="1127">I had many questions that I had in my -- my mind.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Question number one would be why such a thing would happen.</sentence><sentence id="1129">And the -- my -- my answer was in one word, anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="1130">In two words would be religious anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And I'm very much -- very familiar with the -- the church teachings.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I know exactly what they say, especially during the -- the holy week.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And if -- if you have in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, young children who are exposed to the beautiful picture of Jesus Christ and then you love this person, and then all of a sudden you find out that it was the Jews who -- who killed him, I mean, how would you feel?</sentence><sentence id="1134">It's [indecipherable] like I faced that when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and on Good Friday we were in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and the -- and the priest did whatever he had to do.</sentence><sentence id="1135">When he came for a coffee to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1136">he apologized.</sentence><sentence id="1137">And he said, I -- I'm sorry I had to say so many things -- because that's in Greek, we can understand, that's not in Latin.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And, I'm sorry I had to say all these things, but you understand, that's my job.</sentence><sentence id="1139">My parents, of course, they</sentence><sentence id="1141">4 understood.</sentence><sentence id="1142">And the following day I saw a little boy, maybe no more than five, who I used to be his hero, and he used to follow me around all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And he looked at me with suspicion and some sort of hate.</sentence><sentence id="1144">So I told him, why, what -- what's wrong?</sentence><sentence id="1145">And he said, "You killed Jesus Christ."</sentence><sentence id="1146">And I will never forget that.</sentence><sentence id="1147">That would be my question number one.</sentence><sentence id="1148">The -- the second question would be when did the allies know about all this?</sentence><sentence id="1149">I was under the impression that they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1150">That's the reason my mother and I were eating that vegetable pie.</sentence><sentence id="1151">We -- we -- we walked for 14 hours.</sentence><sentence id="1152">What I found out is that the British had broken the older police code of the Germans as early as 1939.</sentence><sentence id="1153">And this older police was the one that was in charge of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1154">There are documents which prove that they knew exactly when a German unit would say, arrest 100 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, who was the leader of the group, how many men he had under his command, where did he stop on his way to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, or there were <span class="DLF">killing grounds</span> even in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And they -- they documented all that by simply following these radio transmissions.</sentence><sentence id="1156">So all this -- all this was known.</sentence><sentence id="1157">The -- the Americans, up til the time that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> declared war against the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, they had <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> and consulates all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1158">They had secret agents every -- everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="1159">The documents -- I -- I checked only the 500 documents that were related to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, they knew exactly everything to the point that rather than interviewing survivors when I wanted to -- to find what was going on, I preferred to read the -- the reports of Burton Berry.</sentence><sentence id="1160">He was a far more eloquent writer than any of these survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1161">So they knew what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1162">And then the third question is, why didn't they do anything?</sentence><sentence id="1163">And again, the answer comes in these words, religious anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="1164">Even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, there was discrimination against the Jews in terms of employment, and the -- the real historians know now that the state department not only blocked immigration, blocked information, they even tried to cover it up to the point that the -- that the -- that the secretary of the treasury sent a report saying</sentence><sentence id="1166">5 acqui -- acquiescence of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to the murder of the Jews of [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1167">That's serious stuff, ac-acquiescence.</sentence><sentence id="1168">And then you have other people who, like Professor David Wyman, who says that I, as a Christian, he says he -- he's appalled that the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> did not do anything and they remained silent in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1169">Let alone the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span>, let alone all the -- the bishops of all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1170">So this is the -- the old story.</sentence><sentence id="1171">But I have to say another thing, that like I mentioned before, the Jewish contribution, the Greek je -- military Jewish contribution with Colonel Frizis.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And this was very important and <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> has to be very proud of that because the action of the Greek army delayed the German attack against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by six crucial weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1173">The Germans were forced to fight a winter war in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, which was -- had disastrous consequences for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1174">So this I would say is the direct contribution of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, indirect contribution of -- of Colonel Frizis since he was the first one who stopped the Italians and then advanced as -- ahead of his troops, although he was killed later, but this was a great contribution.</sentence><sentence id="1175">Then you have all the Jews who fought in the British forces, including I would say the son of the first president of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, Haim Weitzman, who was shot down over the <span class="DLF">British channel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And then there were 550,000 American Jews who served in the armed forces of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1177">In other words, when we asked, why didn't the allies help?</sentence><sentence id="1178">I say, this is not a case of benevolence, or a case of -- of charity, the Jews earned and deserved the right to be assisted.</sentence><sentence id="1179">Not only that, let's not forget that if <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> became a nuclear power, which guaranteed American supremacy, it was because of Jewish men like Einstein, Oppenheimer, Ziller, Teller, Rabbe, while the relatives of these Jewish men were dying in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1180">Personally, I believe that it was wrong, unfair, ungrateful and shameful for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> to abandon the Jews and let them die the way they did.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1411">A: This is correct, but we had connections.</sentence><sentence id="1412">In other words, we had the right wing friend who -- who told us where to

were allowed to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1417">And -- and another thing is this, we left before the order for registration came.</sentence><sentence id="1418">We did not know there was going

around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> who -- who are glad that these things happen to you, and they are eag -- they are eagerly waiting to see what kind of

anything but deportation, and -- and having leaders who could not really lead them, and not having any good advice by their friends, they were waiting.</sentence><sentence id="1427">Now, once you are registered, the story changes.</sentence><sentence id="1428">Then what you do is dangerous if you try to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1429">Of course, the friend of -- of <span

they took the star and they threw it to -- to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1430">But it took much more bravery on their part to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1431">That's why the most important thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> is that the -- the deportations started very late, in March of 1943.The Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were already dead.</sentence><sentence id="1432">The Warsaw ghetto uprising was taking place at the exact same moment, around March, April, 1943.</sentence><sentence id="1433">Up til that time, the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> had plenty of time to disappear and dissolve, you know, in -- into eight million Greeks in a remote -- in [indecipherable] <span

class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> was great for the Jews to -- to -- to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1437">In addition to that the -- the Jews would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>, because the partisan organization, the naval branch of the partisan organization called ELAN had formed a -- in -- in agreement with the Jewish defense force Haganah, they transferred some 1500 Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and from there to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Even the prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, George Papandreo used this method of escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1439">So there was this in addition.</sentence><sentence id="1440">I believe since there were so many traitors, including six Jewish traitors, and I -- I</sentence><sentence id="1442">2 would like to -- to mention something about them, too.</sentence><sentence id="1443">I mean, we were not innocent, we had six Jewish traitors, all in collaboration with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1444">So the -- since there were so many traitors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so I would say the approximately 6,000 Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> who were saved, were saved either by going to the free partisan controlled areas, and -- or they stayed with -- in that work of resistance sympathizers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> who volunteered their services, and there are no cases where the [indecipherable] for example, they w -- they were appointed to go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for one man, but the -- the -- well, i -- this

to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1445">But in the case of the [indecipherable], what they did was they acted as if they were

id="1446">So they were taken to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span>, and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, but the Italian soldiers knew the address where the resistance told them to go.</sentence><sentence id="1447">They di -- because these people did not know anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1448">How could you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> unless you know somebody?</sentence><sentence id="1449">So the resistance provided a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them.</sentence><sentence id="1450">So the Italian soldiers went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they said, do you know something?We went to our commander, and we told him that we brung -- brought the prisoners here, but he said where are the prisoners and we couldn't produce you, so how about if you give us some money?</sentence><sentence id="1451">So the SS were afraid of blackmail on the part of the Italian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1452">They gave them some money and then they notified the resistance they were to leave this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1453">And sure enough the resistance says all right, you go to that <span
