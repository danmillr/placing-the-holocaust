<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: ... and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: I am Robert Treuer, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, January 31st, 1926.</sentence><sentence id="4">My family, my parents and I, I was the only child were considered Jewish even though we did not practice the religion, and know I had my grandparents and I am told, my great-grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="5">However, in the European system, such as it was, we were considered Jews, and when I started first grade, and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> began with the saying of the Lord's prayer, the teacher rapped an interruption and pointed to me and said you can't say that, you have to be quiet while the rest of the children say the Lord's prayer, and we'll start over again, and they did.</sentence><sentence id="6">I vividly remember March of 1938, when the Nazi's came in.</sentence><sentence id="7">I remember the tension during the days beforehand.</sentence><sentence id="8">I was awakened about two in the morning by SA troops marching in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, singing the song, marching throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">It was not the first time that violence had come to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, but I'll talk about that later.</sentence><sentence id="10">That night, there were very few Jews in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">nineteenth district Vienna</span>, Dehrbling(ph) and the part we lived in was Severing(ph), it was near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city outskirts</span> on the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vienna woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">That night there was a bloody beating of another Jew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, man by the name of Roldt(ph), or Roth, as I recall it.</sentence><sentence id="12">He had been accused of being a pedophile.</sentence><sentence id="13">Whether this was true or not, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="14">My parents were not bothered, not was I that night.</sentence><sentence id="15">My father operated a very small <span class="BUILDING">stationery store</span>, about a block from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived where we lived, at six , It was a two room <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">My mother gave piano lessons, either at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or going to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of others.</sentence><sentence id="17">My father and I did not know this at the time, or as a child, had been in the anti-fascist underground during the years prior to the Nazi takeover in 1938, smuggling escapees across the</sentence><sentence id="19"><span class="DLF">border</span> near <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, bringing in underground newspapers from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and he and an associate distributed these newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="20">What happened was that he had been very active in the social democratic party, particularly in youth and children's activities and cultural activities until the fascist takeover in 1934 and the fighting that then erupted.</sentence><sentence id="21">My father was involved, he had tried to distribute guns from the <span class="DLF">back stoop</span> of his <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">I saw the fighting, I saw the _, the national guard is comparable, and the private armies come through the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, heard the shooting, a sniper shot at my father in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, the bullet imbedded above my head in my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> as I was asleep.</sentence><sentence id="23">The fighting didn't last long, artillery was used to shoot at the worker's apartment houses, notably the Karl Marx __, the kilometer long first public housing for low income people in the city of Vienna, and in other <span class="BUILDING">apartment complexes</span> there had been an effort during the socialist administration to provide low income housing.</sentence><sentence id="24">The fighting was bitter.</sentence><sentence id="25">Armored <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriers</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> pulled up in our <span class="DLF">street</span> and went on door to <span class="DLF">door</span> searches of <span class="INT_SPACE">people's apartments</span> looking for contraband, guns or political material, what have you, and these ___ were repeated.</sentence><sentence id="26">When <span class="BUILDING">school</span> resumed after a few days of the fighting, I passed by artillery emplacements on the street comers and armed troops at <span class="DLF">intersections</span> who waved us children across.</sentence><sentence id="27">I didn't understand the political ins and outs of it, but I understood exactly what happened because the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> where I'd gone after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, all activities that had been part and parcel of my personal life then as an eight year old were shot down immediately and completely.</sentence><sentence id="28">And stories came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about, for example two men waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> at a <span class="BUILDING">street car stop</span>, telling a joke, not realizing that the man standing behind them was a plainclothes police who promptly arrested them for telling a political joke, and even as an eight year old, I knew what that meant, that you had to be very careful.</sentence><sentence id="29">Of course my parents were careful in that they did not tell me very much information that by blabbing I could possibly hurt them without meaning to.</sentence><sentence id="30">For example I did not know until many years later</sentence><sentence id="32">that my father took long summer vacations, during which he established a new identity as an itinerant farm laborer on <span class="DLF">farms</span> along the Austrian-<span class="DLF">Czechoslovak border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">The growth of the Austrian Nazi party was palpable, although again as a child I did not, that did not register with me particularly.</sentence><sentence id="34">When the Nazis, or when Anschluss came, in March of 1938, and the German army marched in unopposed, either by <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or any other international community, and apparently with the tacit backing of Mussolini in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, the reception that I saw of the German troops, you know the Nazis, by the Austrian population was overwhelming.</sentence><sentence id="35">And for example, many of the active socialists, even those in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, switched parties and joined the Nazi party.</sentence><sentence id="36">Some of them warned my father that because they knew, now the Nazis would know about his underground activities and that he and his associate, Ernst Pollit(ph) would be very wise to cut it out immediately.</sentence><sentence id="37">My father, Fritz Treuer, was under no illusions what the advent of the Nazis meant, he knew about the Nuremberg laws, about the persecution of the Jews, about confiscation of property, and he immediately started making efforts to get us out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">Some of the rest of our relatives were not as alarmed as he was, my mother's two sisters and their husbands, professional people, thought that well, they were engineers, they had particular skills that were in demand and they didn't, while things might be unpleasant, there was no great danger.</sentence><sentence id="39">My father tried to tell them otherwise and was not believed.</sentence><sentence id="40">He also tried to get three or four Jewish boys together and give us the beginnings of rudimentary military training in somebody's <span class="DLF">garden</span> behind a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a high <span class="DLF">hedge</span> or a <span class="DLF">wall</span> around it, it lasted exactly two times, two afternoons after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">Somebody saw us, it was reported and one the erstwhile socialists got ahold of Dad and said this had better stop right now or you're going to get nailed.</sentence><sentence id="42">That was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="43">My accordion teacher, who came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span>, was stopped in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">He was a very large man, his name was Hamlish, and very curly black hair, he was immediately taken for a Jew by passing by Nazis, who began</sentence><sentence id="46">pulling his hair, beating him up and so on, although I think he would have been big enough to take care of any two or three of them.</sentence><sentence id="47">It was impossible, they were armed.</sentence><sentence id="48">That was the last accordion lesson.</sentence><sentence id="49">Hamlish incidentally, and his wife managed to escape, I'm not sure exactly how they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, they subsequently had children born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, one of whom is Marvin Hamlish, a musical arranger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: I wanted to ask, before the Anschluss, and you mentioned specifically that when you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you were sitting in, you were in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> singing and they stopped, the teacher asked you to stop, was that the only incident that was before March 1938?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: No, the only incident of anti-Semitism that I experienced?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: No, there were many, that was just a representative?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: That was a representative, there were many, and on the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was the usual bullying.</sentence><sentence id="108">My parents took the attitude that whether it was racial or not, I had to fight my own fights, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="109">The anti-Semitism was generic and general and you picked up on it in many subtle ways.</sentence><sentence id="110">It was not usually violent, except as when kids fought on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, although I do remember one incident which may give you the flavor of it, is before the Anschluss, some of us kids were playing in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I was, chasing each other, reckless, I didn't look, plunging across the <span class="DLF">street</span> head first and ran into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicyclist</span> hard enough, I bent the front wheel of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> badly enough so he couldn't ride it.</sentence><sentence id="111">I got some good cuts and bruises out of that one, but he immediately found out who I was, knew who my father was and he was a local Nazi, remember this was before the Anschluss, and he marched me and his damaged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Dad's store</span> and swung enough weight by virtue of his party membership so that before Dad could even attend to me and take me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span>, which was done later, he had to pay the man off for the damage to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, cash then and there or else, and the or else could and probably would have been beatings, damage to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="112">After</sentence><sentence id="114">the Anschluss, and very quickly saw, there was such an explosion of uniforms, Hitler youth and so on, amazingly fast.</sentence><sentence id="115">There were round-ups of Jews in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, made to scrub the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">This happened to a distant relative of ours, and elderly woman, not in good health and when some of the people standing around made remarks about that to the storm troopers who were conducting the street scrubbing, one of them walked over to the woman and said, well I think maybe you can get up and leave, it seems you're not Jewish, and she said, yes I am, I'm 400% Jewish, all four of my grandparents are Jews.</sentence><sentence id="117">A similar thing happened to my mother who was rounded up between piano lessons, on the streets of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and she was blonde, blue-eyed, petite.</sentence><sentence id="118">If you wanted a poster girl for your Aryan woman, she would have been it, and again when she was down there scrubbing <span class="DLF">streets</span>, people started to mutter that these stupid SS men, SA men didn't know what they were doing, look at this, and one of them told mom to get up and get out of there and she said, no I'm Jewish, I belong here the same as the rest of these people, I'll go when they go.</sentence><sentence id="119">And I think that was a very short-lived, street scrubbing.</sentence><sentence id="120">It wasn't always that kind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: So immediately after Anschluss, you immediately felt an impact on your personal lives?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: It was immediate and it was massive.</sentence><sentence id="139">In the popular support, and you heard nothing against it, no one spoke against it, and my parents got busy, my father particularly.</sentence><sentence id="140">Remember him telling my mother that it was only a matter of days before the Nuremberg laws were applied, as indeed they were, and that they had to do everything possible to get out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">Now I later came across, in my parents personal papers, and then they're both dead now, correspondence to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span>, Chili, anywhere possible to get out.</sentence><sentence id="142">What eventually happened was that my mother found employment as a housemaid in a <span class="BUILDING">rural English household</span>, I think through an <span class="BUILDING">employment agency</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">Through a <span class="BUILDING">refugee agency</span>, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> was found for me in an <span class="BUILDING">English boarding school</span>, an Orthodox Jewish boarding school which would take me in, because the law at that time was if you were an</sentence><sentence id="145">adult you could enter <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> only if you had proof of employment, if you were a child, you had to have proof that somebody would take you in, well my mother's employers would not allow a child, however the place in the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> sufficed for me.</sentence><sentence id="146">We were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, the , the west railway in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> by my father and a few family friends, I had no brothers or sisters and took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, exiting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at__--_ through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and then to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">channel boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, except that at__--_, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped, all Jews were taken off, rounded up and surrounded by heavily armed police, SS and others, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out and left.</sentence><sentence id="147">The reason for that, I don't know, it could have been that one person on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had tried to smuggle contraband out, at least that's what was said.</sentence><sentence id="148">We were standing in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cluster</span> approximately, I would guess about 40 or 50 refugees with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span>, such as it was, and tightly hemmed in by armed guards.</sentence><sentence id="149">My mother, Mia Treuer and I, were in the middle of this cluster and she took a quick look around, clamped my hand in hers and we each had a suitcase in the other hands and whispered to me, she said, don't look, don't say anything, come.</sentence><sentence id="150">And she marched through the middle of this packed little crowd, between two guards looking neither left nor right and they looked a little surprised and she kept right on going, I with her, into the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, <span class="BUILDING">station restaurant</span>, where I had the first cup of coffee in my life, and we sat very quietly, she and I at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">restaurant table</span>, nursing a coffee.</sentence><sentence id="151">I don't know what happened to the rest of the refugees taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">We sat in that <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> for hours until the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came, at which time I was ready to leap up and run for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and with one look at my mom and I sat right where I was.</sentence><sentence id="153">People got off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, other people got on and she didn't make a move.</sentence><sentence id="154">I was just bursting with impatience because I knew I was waiting there.</sentence><sentence id="155">And at the last moment she said, very abrupt, come.</sentence><sentence id="156">We grabbed our suitcases, out the <span class="DLF">door</span>, up the steps of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and it started to move, it was moving as we found <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and seconds later, we were out.</sentence><sentence id="157">I owe her my life.</sentence><sentence id="158">Not only in the sense</sentence><sentence id="160">that she gave me birth.</sentence><sentence id="161">The trip through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was uneventful and the channel crossing eventful only by my getting sick to my stomach.</sentence><sentence id="162">Took the _ <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where my father's brother was waiting for us.</sentence><sentence id="163">I don't know how he got out, I suspect he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> illegally, but I don't know the circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="164">He met us at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, took us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">As we rounded the corner to enter the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, roof to <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, Nazi banners are flying there and I panicked, I was terrified, I didn't know what had happened, were we back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or what?</sentence><sentence id="166">But it turned out some sporting event and the Nazi team was being hosted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">The next morning my mother took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for her employment out in the <span class="REGION">country side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">My uncle took me to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I was to attend.</sentence><sentence id="169">Turned out to be an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">The headmaster, my recollection is a black coat, white shirt, black tie, a black hat, full beard.</sentence><sentence id="171">Looked me over as I was brought into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and said this boy is not a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="172">My hairwas___.</sentence><sentence id="173">My uncle assured him that I was.</sentence><sentence id="174">I was quizzed on my knowledge of Hebrew which was nonexistent, although in a cram course, an effort was made to teach me something before I left.</sentence><sentence id="175">It hadn't taken.</sentence><sentence id="176">And although my knowledge of English was very limited, I only had a few words at that time, I understood very clearly that he wouldn't take me.</sentence><sentence id="177">Because this was a strict <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> and he could not violate the integrity of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">My uncle pleaded with him, first time I ever heard my uncle plead with anyone.</sentence><sentence id="179">He was a mountain climber, kayaker, skier, and boyhood idol of mine.</sentence><sentence id="180">But he pleaded, he said there was a real risk and a danger that if I were not where I was supposed to be I would be deported and no questions asked, it would be immediate, and his pleading must have had some effect because the headmaster of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did consider it and he asked one more question, I didn't understand the English, it had to be translated for me, and the question was, was I circumcised and the answer was no, and he said, no we can't take him.</sentence><sentence id="181">Not even for one day, not for two days.</sentence><sentence id="182">We left.</sentence><sentence id="183">Just how my uncle found another <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>, I don't know if this one was religious</sentence><sentence id="185">secular.</sentence><sentence id="186">I don't know, but before the end of the day he had found another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that would take me in free, there was no money.</sentence><sentence id="187">What little our family had had been sequestered and we had no money.</sentence><sentence id="188">This <span class="BUILDING">school</span> turned out to be a <span class="DLF">snake pit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">My first night there, sleeping in the large <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> with many other boys my age, one started screaming in great pain, and I tried to find out from the boy in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> next to mine what was going on and I didn't understand the English, and he pointed at his appendix and I knew what that was, the boy had appendicitis and he screamed for a long time before finally some of the staff showed up and the gist of what they had told him was to turn over and pray.</sentence><sentence id="190">Well I understood that clearly enough, I found myself in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where if you had appendicitis, you prayed.</sentence><sentence id="191">The next day the other kids went to various <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>, I had no English, they told me to hang around in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I did.</sentence><sentence id="192">I was raped before the day was out, by a staff member.</sentence><sentence id="193">I told no one.</sentence><sentence id="194">I felt responsible for what had happened, it was my fault.</sentence><sentence id="195">Ididn't___find out until long afterwards that this is a common reaction of victims, of child victims of sexual abuse that the child takes on the bad feelings about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="196">It's a simple phenomenon, I know it now.</sentence><sentence id="197">During the magic years of childhood, the adult can do no wrong and if something happens between a child and an adult that is wrong, it cannot be the fault of the adult.</sentence><sentence id="198">And I was a very small, pint-sized 12.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: So your mother was living separately from you obviously, she was working away from?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Yes, she lived with the people that she worked for out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">I'm not clear just exactly where in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, she worked for a Major Woodiwiss, who was a widower with I believe some children and she was expected to keep the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> clean and take care of the children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: So you really had no one close to you that you could talk to about this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: My uncle did come to visit me.</sentence><sentence id="275">He had made it plain to me that I could not stay wherever he was staying and I had the impression that he shifted <span class="NPIP">places</span> to stay every couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="276">This is what</sentence><sentence id="278">makes me think that he was there illegally.</sentence><sentence id="279">There was a small handful of Austrian socialists there who tried to help each other and apparently he would sleep with one family one night or two and then move on and I didn't tell him what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="280">He could tell quickly enough that something was out of whack but he didn't know what, nor could he do much about it except that he did get me out of there.</sentence><sentence id="281">He made connections with another Vienna socialist who was the director of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> for Spanish orphans, these were the orphans of ____, the surviving children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basque</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, and the British while they would not help the Spanish Republicans, did put up a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">temporary tent camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kensington Park</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> of Peter Pan, I'm told, and the Viennese socialists whom my uncle knew and who it turned out also knew my father, they made a deal and my uncle came and got me from that <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> and took me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> where the director of the camp met me at the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">He said are you Bobby Treuer?</sentence><sentence id="284">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="285">I was carrying my tiny, little red cardboard suitcase, which I still have, I said yes, he said, you are Fritz Treuer's son?</sentence><sentence id="286">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="287">He said I know a Fritz Treuer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">He said run, and I ran.</sentence><sentence id="289">I ran through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> and dark haired, dark skinned kids saw another dark hair, dark skin kid coming and they enveloped me and I disappeared into one of the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">They didn't speak German, I didn't speak Spanish, none of us had much English, we all spoke survival.</sentence><sentence id="291">We supported and loved one another.</sentence><sentence id="292">One day there was news of a Republican victory in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, I don't know how it got it, and there was an impromptu torchlight parade and we ran around the perimeter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> was so happy, somebody was fighting for us, and they won.</sentence><sentence id="293">We ran around there until we dropped.</sentence><sentence id="294">It was only four or five days later and the black bordered envelopes came, the typical European death notices were bordered in black,
