<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Well, they were I suppose I should say difficult weeks for a person who had never known anything about the military.</sentence><sentence id="67">My father hadn't even allowed me to be a Boy Scout because he was afraid I might like, I might like military things and uh get to like to wearing a uniform and marching.</sentence><sentence id="68">Uh my father you can see was uh a pacifist and indeed uh he was more than that.</sentence><sentence id="69">He was a member of the , and that was the first <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> that I went to at the age of four, the Schula (ph).</sentence><sentence id="70">Uh but uh those first days and weeks at uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Bragg</span> were days of learning.</sentence><sentence id="71">Uh learning a totally new world.</sentence><sentence id="72">And so, for example, the very first day that I arrived, I knew that I was supposed to report to the Commanding General.</sentence><sentence id="73">I went to his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">I hear a "come in".</sentence><sentence id="75">I walked in and not knowing that I should do anything differently, I walked up to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> where he was seated, and uh put out my hand to shake hands with him.</sentence><sentence id="76">And uh he looked at me with a smile on his face, and uh he was a very kind and compassionate man he said chaplain, we don't do things that way in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="77">Now what you will do is you go out, come back in again.</sentence><sentence id="78">As soon as you're <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="DLF">door</span>, you come to attention and salute, and say, Chaplain Nadich reporting for duty, sir.</sentence><sentence id="79">I uh was shame- faced, but I walked out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> again, came back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, did exactly as he had told me, and from that point on, he took me in hand.</sentence><sentence id="80">He uh got hold of a young officer and told him to spend the next day with me, to teach me about military courtesy, the courtesies of the service, and how to march in a military parade, for the very next day I was to march in a military parade behind the commanding general as a member of his staff.</sentence><sentence id="81">Well, I, fortunately I learned quickly and so uh it wasn't long before I was a regular member of the Army.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: What were the circumstances that uh sent you <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Ah.</sentence><sentence id="101">I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Bragg</span> for only seventy days, when I received orders to report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Hamilton</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, for overseas shipment to <span class="BUILDING">Army Post Office</span>, APO 887.</sentence><sentence id="102">I quickly ascertained that APO 887 was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">And I was rather pleased to go to that part of the world.</sentence><sentence id="104">I proceeded to Fort uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamilton</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and after waiting for ten days, I was shipped by uh bya uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch freighter</span> which was a part of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> of 55 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and after sailing 24 days on the high seas, uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">I learned afterwards, incidentally, that uh another chaplain who had far more experience than I, who had been in the Army Reserve in peace time, uh was first asked to go and he thought better of it.</sentence><sentence id="106">He declined and I was tapped as the next man, and I was glad to go.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: So you landed...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">I reported as I had been instructed to do at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltham</span> (ph) which was our service of <span class="BUILDING">supply headquarters</span>, and after a day or two in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltham</span> and going through the uh routine, the red tape, I was assigned to the northern, the northern Ireland Bay Section which was located just outside the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belfast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">The reason for my being sent there, since I was the first Jewish chaplain ordered to the European theater, was because our first American troops were stationed in <span class="REGION">Northern Ireland</span>, and an <span class="BUILDING">armored headquarters</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">corps headquarters</span>, and uh two infantry divisions, and I immediately began visiting every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> to search out Jewish soldiers and officers, and to arrange for services and for whatever, whatever other service I could render to the soldiers of Jewish faith.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: You had told me at lunch something about the particular way in which you solved a burial...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="128">As a matter of fact the immediate reason for the uh request by General Eisenhower for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain to be dispatched immediately to the <span class="REGION">European theater</span>, was because there was some kind of a problem that could have become a uh cause-celebre.</sentence><sentence id="129">Uh a Jewish soldier had had been killed in a uh motor, Army motor motor vehicle accident and since there was no American Army Jewish chaplain at the time, the uh rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belfast</span>, Rabbi , was asked whether he would officiate at the funeral service, the burial service for this Jewish soldier.</sentence><sentence id="130">And he was very quick to respond of course he would be pleased to oblige, but he said that he would insist that this Jewish soldier be buried in a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> as is provided for by Jewish law, and he even offered to provide a <span class="DLF">grave</span> in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> of his congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belfast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">The Army authorities told him that according to Army regulations, every American Army soldier overseas who would have to be buried in a foreign, in foreign soil, would have to be buried in an American Army, a <span class="DLF">military cemetery</span> because after the war would be over, the remains of these soldiers, at the request of their families, would be returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, would be returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">The Irish rabbi said that he, he could not officiate under those circumstances, and since the military were concerned for the feelings and the good opinion of the civilian population, uh the American military authorities saw the need immediately for a, an American Army Jewish chaplain.</sentence><sentence id="133">Hence the request for such a chaplain and therefore I was dispatched.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: .</sentence><sentence id="142">How long were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Uh I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> for approximately, well say August to November, and uh I I was uh ordered from <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> uh when uh I appeared at the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> one uh fine morning to visit the troops, and to my amazement the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were empty.</sentence><sentence id="146">I did not know where the troops had gone, but later I learned they had been shipped of course secretly for the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">Soon after that I was ordered to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and since I was still the only free, that is non-assigned to a division, Jewish chaplain, I was ordered to the <span class="DLF">American Military Cemetery</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookwood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surry</span>, not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and I was uh stationed with the American detachment uh who took care of burials at their uh <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilking</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="148">We actually occupied a a small <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilking</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">At the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> I would officiate at all <span class="BUILDING">Jewish funerals</span> on Mondays and Thursdays.</sentence><sentence id="150">The other days of the week, I would get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicle</span> and a driver from <span class="BUILDING">southern base headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salisbury</span>, and cover one slice of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">I had</sentence><sentence id="153">carved up <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> into various slices so that I would be able to visit each <span class="REGION">area</span> once a month.</sentence><sentence id="154">In each <span class="BUILDING">Army headquarters</span> or <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I would find a Jewish officer or non-commissioned officer or private who would know how to conduct a Jewish service, give him prayer books and other religious supplies, have him conduct the services each week, but I would show up once a month to uh be of help, to conduct a monthly service, and to help with any problems that might arise.</sentence><sentence id="155">As more Jewish chaplains arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span>, I would assign them to take parts of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or, and <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span>, and thus my own <span class="REGION">territory</span> would be decreased as time went on.</sentence><sentence id="156">But I went as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> and again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belfast</span>, and in all parts of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and to some parts of <span class="REGION">Wales</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: How long did this go on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: Uh this uh continued for about a year while I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surry</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and then for the second year I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> proper uh at <span class="BUILDING">American Army Headquarters</span> uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> uh at uh at or near Grosvenor (ph) Square.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: And what did you do from a</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: And there I was uh a chaplain in the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the theater chaplain, who was a Roman Catholic monsignor, .</sentence><sentence id="177">His deputy was an Episcopalian chaplain, Edwin Carter, Jr., uh known familiarly as Nick Carter, and I was the uh the one Jewish chaplain at <span class="BUILDING">theater headquarters</span>, and I was given the assignment of uh G3 (c) that is I was in charge of all religious supplies there and later on in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: What did it mean to be in charge of religious supplies?</sentence><sentence id="179">What are some of the things you had to do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Uh well uh I recall particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where my job was more difficult, uh that I had to uh obtain for Catholic chaplains, mass kits for example, and uh hymnals, and hymnals as well for Protestant chaplains.</sentence><sentence id="183">Uh I had to uh visit uh vineyards (ph) who had been approved by the local French Catholic bishop, uh that is whose wine was approved for, for use in mass, and I would uh taste the various wines to make sure that I got a good tasting wine for my friends who were uh Catholic chaplains, and I would uh buy the uh the wines for Catholic mass, and I supplied uh Protestant and Catholic chaplains and Jewish chaplains with all of their needs.</sentence><sentence id="184">Even going so far as to supply New Testaments in German for German prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="185">That I got a special kick out of, that a rabbi should be supplying German prisoners of war with New Testaments in German.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Can you describe it?</sentence><sentence id="233">Describe your first meeting with a, with the group of survivors?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Uh, my first meeting with the survivors happened in a rather interesting way.</sentence><sentence id="237">I uh took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and drove to the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I had been told Jews had been living, the <span class="REGION">area</span> known as the , the little <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">And I flew my Jewish chaplain's flag from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">Uh you may know that the uh Jewish chaplain's flag consisted of a dark blue background, and in the center there was the Jewish chaplain's insignia, consisting of the Ten Commandments, the two tablets of the Ten Commandments.</sentence><sentence id="240">Above the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tablets</span>, uh the uh six-pointed Star of David.</sentence><sentence id="241">It didn't take long before some people came out and recognized, of course, the Jewish symbols, and began to talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="242">And they noticed on the lapels of my Army uh uniform the same insignia.</sentence><sentence id="243">And they began to ask me who I was, what was I doing there.</sentence><sentence id="244">It didn't take long before a crowd had assembled.</sentence><sentence id="245">And some of them thought I should talk to a small committee of Jewish leaders that had already been created to be of help to the Jewish survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">Now where did these Jews come from who had survived the German occupation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>?</sentence><sentence id="247">Most of them had fled during the German occupation, or just prior to it, to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where the Italians were in charge.</sentence><sentence id="248">The south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was under Italian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="249">The Italians were never as rigid or severe in their governance of their <span class="REGION">territory</span> as were the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="250">And so it was easier for a Jew to hide himself in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, in the <span class="REGION">area</span> under Italian orders.</sentence><sentence id="251">And so when the war was over and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated, very quickly these Jews came back out of hiding from the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">There were a few who had indeed been hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="253">And who had miraculously survived.</sentence><sentence id="254">Now I was brought to this committee that was meeting uh in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that they had taken over as a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">And they uh spoke to me uh and told me of their problems and their needs.</sentence><sentence id="256">And among other things they quickly gave to me uh a batch of uh the yellow star that the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had to wear, on which of course was the French word , Jew.</sentence><sentence id="257">And uh I brought those yellow stars back to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">Uh but uh they told me that their immediate need was to open a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span>, uh that food was in short supply.</sentence><sentence id="259">They also would like to open they told me a free <span class="BUILDING">loan society</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">Uh I communicated with uh the uh Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, through military</sentence><sentence id="262">channels, and I was cabled from the JDC but through the Jewish Welfare Board which was the only organization set up to deal with American Army Jewish chaplains.</sentence><sentence id="263">Through the JWB I received $10,000 from the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="264">That $10,000 was used by this committee of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to open the first <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and to start the first Jewish free loan society that would enable uh small Jewish shop keepers and artisans to start up work again.</sentence><sentence id="265">Uh that uh didn't end my uh relationship with the Jews who had survived.</sentence><sentence id="266">I met with the committee very often, until the JDC opened its own <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> on the Rue de in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> uh but throughout my year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, every morning virtually, there were as many as thirty to thirty-five Jews, Parisian Jews or French Jews, who found themselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, who lined up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> outside of my <span class="BUILDING">Army office</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Majestique</span> which was <span class="BUILDING">American Army headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">Each one of whom had his own story that he wanted to tell me, to communi...communicate with relatives, particularly relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, to try to find relatives or problems

a group of a few hundred, he mentioned possibly as many as eight hundred, would be moved soon from a <span class="DLF">southern French port</span>.</sentence><sentence id="418">Could I possibly help with getting food supplies because even had they the money, it would have been very difficult to buy food in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at that particular time in history.</sentence><sentence

illegal ships to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">By the way, there were a number of American Army Jewish chaplains who helped the Brichah in similar

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="516">Q: How did this come to be?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="518">A: This was, that's uh a question of interest because uh there was no such position ever before uh in the American Army or indeed in any other army.</sentence><sentence id="519">An advisor to a commanding general with regard to Jewish problems.</sentence><sentence id="520">And there, it's interesting as to how it came to pass.</sentence><sentence id="521">The war, American war correspondents had reported during the summer of 1945, and their reports were read by Americans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, elsewhere, in the in the daily press, that Jewish survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> were being badly treated.</sentence><sentence id="522">And as a result President Truman appointed uh Dean Earl G.

Weiss (ph) of what we had seen in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and uh Dr. Weiss, uh at the suggestion of one of the chaplains, the late Rabbi Robert Marcus (ph), uh sent a dispatch through the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to General Eisenhower, suggesting the appointment of a Jewish chaplain as a liaison officer to coordinate the work being done to help the Jewish survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="529">Uh General Eisenhower two days later replied to Rabbi Weiss on the 9th of August that uh he did not agree with the suggestion, that uh there could be no appointment of a Jewish liaison officer because liaison officers were at his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> representing various nations.</sentence><sentence id="530">There was a French liaison officer.</sentence><sentence id="531">There was a Polish liaison officer.</sentence><sentence id="532">A Czech liaison officer.</sentence><sentence id="533">But there couldn't be a reli...a religious liaison officer.</sentence><sentence id="534">Well, uh Gen...General Eisenhower had already received from General Marshall, the</sentence><sentence id="536">1 Chief of Staff, several days before this a communication telling him that the report of Dean Earl G.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="567">Q: What did you find when you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="569">A: Well, uh I uh I found that the Army had planned uh fully as to what to do with any survivors who might be found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="570">There had been set up a combined displaced persons executive, which was a large <span class="BUILDING">office</span> staffed by a number of officers.</sentence><sentence id="571">There was a general who was in charge, General Nicholson.</sentence><sentence id="572">Uh this combined DP executive was under the general command of uh the G5 on General Eisenhower's staff, General Adcock (ph), and they were doing a good job in following the plans that had been prepared a long time before.</sentence><sentence id="573">Those plans said simply that the survivors found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> should be quickly sent back to the lands of their origin.</sentence><sentence id="574">And indeed French and, and Belgian and Greek and other nationals found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> within ninety days were sent back to their homelands.</sentence><sentence id="575">But what the planners had not thought of was number one there would be German Jews and Austrian Jews and Hungarian Jews who came from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that were considered enemy countries by the American Army, so they were enemy nationalists, and nobody had planned for enemy nationalists to be found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="576">The irony was that the Germans, the Hungarians, uh the Austrians had deprived these Jews of their German, Austrian, Hungarian citizenship, but now they were given that citizenship again because to do otherwise would be to follow the practice of of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="577">And so they were enemy nationalists.</sentence><sentence id="578">That was one problem.</sentence><sentence id="579">The second problem was, and this was a far greater problem, the planners, the military planners had never contemplated the possibility that there would be survivors who were, who would be Jews who would refuse to return to the lands of their origin.</sentence><sentence id="580">Polish Jews.</sentence><sentence id="581">Ukrainian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="582">Lithuanian, Estonian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="583">Uh Hungarian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="584">Romanian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="585">Because they knew that their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, their <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> that they once had had in their lands of origin had been seized by their erstwhile neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="586">They knew also that in many cases their former non-Jewish neighbors had cooperated with the Nazis in turning in their Jewish neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="587">Indeed in helping the Nazis ship their Jewish neighbors to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="588">They knew that it would be dangerous even to return to the lands of their origin.</sentence><sentence id="589">They were concerned less their neighbors now in possession of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> attack them, as indeed happened.</sentence><sentence id="590">Moreover, psychologically these Jews, survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span>, knew that the very <span class="REGION">land</span>, the very soil where they had once lived was now a soil that absorbed the blood of their children and their parents and their spouses.</sentence><sentence id="591">That the very <span class="DLF">air</span> was polluted with the smoke of the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> where Jews had been burned.</sentence><sentence id="592">They had no desire to return to the <span class="REGION">lands</span> from which they had come.</sentence><sentence id="593">Now it was the problems of these Jews in particular that had not been thought of in advance.</sentence><sentence id="594">Therefore the Army indeed did not take care properly of these Jewish survivors.</sentence><sentence id="595">It</sentence><sentence id="597">2 wasn't until the 22nd of August when General Eisenhower issued an order that the Army take care of these survivors and that so-called enemy nationals who

combined displaced persons executive.</sentence><sentence id="642">And I spent oh the better part of a week uh learning what my job was to, to consist of.</sentence><sentence id="643">I read through a lot of uh files and I had long discussions uh with uh the several officers who were a part of the combined DP executive and then I uh compiled for myself a list of questions that would be a questionnaire for me when I would arrive in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="644">The questions would have to do with uh <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>, food, sanitary conditions, medical conditions, health of people and uh the like and where did these people want to go.</sentence><sentence id="645">What did they see as the solution, the ultimate solution to their problems.</sentence><sentence id="646">So armed with this questionnaire, I started off on my first tour.</sentence><sentence id="647">And I went first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> uh then under the command of the 3"!</sentence><sentence id="648">Army, whose commanding general was General George Patton.</sentence><sentence id="649">And uh General Patton had appointed a Major Schaffer (ph) as his displaced persons officer on his staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, which was the headquarters of the 3rd Army.</sentence><sentence id="650">Well, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and I headed first for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617"

the report of Dean Harrison, Feldafing had been praised.</sentence><sentence id="653">Indeed uh Dean Harrison had stated that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span> should be the model for other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence

charge was headed by a Lieutenant Irving Smith.</sentence><sentence id="656">Now Irving Smith was a very able and efficient Army officer.</sentence><sentence id="657">He was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="658">He was sympathetic to the plight of the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="659">And yet the Jews of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> voiced to me through a committee whom they had chosen, their complaints about Lieutenant Smith.</sentence><sentence id="660">Why?</sentence><sentence id="661">Well, because he issued orders without consulting with the committee.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="662">He, well that that was his job.</sentence><sentence id="663">He was an Army officer.</sentence><sentence id="664">And he wasn't trained to be in charge of a group of civilians in dire need.</sentence><sentence id="665">But as I went around through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the committee, the Jewish committee, I was appalled by what I had seen.</sentence><sentence id="666">Why was I so upset?</sentence><sentence id="667">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span>, which had been held up by Dean Harrison as the model camp, was severely over-crowded.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="668">There were uh a number of, of uh <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that were completely unfit for human habitation.</sentence><sentence id="669">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were in many cases uh <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> with poor roofing so that whenever it rained everything <span class="NPIP">inside</span> would get wet.</sentence><sentence id="670">Certainly as I thought of the coming winter, people couldn't be housed in, under such conditions.</sentence><sentence id="671">In addition, there was severe crowding in all of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where the Jews were living.</sentence><sentence id="672">Remember, this was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="673">The Jews had been moved out</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="677">3 of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> soon after the liberation, and had been put into this kind of <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>, which had been constructed originally for foreign workers who had come into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, who came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from such <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> uh as <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">Many of them were brought by the Germans as slave labor to work in German industry while the Germans themselves were in the German Army.</sentence><sentence id="679">Some had volunteered to come because of their sympathy with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="680">Well, now these foreign workers were also displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="681">They claimed the status of displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="682">And their <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> that had been used for them was now being used by Jewish displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="683">And I thought the conditions in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span> were deplorable.</sentence><sentence id="684">And I wondered how bad could the conditions be elsewhere if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span> had been praised by Dean Harrison as a model <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="685">I found out why Harrison praised Feldafing, and that was because Feldafing at that time was almost unique in that it was an all-Jewish camp.</sentence><sentence id="686">Now other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where Jewish survivors were being housed were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where non-Jews were also being housed.</sentence><sentence id="687">Who were these non-Jews?</sentence><sentence id="688">They were the foreign workers I mentioned a moment ago.</sentence><sentence id="689">In many cases they were sympathetic to the Jews, but in most cases they were anti-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="690">Many of them were, had been sympathetic to the Nazi cause, had volunteered to come as workers to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="691">Moreover they had been fed well and housed well and clothed well, all through the years of the war and what the Jewish survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> required was not what they needed.</sentence><sentence id="692">And to give the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they were housed with the non-Jews special treatment, more food than the others got, better clothing than the others had gotten, more medical attention than the others received, would be unthinkable.</sentence><sentence id="693">It would, it could create riots, that the Jews were getting special treatment.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="694">Never mind that the Jews needed the special attention.</sentence><sentence id="695">It was the Jews who had suffered under the Nazi severely in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, not the foreign workers.</sentence><sentence id="696">But it was an impossible situation.</sentence><sentence id="697">So what Dean Harrison had recommended was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> should be set up with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span> as a model, that is they should be all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camps</span> and they should have a Jewish committee who would work together with whoever was in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> whether it would be uh a military group or an company or workers from the Joint Distribution Committee who were by now being permitted to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and to work in the camps, and General Eisenhower in that famous order of his of August 22nd also ordered that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> be made available for Jews alone, that non-Jews be removed from those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and sent back as quickly as possible to the homelands from which they had come.</sentence><sentence id="698">And that was a great step forward because that permitted additional special treatment for Jewish survivors.</sentence><sentence id="699">And when I came back to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, and I uh made my first recommendations, first orally to General Nicholson (ph), General Adcock and very quickly to General uh General Walter Beetle Smith, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff, later to be Ambassador of the United States to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> and Secretary of State, my first reports included a number of recommendations.</sentence><sentence id="700">One with regard to the crowding, that more and better <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> be obtained.</sentence><sentence id="701">Uh secondly, with regard to food, uh two thousand calories a day which was an improvement over what the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had gotten earlier under the American Army treatment, that two thousand calories a day was not sufficient to build up people who had been suffering from malnutrition for years.</sentence><sentence id="702">In addition, the two thousand calories did not provide sufficient nutrition.</sentence><sentence id="703">The diet was not a balanced diet.</sentence><sentence id="704">And I made another recommendation that was of vital importance to the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="705">Namely, that they saw that their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were surrounded by <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">Uh that irritated them to no end because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> under the Nazis, their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had also been surrounded by <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="707">Moreover, under the orders of General Patton, a pass system existed in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> under which no more than a certain percentage of Jews in the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="711">4 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> would get passes enabling them to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a certain number of hours.</sentence><sentence id="712">The Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> looked out and saw Germans who were, were the enemies of the Americans, Germans who had placed them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, walking freely on the <span class="DLF">roads</span>, on the <span class="DLF">highways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="713">They were not behind <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">They didn't have, have to ask anybody for a pass to walk around freely.</sentence><sentence id="715">They, the Jews, who had been so severely treated by the Germans, were still behind <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and had to ask for permission to have a few hours of freedom outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="716">Well, uh I must say that uh General Eisenhower acted quickly on all these recommendations.</sentence><sentence id="717">Orders were done quickly to General Patton to correct these situations and I had a uh vivid illustration of how at least in one instance if not in others, the orders were not carried out by General Patton.</sentence><sentence id="718">Generally speaking, had Eisenhower's orders beginning with his August 22nd initial order correcting the situation been carried out on all the lower levels of command, the situation for Jewish survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would have changed radically quickly.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="719">Unfortunately there was a wide gap between the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and the military units dealing with the Jewish displaced persons, and with all the intermediary levels through which the orders had to pass, including General Patton's <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="720">And so, for example, when I went back again on my second trip to Bavaria, the Jews complained to me that the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> still existed.</sentence><sentence id="721">The pass system had not been changed, and when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, I reported that to General Walter Beetle Smith.</sentence><sentence id="722">Soon afterwards I came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> to General Eisenhower Eisen-uh-hower's <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I saw General Patton sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> at eight o'clock in the morning when the Army day began in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I knew that I must be the reason for his being there.</sentence><sentence id="723">I had reported that he had not carried out Eisenhower's order with regard to the removal of the pass system and the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="724">I saw him sitting there with his pearl-handled pistols, one on each side of him, with his shiny helmet and boots.</sentence><sentence id="725">He glared at me with distaste and I beat a quick diplomatic retreat out of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="726">Later General Smith told me that what had happened was that when he had reported to Eisenhower that I had said that Patton had not carried out the orders about the removal of the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and the pass system, Eisenhower had instructed General Smith to call General Patton to have him report the following morning at eight o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="727">General Patton had to ride overnight from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to be there at eight o'clock in the morning, and later when General Eisenhower saw him, General Eisenhower said to Patton after reminding him of the barbed wire and the pass system and his not carrying out Eisenhower's orders with regard to them, General Eisenhower asked him, George, why don't you do something for these Jews?</sentence><sentence id="728">And General Patton replied thinking that he was talking to his buddy, his close friend with whom he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Point</span>, he replied uh Eisenhower, in a jocular way, well, why the hell should I. And Eisenhower lost his temper, which he normally kept under control, and retorted, well, God damn it, if for no other reason than because I have ordered you to.</sentence><sentence id="729">Now shortly after that General Patton was relieved of command of the 3rd Army and was given the command of the 15th Army, with <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="730">I don't know why that happened, but the 15th Army was only a paper Army.</sentence><sentence id="731">It consisted of no troops, only of the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="732">The general story as uh told by newspaper correspondents, the war correspondents and by the movie about General Patton, was that he had slapped a soldier in a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span>, charging him with malingering.</sentence><sentence id="733">But the question asks itself, why should Eisenhower have waited so long to punish Patton for something that had happened a long time before.</sentence><sentence id="734">I'm not saying that this incident of the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and pass system were the immediate cause of Patton's demotion, but I'm guessing that it may have played some part in it.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="739">Uh you were so involved in all of this, and you were going to the <span

this particular time is was Mosha (ph) , later Mosha (ph) .</sentence><sentence id="746">But I was situated at <span class="BUILDING">American Army headquarters</span> in <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="977">A: Well, by uh sheer accident, I was awarded the uh by the French government, the Croix de Guerre (ph) and I was asked to obtain the uh, oh I got--I see

after the ceremony with the award of the medal, and sometime before that--this explains how I knew that he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>--I had been asked by General Eisenhower's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to comment about a request they had received from a certain Mr. David Ben Gurion connected with the Jewish Agency for Palestine, who asked for permission to enter the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="985">And my comment was that it would be very valuable for permission to be granted because his very presence would raise the morale of the Jewish survivors in the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">So permission was granted.</sentence><sentence id="987">I called upon General Eisenhower at his <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on that day that I had come for the Croix de Guerre.</sentence><sentence id="988">I learned that he was scheduled to take the night American Army military train to <span

early.</sentence><sentence id="991">I found out that I was to uh be given a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with uh an American

he was to be on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and he said that he was to be uh in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> sitting up all night with uh American Army soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="994">So I went to see the captain commanding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and I said to him, do you see that man with a shock of white hair on the <span class="DLF">platform</span>.</sentence><sentence id="995">The uh captain said yes.</sentence><sentence id="996">I said his name is Ben Gurion.</sentence><sentence id="997">Does that mean anything to you?</sentence><sentence id="998">And uh, he David Ben Gurion's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> said no.</sentence><sentence id="999">I said well, uh he's the head of all the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1000">And he shouldn't be asked to sit up all night long in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1001">He said what do you want me to do.</sentence><sentence id="1002">I said well, you tell the other major in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> with me uh that there's an emergency, that there's a

unfortunate major departed.</sentence><sentence id="1004">David Ben Gurion then continued to ply me with questions about the Jewish displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="1005">The major thrust of his questions was, were these people who are completely broken, were they hospital cases?</sentence><sentence id="1006">Would they have mental problems for as long as they would live, or were they valuable human material who could become important citizens in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in the Jewish community?</sentence><sentence id="1007">And I assured him for, for from all that I had learned that they were indeed in the later category, that they survived because they were strong, that those who were weaker</sentence><sentence id="1009">0 unfortunately did not survive.</sentence><sentence id="1010">They were strong both physically and psychically.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And that was because of their strength and their will and their determination that they were able to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1012">We talked until two o'clock in the morning, until we both fell asleep.</sentence><sentence id="1013">In the morning I took him, after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> landed, after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived in, in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, I took him first to uh be registered,

introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, saying General Smith, if there were a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> now, I would be introducing the prime minister of that state.</sentence><sentence id="1019">That was uh no great feat on my part.</sentence><sentence id="1020">Of course Ben Gurion was the leading Jew of the Jewish community and it was a foregone conclusion that if there were to be a Jewish state, he would be at its head.</sentence><sentence id="1021">I was later told by General Smith that when he introduced him to General Eisenhower, that General Eisenhower was greatly impressed by this man, Ben Gurion, and that he reported to General Smith that he was very much taken by him.</sentence><sentence id="1022">He asked Ben Gurion to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and of course Ben Gurion had come for that purpose, and to report to General Eisenhower upon his findings after his tour would be over.</sentence><sentence id="1023">Well after I had introduced him to General Walter Beetle Smith, and we had had lunch, I took uh David Ben Gurion to his first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP

were accustomed to my coming in with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American Army vehicle</span>, and a number of them saw me come in this time too.</sentence><sentence id="1025">A few of them came over to say hello.</sentence><sentence id="1026">They happened to peer inside my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seat</span> and they saw something that was incredible to them.</sentence><sentence id="1027">They knew the picture of Ben Gurion, but they couldn't by the wildest stretch of their imagination imagine that he would be there in their camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1028">They began to scream "Ben Gurion, Ben Gurion.</sentence><sentence id="1029">As others heard the shouts, they came running, and I was afraid of a riot and I cried out, my friends, please show Ben Gurion the discipline of which you are capable.</sentence><sentence id="1030">You go around and tell all the people in the <span

and <span class="DLF">doors</span> were flung open so that people who couldn't get in, who couldn't fi...get even into the <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> which was completely full, could at least hear standing outside the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1037">And I came out to introduce Eisenhower.</sentence><sentence id="1038">As the two of us came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>, the large throng of people rose and the people began to sing the Hatikvah (ph) and as they sang the Hatikvah, many of them burst into weeping.</sentence><sentence id="1039">And I must confess that Eisenhower...that David Ben Gurion and I also wept for the Jews in that <span class="BUILDING">assembly hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1040">At that moment, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span>, their liberation was complete.</sentence><sentence id="1041">They had dreamed most of them of some day getting to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1042">Here, in the form of Ben Gurion, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> had come to them.</sentence><sentence id="1043">The Nazi nightmare was ended.</sentence><sentence id="1044">They were free.</sentence><sentence id="1045">They were now in touch with their brothers in

sob.</sentence><sentence id="1048">It was one of the most moving experiences in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1049">And to my dying day, I shall not forget it.</sentence><sentence id="1050">He then asked to meet with the leaders of the committee chosen by the residents of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zilesheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1051">The first time I had come to that <span

of the Jewish leaders of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zilesheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1053">Again he hurled questions at them.</sentence><sentence id="1054">Were they able to come to <span

had asked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, approximately three quarters of them wanted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1057">They wanted to</sentence><sentence id="1059">1 live for the first time in their lives as a majority in a in a Jewish country, that they could no longer be concerned about any future nightmare.</sentence><sentence

years later when he received an honorary degree at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Theological Seminary</span> of America, spoke of the fact that he and his brothers were raised by their mother on the stories of what he called the Old Testament, and he grew up believing that the Jews were indeed the chosen people.</sentence><sentence id="1212">And that they were the first to bring to humanity the divine message of ethics and morality.</sentence><sentence id="1213">I got to know him through the humanitarian approach that he took to the improvement of the Jewish survivors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1214">At the very beginning he cut through what was a gordion (ph) knot with which generals at <span class="BUILDING">American Army headquarters</span> were wrestling for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1215">The gordion knot consisted of the old question, who are the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1216">A question that has been given much attention by scholars of all kinds.</sentence><sentence id="1217">Are the Jews a nation?</sentence><sentence id="1218">Are they a religious grouping?Are they <span class="DLF">arace</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1219">Are they a people?</sentence><sentence id="1220">On the one hand it was argued that the Jews could not be given special attention in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> because you couldn't look upon them as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1221">There were either German nationals or Austrian nationals or Polish nationals or Czech nationals.</sentence><sentence id="1222">And if you were to look upon them as Jews and deprive them of their nationality, were you not doing the same thing that the Nazis had done, of robbing them of their citizenship, and looking upon them as a racial group.</sentence><sentence id="1223">On the other hand, how could you help them if you did not look upon them as a special separate group.</sentence><sentence id="1224">Well, Eisenhower cut through that gordion knot and when he received these several communications from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, from General Marshall, from Secretary Stimpson, and I must stress from President Truman, that the situation must be corrected, Eisenhower at once made up his mind he was going to stop with all of this argument, all of this debate, and he was going to treat the Jews as a separate group.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And German Jews and Austrian Jews and Italian Jews were no longer to be enemy nationals, but victims, and to be treated as victims of the Nazis and the Jews who didn't want to go back to their homelands, they were to be treated as a special group, given special help, brought back to the level of ordinary common place health of human beings and because he did that, I credit him with the speedy rehabilitation of the Jewish survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1226">He came to speak at the <span class="BUILDING">Park Avenue Synagogue</span> at my invitation in May of 1965.</sentence><sentence id="1227">By that time he had been President of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gettysburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1228">I telephoned him and I asked him would he come to speak at a special service at my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> commemorating the 20th anniversary of the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> by the American Army under his command.</sentence><sentence id="1229">He agreed to come.</sentence><sentence id="1230">In introducing him to my congregation, I said to them, I want to tell you one story about this man which will be sufficient to tell you about his character, his humanitarianism, and his answer to the difficult Jewish problem.</sentence><sentence id="1231">I said when we, when the German arm...when the American Army liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, there were definitions of who was a displaced person.</sentence><sentence id="1232">Who was a displaced person who would benefit from <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>, food, clothing and all the rest under the aegis of the American Army.</sentence><sentence id="1233">The displaced person was defined as a survivor, in this case particularly a Jewish survivor, liberated in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> on <span class="REGION">German soil</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1234">But soon there came into the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, other Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1235">Jews who had been in hiding in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1236">Jews who had been shoved back by the Russians behind the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, all the way back to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, an action that actually saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="1237">Now these</sentence><sentence id="1239">3 Jews came back in large numbers from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1240">They found that their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and their <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> could not be reclaimed.</sentence><sentence id="1241">They discovered that their loved ones had been murdered by the Nazis and the Polish or Ukrainian or Lithuanian helpers and they no longer wanted to try to make out, to make a new life where they had originally lived.</sentence><sentence id="1242">And spontaneously they started a trek from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, later organized and assisted by the men and women of the Brichah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1279">Q: How did Eisenhower react to this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1281">A: Ah, this is a major point that I wanted to make.</sentence><sentence id="1282">When these Jews started coming across the <span class="DLF">borders</span> to enter the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, Eisenhower was asked by the commanders on lower levels, what shall we do with these refugees who are coming into our <span class="REGION">zone</span> in such large numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1283">I was asked for a recommendation.</sentence><sentence id="1284">The recommendation of course was that they be admitted into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1285">General Eisenhower approved that recommendation.</sentence><sentence id="1286">Eighty thousand Jews came in, and Eisenhower, by that one order of approval, contributed to the saving of eighty thousand Jewish lives.</sentence><sentence id="1287">Now my friendship with him continued after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1288">I was asked to help write items of interest in his campaign for the presidency, such as his Rosh Hashanah message during the campaign.</sentence><sentence id="1289">My wife and I were invited to the <span class="BUILDING">Inauguration</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1290">Before that time I was invited to give an invocation at the Republican National Convention that had that had nominated him.</sentence><sentence id="1291">I had him at my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, but before that I had visited him at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gettysburg</span> at his <span class="DLF">farm</span>, so we remained in close contact all through the years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1303">Q: How did Eisenhower, did you and Eisenhower at the time you made this recommendation, did you talk to him face to face?</sentence><sentence id="1304">What did he say to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1307">A: I did not in most instances have the opportunity of speaking to him face to face.</sentence><sentence id="1308">I did often.</sentence><sentence id="1309">I did have the privilege of coming to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, speaking to him face to face, most of the times answering his questions.</sentence><sentence id="1310">When he was not in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and that was, that occurred frequently, he would be out on a field trip, then my conversations were with the second in command, his chief of staff General Walter Beetle Smith.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1315">Q: Did Eisenhower ever talk to you about the Jews and his feelings about Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1317">A: I did have occasion to hear such remarks from Eisenhower.</sentence><sentence id="1318">He always spoke in an affirmative fashion.</sentence><sentence id="1319">He always condemned every kind of bigotry and prejudice.</sentence><sentence id="1320">He hated what the Nazis had done.</sentence><sentence id="1321">He issued orders, after he had first visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, that American military commanders should bring their units to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> so that the troops might know what they had been fighting against.</sentence><sentence id="1322">He visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span> on Yom Kippur, spoke to the Jews assembled there, told them of his high admiration for them, for the Jewish people and for Judaism, and urged them to keep their hope high, that they still had a future.</sentence><sentence id="1323">Eisenhower was that kind of personality.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1331">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="1332">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1333">When you had been relieved of your post and Judge Rifkin came in your <span class="NPIP">place</span>, uh what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1341">A: Well the first thing I did was to escort Judge Rifkin on a tour of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, to introduce him to all of my contacts among the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, to tell them that he was the person for them to speak to afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1342">I returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop transport</span> and uh I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the end of November, beginning of December in 1945.Before my return I had been visited at my <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> by uh Major Edward Warburg (ph) who was at that time the president of the Joint Distribution Committee, and he was good enough to invite me.</sentence><sentence id="1343">After I would be discharged from the Army, to become a member of the staff of the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="1344">He even suggested that I would be appointed Director of JDC operations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, after I would spend at least a month or so with my family back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1345">But I returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1346">Soon afterwards I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1347">I was full of vehement indignation at what I had seen.</sentence><sentence id="1348">I had, I contrasted that with what I had found among American Jews when I returned.</sentence><sentence id="1349">There was very little awareness among American Jews of what had happened to their fellow Jews in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1350">Very few were aware of it, and very few were concerned about it, naturally, because they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1351">So I was angry and at my uh, I was asked to speak at the annual meeting of the JDC and I'm afraid that I gave voice to my anger at that meeting, but to my surprise I was asked to give an address the following week at the annual meeting of the United Jewish Appeal to take place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> where an unheard of goal was to be proclaimed, a goal of $100,000,000 to be raised during 1946 among the Jews of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1352">Of course I uh accepted the invitation.</sentence><sentence id="1353">I addressed the UJA Conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> the following week, and I was asked the next morning to have breakfast with the leaders of the JDC and the UJA who were there at that conference, and at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">breakfast table</span> I was told that I was being relieved of the employment I was to have with the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="1354">Instead I was asked to accept employment with the United Jewish Appeal and to be a speaker for the hundred million dollar campaign from which of course the JDC would be receiving its funds.</sentence><sentence id="1355">And I agreed and for the next six months I spoke in forty different states of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1356">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> I could call my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1357">I just went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and spoke at UJA fund raising meetings.</sentence><sentence id="1358">According to the calculations that I kept myself, some $20,000,000 were raised at those meetings.</sentence><sentence id="1359">The JDC then asked me to return to Europe, to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, once again to bring myself up to date on what had happened and then to go to <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> where I was to spend four months in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span>, what were then called Southern and Northern Rhodesia, now <span class="COUNTRY">Zimbabwe</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Zambia</span>, and to raise funds there for the South African Jewish War Appeal, the agency that then transmitted its funds to the Joint Distribution Committee for work among the Jewish survivors in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1360">I spent a brief while in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I met the young lady at that time to whom I became engaged after three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1362">Sadly I departed on my mission for the JDC to Europe, from there to <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> where I met the most generous Jews I had as yet met in my career.</sentence><sentence id="1363">South African Jews gave generously, very generously, and I made friends among them, friends to this day, and similarly with the Jews, the few Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Zimbabwe</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Zambia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I went as far north as what was then called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Livingston</span>, in <span class="REGION">northern Rhodesia</span> and now <span class="COUNTRY">Zambia</span>, and of course as far south as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Capetown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1365">And I spoke in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and dork (ph) in which there were seventy Jews or more.</sentence><sentence id="1366">And happily the South African Jewish War Appeal reported that the campaign was very successful.</sentence><sentence id="1367">I returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1368">I got married, happily, and then I worked for the United Jewish Appeal in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> campaign for six months.</sentence><sentence id="1369">Then tired of not having had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for myself for a good number of years, my wife and I settled down in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brookline</span>, <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span>, where I</sentence><sentence id="1371">5 accepted a
