<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: Do you remember any specific holidays as a -- in your early childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="50">Any memories of those?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Oh yes, I remember very vividly going to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on Simchas Torah, and the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> is Conservative Orthodox, you know, where of course, the women sat upstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and the men were worshipping downstairs and as children we were with the men, as boys.</sentence><sentence id="57">And I remember that holiday so well because during the service, the mothers would throw candy down from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, and my brother and I did everything we could to gather up as much of it as we could.</sentence><sentence id="58">It was a delight, and I remember it very fondly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: What about <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ritual, did you observe the Shabbat or Passover?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: Yes, we observed Shabbat and it was a kosher f -- <span class="BUILDING">kosher house</span>, and certainly observed the Passover.</sentence><sentence id="65">And for any child, of course, Hanukkah was the m -- was a major holiday and that was always celebrated.</sentence><sentence id="66">And one of the things that I do also remember, going to my grandparents" <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they lived in a -- what I could best describe as a -- looked like a browns -- what a brownstone would look like today.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="67">They lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">lower floors</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">yard</span> in the back, rectangular <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">It was walled in on three sides, but at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">And in that little <span class="DLF">yard</span>, which was just delightful, there was a -- always a sukkah.</sentence><sentence id="70">So on the holiday of Sukkos we would go there and I would marvel at all the interesting things that were hung from the sukkah and the -- and then we went to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> from there, and so those were my recollections really, of the holidays.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="76">Did you live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> or were there -- was it mixed?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: I would say i-it -- where we lived it was mixed, very, very much so mixed.</sentence><sentence id="78">My grandparents -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutz</span> was the -- where they lived was a -- for I guess going back many hundreds of years must have been kind of a ghetto for Jews, a Jewish -- a Jewish area.</sentence><sentence id="79">I -- I don't think it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the common sense today, but it was an <span class="REGION">area</span> that was populated mostly by Jews, and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with -- the <span class="BUILDING">Cologne synagogue</span> was there, the -- one of the major ones was right in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, very near by.</sentence><sentence id="80">So they were more -- in a-- in a more Jewish area and my parents and we lived in -- in a more modern area of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: What -- what <span class="DLF">street</span> did you live on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="87">A: [remember it very well, it-- the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was the univeri(ph) -- <span class="DLF">Universitat strasse</span>, <span class="DLF">University street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">And we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on either the first or <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>, I don't quite recall whether i -- whether it was right on -- no, it was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>, I'm sure of that.</sentence><sentence id="89">And across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a very large <span class="DLF">park</span>, and -- which was very interesting for my brother and I. We would look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> on -- particularly on weekends and all kinds of interesting things happened.</sentence><sentence id="90">Hot air balloons would be -- would be launched from there, and of course there were a multitude of parades, with military music and the -- and the Nazi youth and all of that, which was for a child at least, an eye opener, interesting to see.</sentence><sentence id="91">We never really were</sentence><sentence id="93">a part of that, as you would understand, but we could see it all going on.</sentence><sentence id="94">It was quite colorful, and -- and interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: You were obviously quite young then.</sentence><sentence id="105">Did it mean anything to you to see these Nazi parades with these flags and uniforms?</sentence><sentence id="106">Or what did it mean to you as a young -- very young child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: Well, we were pretty well indoctrinated as to what the Nazis were doing.</sentence><sentence id="111">Our parents did not keep any secrets from us.</sentence><sentence id="112">And we were -- it was there, we felt totally apart from it.</sentence><sentence id="113">We felt as though we were not welcome to join it.</sentence><sentence id="114">This was for Germans and that Jews were not welcome in these -- in these circles, or at least in this crowd.</sentence><sentence id="115">And although we looked on it with interest, and possibly as a child with longing to be a part of something, we knew that it was beyond us to be able to be a part of it.</sentence><sentence id="116">Just wasn't possible, and did we feel ostracized by it?</sentence><sentence id="117">I don't think so, not in that way.</sentence><sentence id="118">I think my feelings were that it would be nice if we could be a part of all of this, but no, it was -- it was not -- it was not to be and there was too much fear attendant to trying to be a part of that.</sentence><sentence id="119">We knew we wouldn't --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Because?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: We knew we wouldn't be welcome.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: How did you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Well, we had any number of personalized experiences in that -- this was a time when we started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and we were -- we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, which I think</sentence><sentence id="127">wa-was already at that time forbidden for Jews to go to the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> or to the -- to other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, we had to be in separate <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">And in those <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, walking <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, we were often chased by Nazi youth.</sentence><sentence id="129">We made it our business to stay out of their way as much as we could because we knew that they would taunt us as we went from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">But it didn't happen all that frequently, just, you know, once -- oh, it's so difficult for me to remember how often, but it did -- it -- all that has to do is happen once and you remember it, as a child.</sentence><sentence id="131">And we did, we just -- my brother and I learned how to run very fast and we ran.</sentence><sentence id="132">We went -- ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and that was that, when they bother us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: You -- you used the expression Germans and Jews.</sentence><sentence id="143">Did you not feel German in any way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: I didn't have a sense of nationality, not at that age.</sentence><sentence id="147">I kn-knew we lived in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we lived in, which was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Deutschland</span>, that was our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, but my association was that we were really not a part of it because of our Jewishness.</sentence><sentence id="148">My parents I don't think had that feeling so much.</sentence><sentence id="149">They felt themselves as being German.</sentence><sentence id="150">And -- but they made it clear to us how unwelcome the Jews were and I -- there were other incidents that I can relate to you where I was -- where I recall how they tried to d---to keep Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="151">So, did I feel German?</sentence><sentence id="152">I knew I was there, I had no sense of nationality, I was perhaps too young to have that sense of nationality.</sentence><sentence id="153">I do know that I was very much interested in geography.</sentence><sentence id="154">My parents spoke often of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and</sentence><sentence id="156">that was very interesting for us.</sentence><sentence id="157">You know, where is <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and what is happening there, and why is it so great, and -- because they made it sound very, very interesting, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="158">And then we learned ab -- all about -- my father was -- tr-traveled a lot.</sentence><sentence id="159">So when he was <span class="NPIP">abroad</span> and he -- all those years, even during the Nazi period, he was traveling in <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he told us about his trips.</sentence><sentence id="160">And this was all very fascinating for us.</sentence><sentence id="161">So, we were in -- I never really had a -- you -- to get back to your original question, I never had a sense of nationality at the time.</sentence><sentence id="162">Fascinating interest with the world and different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, but no sense of nationalism.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: We spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="184">That was the only language that we knew.</sentence><sentence id="185">Just to step back, which gives you an idea of the -- the way I became aware of being a Jew, and how unwelcome we really were, not just from what my parents said, but you would go to <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> or look, and you would see signs in the <span class="DLF">store windows</span>, Jews ungerwurnscht(ph), not wanted.</sentence><sentence id="186">And you felt strange going into those <span class="BUILDING">shops</span>, although shopkeepers often didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="187">They -- they welcomed you because they -- you were after all, a client, you were going to spend some money and they would happily sell you things.</sentence><sentence id="188">But the signs, nevertheless were in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and in the <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">One in particular I think goes back.</sentence><sentence id="190">We used to go to a <span class="DLF">beach</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> and my mother took the two of us, Norbert and myself there quite frequently during the summers and we would enjoy bathing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">I wanted to learn how to swim.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p><p><sentence id="196">March 10, 2001 The interesting thing is how they taught swimming in those days, they put the student on a long string attached to its waist and on a pole and just held them there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> so that they'd learn how to swim.</sentence><sentence id="197">We were too young for that, but we had the wish to learn how and be a part of that.</sentence><sentence id="198">Anyway, we'd go to the -- to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> quite frequently, and it was a lot of fun.</sentence><sentence id="199">Kids love that, and we loved it.</sentence><sentence id="200">Then one day we went and there was a sign, Juden ungerwurnscht(ph) and my mother -- and I s-saw the sign and my mother pointed it out to us and she went to the proprietor of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> and se -- and said, what does this mean?</sentence><sentence id="201">I mean, we've been coming here for years.</sentence><sentence id="202">Oh, oh, no, it -- she said, this doesn't apply to you, you can -- you can come, but you know, we have to have these signs.</sentence><sentence id="203">So although we -- we went, the comfort level of going there suddenly went down several s -- degrees -- more than several degrees, quite a lot and we learned at a young age that we were somehow different, that because we were Jews, we were not part of the general public in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="204">We learned it also when we took trips with my parents on weekends to go to -- th-the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> has got many, many interesting historical sites and <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> etcetera, which children love to see, and we would go there and often there would be the sign, no Jews allowed.</sentence><sentence id="205">We sometimes ignored those signs and sometimes it was a little too uncomfortable and we just went -- did not go there, or my parents chose not to go there.</sentence><sentence id="206">Perhaps they knew where they were serious about not having Jews and where they weren't.</sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> overall was not -- I don't think the people in the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="210"><span class="COUNTRY">Rhineland</span> were all that much in love with the Hitler era, that administration, and many of them did not agree with what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="211">But nevertheless, they had to live their lives and they did what they were told, as all good Germans did in those days, but still found ways to tolerate the Jews who lived amongst them.</sentence><sentence id="212">Except for a few.</sentence><sentence id="213">Obviously there were always those who were rabid Nazis and who you had to stay out of their way of and -- and for me as a child, particularly the -- the youngsters who were part of the Hitler youth, who m-made it their business if they did s-see Jews to at least taunt them, if not physically assault them.</sentence><sentence id="214">I don't remember ever being physically assaulted, but we did lead fairly normal lives as children, aside from this discrimination.</sentence><sentence id="215">My brother and I used to -- we found our way to the <span class="BUILDING">circus</span> once.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">When we were supposed to be coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we wanted the circus so badly we hopped aboard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> and went out to the circus.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">And of course my mother was beside herself, why didn't the boys come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="218">But those are the kinds of events I think that most children do.</sentence><sentence id="219">You could do this and there was no fear that somebody would harm you and take you away or steal you, or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="220">You could -- we -- we felt no danger in doing those things.</sentence><sentence id="221">Perhaps my parents were concerned, but my brother and I were not.</sentence><sentence id="222">Then of course, things got a little bit more dicey and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Okay, we -- we'll get to that in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="224">Talking about you and your brother, how would you describe yourself?</sentence><sentence id="225">Were you a -- it sounds like you were a little</sentence></p><p><sentence id="228">independent child there.</sentence><sentence id="229">W-Were you, or were you different from your brother, or how would you characterize each of you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Well we were -- we were close as youngsters, so we did everything together and when we had a desire to do something, at least we had somebody to do it with.</sentence><sentence id="231">So, we were adventuresome.</sentence><sentence id="232">I don't think that we were abnormally risque.</sentence><sentence id="233">We did the things we wanted to, but we also hewed to being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- and doing our studies and listening to the things that we needed to, listen to our parents, and when they said ja--do your homework, we did our homework and all those things.</sentence><sentence id="234">So we were not wild, as such, but we had our moments when we wanted to go out and have some fun, and we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: Were you an athletic child?</sentence><sentence id="241">A physically strong child?</sentence></p></dialogue>

get these permissions to get across to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, th-the health certificate?</sentence><sentence id="570">They said oh, you can't get them, you might just as well go back.</sentence><sentence id="571">And he said no, how can we -- then he insisted.</sentence><sentence id="572">He said, well you have to see the [indecipherable] I guess, the county executive or whatever in that <span class="REGION">area</span> and he can do it.</sentence><sentence id="573">Well, where can I find him?</sentence><sentence id="574">And he said well, he's in such and such a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="575">And my father took off to get that.</sentence><sentence id="576">In the meantime we stayed there at the <span class="DLF">border</span> with my mother and they tore our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> apart.</sentence><sentence id="577">Literally went through everything to see whether we had anything at all.</sentence><sentence id="578">And as my mother tells it, we had -- we had gotten some gifts from some friends or relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, the coats and hats and my Aunt Selma had put some perfume in the hatband, and they found that, of course, and confiscated it, which made Norbert and I very upset that they would take that away from us.</sentence><sentence id="579">And my</sentence><sentence id="581">Interview with Alfred Schnog 8 March 10, 2001 mother said, don't you worry about it, whatever it is, we can replace it.</sentence><sentence id="582">Let them have it.</sentence><sentence id="583">And we waited for my father to come back.</sentence><sentence id="584">Well, as the story goes, my father told me, he said he went to see him and he was occupied somewhere and insisted he go in and see this county executive, and he walked into his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and he gave him a quick heil Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="585">And he said, why can't I go across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, I have my children, they have -- we have polio in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and they insist on having the certificate.</sentence><sentence id="586">And so the fellow said well, you know, if you don't mind, you know, they -- they have polio here in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="587">If you don't object to your children being exposed to that, then why should we, and he signed it, gave it to him.</sentence><sentence id="588">So he came back to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and there we were, everything had been stripped and taken and it was quite late by then.</sentence><sentence id="589">And the -- the Germans were furious, of course, that he had come up with the certificate, they didn't want him to -- didn't want to give him that opportunity that -- to leave.</sentence><sentence id="590">And even though it was very late, the -- and the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span> supposedly had closed.</sentence><sentence id="591">So they thought that maybe this was all over, we couldn't get in any more.</sentence><sentence id="592">And the German said, okay, you can go, with a smirk on their faces, I guess, knowing that the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="593">Well, lo and behold, they started drive across and the Dutch opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> and they said, what was going on there?</sentence><sentence id="594">And they said, you know, we seen a lot of this with Jews.</sentence><sentence id="595">We kept the <span class="DLF">border</span> open for you.</sentence><sentence id="596">So the Dutch were extremely decent and wonderful people and we went over and for the next month or</sentence><sentence id="598">six weeks we stayed in a -- kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span> on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="599"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sunfort</span> was the name of the reso -- the -- the <span

here.</sentence><sentence id="731">And we got up and she took us to the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and stood us between the drapes so that we could look out on the s -- onto the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="732">And down below was this noise of shattering glass and -- and we looked down and we saw these uniformed individuals, the brown shirts, throwing rocks into the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that was just across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">And there were others inside the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> throwing porcelain and glass out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, just piling it up, just heaving it out.</sentence><sentence id="734">And I remember the -- in the glow of the streetlights, in the yellowish glow of the streetlights and the cobblestone <span class="DLF">streets</span> and all this stuff just shattering as it hit the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">And my mother said to me -- sa-said to us, boys, she said, take a look.</sentence><sentence id="736">Never forget what you see here.</sentence><sentence id="737">And of course we wanted to know what was happening and we asked what's happening, and she said, that's a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="738">One of the finest <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in crystal and everything and they're just destroying it.</sentence><sentence id="739">Well, we didn't know -- what we didn't know was that not just there, but everywhere, this was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and this was the night that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were all burned and the -- what</sentence><sentence id="741">we didn't see, the -- the Jews being rounded up and being ostracized and as they were dragged down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and all these things.</sentence><sentence id="742">These were things that we learned only afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="743">But we did see the carnage that was taking place across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and down this -- this whole <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">And in -- it's something that I don't think I can ever forget, the image of it is so vivid in my mind, the whole thing, it's -- it was the first time in all those years that we actually saw violence.</sentence><sentence id="745">We had seen and we had feared all the other things, but this was true violence.</sentence><sentence id="746">And it -- and you know, I've read a lot about these things since then.</sentence><sentence id="747">The Germans claimed afterwards that it was an uprising on the part of the German people against the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="748">Just remembering all those people in uniform, it was no uprising of the people in, I mean it was the -- it was the -- the Hitler youth, the -- the SA, the brown shirts and whoever else wanted to participate in this, did this.</sentence><sentence id="749">Anyway, in the morning my parents took us to vi-- say goodbye to our grandparents, who were just across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">And the grandparents said, my God are you still here?</sentence><sentence id="751">Get out, get out.</sentence><sentence id="752">And then we learned of the carnage that had been happening the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and obviously what was happening all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="753">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> had been burned, the people had been dragged out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they made fun of them as they -- down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="754">Elderly people, and -- and they sent us off.</sentence><sentence id="755">They shooed us out, but quickly, and said get out.</sentence><sentence id="756">And so my parents went directly to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> from there and we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="757">There were a lot of other Jews on</sentence><sentence id="759">&gt;&gt; Interview with Alfred Schnog March 10, 2001 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">Many of them had come from the east, finding their way through.</sentence><sentence id="761">And some of them had, as we found out a few days later, some of them who were actually on their way to emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were also on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="762">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took off.</sentence><sentence id="763">What we didn't know, which we learned shortly thereafter is that the Germans has sealed the <span class="DLF">borders</span> everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="764">And we arrived at the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">Police boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="766">All Jews, out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="767">And we were all taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, all our baggage off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> without a horse, and we were marched to a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="768">Best thing I could describe it as, and locked up in a -- in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="769">I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> vividly, there we-were quite a number of people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="770">And I remember the green <span class="DLF">door</span> and the bars on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in the open, which was to be used by everybody there and of course as children having to use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in front of all these people was something we didn't like, and I remember the-they shielded us when we had to do so.</sentence><sentence id="771">And we were there for a period of time, I'm not sure how long.</sentence><sentence id="772">My father had some papers with him and in -- it-- and he was concerned that the Germans might see those papers and misinterpret them or find them, and he ate them.</sentence><sentence id="773">And for my brother and I, this was a marvel to see.</sentence><sentence id="774">I think maybe made a big impression on us more-so than even going to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> is that my father would eat paper.</sentence><sentence id="775">And these are -- it's funny, the things that you rec-recollect.</sentence><sentence id="776">And sometime within that day or the next day -- it seemed to me it was</sentence><sentence id="778">just one night that we spent there, but my parents have often said it was almost a week, and I don't recall that.</sentence><sentence id="779">I think it was just -- I think it was just that -- that night.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="836">Q: Were -- were there other children, or were you boys the only ones?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="838">A: I believe we were the only boys.</sentence><sentence id="839">There were a lot -- there were other people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">Some of them were single men and single women, you know, these were groups.</sentence><sentence id="841">Husband and wife maybe, perhaps families as well.</sentence><sentence id="842">And at one point I guess we ha -- my father had an opportunity to speak to the commandant there of -- whoever he was.</sentence><sentence id="843">And he explained to him that he was traveling here on business.</sentence><sentence id="844">He had this document from -- still -- the Reichsbank, and that he had -- was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to bid on some very important materials which were needed for the -- the war effort in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or for the military, and they couldn't keep us incarcerated because he had to get on with this business.</sentence><sentence id="845">And the man apparently told them well, you know, I have to see -- I -- first thing I have to do is feed 3,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="846">He said, we'll take care of you after that's done.</sentence><sentence id="847">But apparently, coincidentally, the -- there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> sailing from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which had booked passage for about a thousand Jews who had permission to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="848">The Aidam(ph) was the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="849">And apparently this was made known to the German authorities there and they didn't want to create a situation -- at least we think they didn't want to create a situation where there would become known that they prevented Jews from leaving.</sentence><sentence id="850">It would have been politically unwise, maybe created</sentence><sentence id="852">too much of a public relations problem for them.</sentence><sentence id="853">So they decided to let those Jews who had that passage booked, and pay for us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to catch that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, it was sailing from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, to go.</sentence><sentence id="854">And my father said, well look, I have my papers for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="855">Didn't have any passage on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="856">And somehow he managed to get us in with this group to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="857">And it was just, I think, good fortune.</sentence><sentence id="858">There was a point just before we went into this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where we -- where my mother and father were told by the -- whoever was leading us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ersatz concentration camp</span> that they had put up, or that -- this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where they were going, where they were apparently separating or segregating people, where they were going to put them and what have you, assign them to some <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="859">And they said to my parents, they said look, you will go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> where you will be safe.</sentence><sentence id="860">Your children will go to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="861">And of course the minute Norbert and I heard this -- and I recall that too -- we started to raise the <span class="DLF">roof</span> because we were not going to be separated from our parents.</sentence><sentence id="862">This was -- we were just, I guess frightened.</sentence><sentence id="863">And I mean, really scared that we might be separated from them.</sentence><sentence id="864">And my mother said, children calm down.</sentence><sentence id="865">Nobody is going to separate us from anybody.</sentence><sentence id="866">Before that happens, I will take your lives and mine right here.</sentence><sentence id="867">And she made it known, she was very distinct about it, and she always carried a -- through her lifetime she always carried a paring knife, which she used to peel apples, cause she loved apples.</sentence><sentence id="868">And she was fully prepared to take that knife and cut our throats and her own throat so that</sentence><sentence id="870">that wouldn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="871">And it wasn't so strange, because there were people who attempted suicide in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> because they had lost everything, they knew they were going to be sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, back where they came from.</sentence><sentence id="872">And there were any number of suicide attempts, some of them perhaps successful, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="873">Anyway, that was -- in that moment, I don't know what made the Germans say forget about it, or go on with your -- the way I heard it my mother said, go on, take your brats and get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="874">I'm not sure that that was the case, cause I don't remember that, but it could very well have been.</sentence><sentence id="875">And we went -- we were then on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with all these other people, or we went to the <span class="DLF">border</span> with all these other people to cross to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

be in the army, to be a part of this, to fight as a soldier in-- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1934">Not -- not that we had any feeling because we immigrated and we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we had to do this, but simply because we were patriotic Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1935">Extremely patriotic, as was everybody in those

to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and they looked up a couple who was -- they had run the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>, I guess, there.</sentence><sentence id="1953">And they went and asked about them, and they still were running a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1954">And they went over there to -- and they looked in the <span

back.</sentence><sentence id="1960">How are you?</sentence><sentence id="1961">Tell me, how did you survive?</sentence><sentence id="1962">And they were, as my mother said, very decent people caught up in this horror story with the Germans, they -- many of them couldn't do anything out of fear that something would happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="1963">Indeed, my father tells the story about a man who couldn't keep his mouth shut, he says, and he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deutz</span> near my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="1964">He was Christian, he hated the

do?</sentence><sentence id="1967">They caught him, they cut his head off.</sentence><sentence id="1968">So that kind of terror visited on a population brings about so much fear, that people shrink away.</sentence><sentence id="1969">No wonder they put signs in their <span class="DLF">windows</span>, no Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1970">If they didn't, God knows what would have happened to them, in their own minds.</sentence><sentence id="1971">So there were a lot of -- a lot of Germans who didn't willingly participate in this, who did so I think out of fear, and what reprisals might be visited on them.</sentence><sentence id="1972">There were some of course, who went right along with it, who -- who thought Hitler was the last word and you know, this is -- this is the new Siegfried, the -- the hero of German mythology is going to -- th-the vag -- the Wagner people, all this romanticism that really isn't romanticism, it's just pure Germanic.</sentence><sentence id="1973">And those

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2003">A: Oh, interesting, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2004">When my parents arrived here they immediately applied for citizenship and it was a five year waiting period.</sentence><sentence id="2005">Five years passed and they were</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2008">Interview with Alfred Schnog me March 10, 2001 called before a judge and I re-remember going with them before the judge and the swearing in.</sentence><sentence id="2009">And they were just thrilled, as I was, and -- to become an American citizen.</sentence><sentence id="2010">This was a dream that had come true for them.</sentence><sentence id="2011">And shortly thereafter, we -- my brother and I became citizens by derivation.</sentence><sentence id="2012">So we also were called and we were sworn in.</sentence><sentence id="2013">And I, of course, have that certificate and it's something we're all very proud of, and we -- listen, this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> saved our lives.</sentence><sentence id="2014">The fact that we got over here may have been pure luck, or it may have been God's doing.</sentence><sentence id="2015">I don't think it was that, I think it was just plain luck and a little bit of fortitude and a little bit of courage on the part of my father, and seeing what was happening and -- well, but to escape so many times from -- slip though at the last moment, always the last to arrive before the <span class="DLF">doors</span> shut, is something that amazes me.</sentence><sentence id="2016">I am now probably the only survivor of my immediate family because my brother passed away at 54, he had pancreatic cancer and died.</sentence><sentence id="2017">My mother died in -- when she was 90 -- 91 -- 90 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2018">My father died of the Alzheimer's disease in -- when he was 84.</sentence><sentence id="2019">But I often ask myself, you know, why am I here longer than the other?</sentence><sentence id="2020">Why ar -- why aren't there more of us who managed it?</sentence><sentence id="2021">But you -- when I think about some of the stories that you read about people who don't believe or who refuse to accept the fact that there was a Holocaust at all, it's something that I don't -- 1-- number one, I don't understand it.</sentence><sentence id="2022">Number two, I ga -- these are the kinds of people -- the kinds of people who -- who -- whose thought process is so shallow, the same one who Hitler was able to -- to inveigle to</sentence><sentence id="2024">Interview with Alfred Schnog m March 10, 2001 bring into his party.</sentence><sentence id="2025">That's -- that's a horror and so anything that -- you know, history is something that lives only with people who have lived it themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2026">Those that haven't, except for the few who educate themselves, who will read history and will be able to understand it, for -- except for those, people not only forget, but it has no meaning for them.</sentence><sentence id="2027">They read a history book.</sentence><sentence id="2028">There was World War I, it lasted from this date to that date.</sentence><sentence id="2029">This is what s -- took place, but it means nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2030">It means absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2031">When I was a child I talked to my grandfather and I asked him about World War I. My grandfather served in the German army in World War I, and he told me stories.</sentence><sentence id="2032">He told me the story one day of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> that came and dropped two bombs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, and I was impressed.</sentence><sentence id="2033">But World War I had no meaning to me.</sentence><sentence id="2034">Not from what was relayed to me.</sentence><sentence id="2035">It meant nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2036">World War II, yes, had every meaning.</sentence><sentence id="2037">I was too closely involved.</sentence><sentence id="2038">You know, look at our children today.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2039">They look back and they come to me and they want to know a little bit about World War II, I can tell them certain things about World War II, but it won't have any meaning for them.</sentence><sentence id="2040">They are much closer to the last war we fought in, the <span class="DLF">desert</span> or in perhaps <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> if they're a little older and went through that era.</sentence><sentence id="2041">But even that passes, and if they don't inform themselves and don't reach back and read the history and in -- get involved a little bit more closely into what -- perhaps into people's lives, or into -- there have been some wonderful books written about World War IL.</sentence><sentence id="2042">If they don't read that, or if they -- if you haven't read "All Quiet on the <span class="REGION">Western Front</span>," you</sentence><sentence id="2044">would not really understand the abhorrence of war that came out of World War I.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2045">And I think that's missing today and much of that is missing and it's too bad, it really is and I think this is the kind of thing that fosters the thoughts that the Holocaust never happened.</sentence><sentence id="2046">And it sure did.</sentence><sentence id="2047">There was one other vignette that's rather interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2048">A few years ago, here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, my parents were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and my mother -- I came down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> to go to attend an affair of some sort.</sentence><sentence id="2049">I've forgotten whether it was a formal affair or whether we were just going out for -- for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="2050">And I was over at her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, we were chatting and I was getting dressed.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2051">I was staying with her.</sentence><sentence id="2052">And I had forgotten to bring my cufflinks.</sentence><sentence id="2053">And I said, Mom, you know, I don't have any cufflinks, did Dad have any?</sentence><sentence id="2054">And she said yeah, yeah, wait a minute, I have something for you.</sentence><sentence id="2055">And she brought out a pair of silver cufflinks.</sentence><sentence id="2056">She said these -- these will do fine.</sentence><sentence id="2057">And I looked at them and I said, yes they will, where'd Dad get these?</sentence><sentence id="2058">She said, well, it's an interesting story, I have to tell you about it.</sentence><sentence id="2059">And she said, when your father was young, about to be Bar- Mitzvahed, 13 years old, there was a -- your grandfather, Arnold, rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to a German soldier, an officer.</sentence><sentence id="2060">And he used that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to entertain his girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="2061">And he was a very nice gentleman and he knew your father was being Bar- Mitzvahed, so he purchased those cufflinks for your father as a Bar-Mitzvah gift.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2062">And, she said to me, you'd be interested in knowing the name of that German officer.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2063">And I said, yeah, well who was he?</sentence><sentence id="2064">She said, his name was von Stauffenberg.</sentence><sentence id="2065">And I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2068">Interview with Alfred Schnog (r) March 10, 2001 star -- I was startled; von Stauffenberg was the general who took part in the assassination attempt against Hitler in the latter stages of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2069">So history touches you, no matter <span class="NPIP">where</span> you are, at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> or another, and here in a pair of cufflinks, it reaches back and it touches you.</sentence><sentence id="2070">And it's these kinds of stories that make history alive.</sentence><sentence id="2071">I hope I can pass all these things on to my children that they" 1] remember it.</sentence><sentence id="2072">I don't know whether I -- I have myself been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on several occasions.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2073">I've been there on business and I've met people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2074">And you can't help, when you meet one of the older generation, my generation, you can't help but wonder where they were in those years between deg38 and deg44, what they were doing, whether they took part in any of the atrocities that were visited on the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2075">But you hesitate to ask.</sentence><sentence id="2076">Maybe my parents weren't so afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2077">Maybe they did ask, a few times.</sentence><sentence id="2078">But I've never asked.</sentence><sentence id="2079">I've met some of the younger people and they don't really have a recollection of it, and in that case perhaps it's good for them, for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2080">One of the interesting trips that we recently took, we went a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise</span> and wound up -- up in the -- in the Baltic.</sentence><sentence id="2081">And we would up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rostock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2082">And there they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2083">Well, for the people who were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise</span>, and there were a group of Jewish people on the <span

lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2091">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2092">So, as I say, we volunteered to go along with them, and we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and we had a German guide, a young woman, very knowledgeable, who took us around and showed us the highlights in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and the tour.</sentence><sentence id="2093">And the tour a -- the centerpiece of the tour was going to see <span class="BUILDING">Checkpoint Charlie</span>, and what used to be <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, this small section that they preserved for histo -- for history.</sentence><sentence id="2094">And very little was remembered by the guide of -- or was told to any of us about World War II and what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> during that period of time, period of years.</sentence><sentence id="2095">It was interesting observation for me, because the young Germans were more -- much more affected, and understandably so, by the separ -- the -- the separation of east and the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> and the hardships that the <span class="REGION">eastern Germany</span> -- Germans experienced, and the fact that they were separated from their families and couldn't see each other, and the -- the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and the suicides that resulted from that, or people who were killed trying to escape.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And this was foremost in their minds, this was how horrible things were during those years.</sentence><sentence id="2097">They didn't look back to World War II and what happened then.</sentence><sentence id="2098">That was not part of their being, their</sentence><sentence id="2100">Interview with Alfred Schnog (r) March 10, 2001 substance, their -- their memory, and -- except for one instance, which I found highly interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2101">She told us, the guide, that she was taking us to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2102">And we got out and there was this very large square, quadrangle in the center of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2103">And we marched out to the middle of this square and mostly cobblestones and in the middle was a square.</sentence><sentence id="2104">I don't know, I would say it was the size of, oh, maybe three meters by three meters, so about -- roughly about thr -- a little more than three yards by three yards square, and glass, right in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2105">You kn -- you know, it was part of the -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, it wa -- it wasn't raised in any fashion.</sentence><sentence id="2106">And she gathered everybody around this glass square that was cut into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and she said, would you please look down and tell me what you see?</sentence><sentence id="2107">And we looked down and what we could see under the glass were empty bookcases around the square and she asked whether we knew what that was.</sentence><sentence id="2108">And of course being all Jews, many of us did know exactly what it was.</sentence><sentence id="2109">It's a representation and a memorial of the book burning, where the Nazis had burned all the books.</sentence><sentence id="2110">An -- and that that would be there in -- at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Berlin</span>, well I thought was extremely interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2111">The fact that she knew about it and that she was willing to tell us about it, even though it was not on her tour and that she wasn't expected to show us this, was very interesting for us.</sentence><sentence id="2112">Then we wound up -- which they clearly avoided because they saved it for the last part of the day, we wound up at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> there, which was burned by the Germans, probably on Kristallnacht, and -- and restored.</sentence><sentence id="2113">Now it's no longer being</sentence><sentence id="2115">Interview with Alfred Schnog m March 10, 2001 used as a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> cause it was violated as religious ground.</sentence><sentence id="2116">But we stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2117">There's a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> right next door to it where we could go in for a few minutes and see what there was, we really didn't have much time.</sentence><sentence id="2118">But there were two plaques on the outside of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> explaining what had happened and how it was restored, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="2119">And most of my fellow cruise members couldn't read German etcetera, so I wound up being the one who read the plaques for them and translated it for them, and they were quite moved by it.</sentence><sentence id="2120">And I was pleased to be able to open their eyes to this and to be able to read them.</sentence><sentence id="2121">Now I think they were, strangely enough, more affected by it than I was, because I had been through it, I had seen it.</sentence><sentence id="2122">I think it was more of a shock to most of these people this actually happened and that this is where it took place and these are the -- the memorials to it.</sentence><sentence id="2123">So I--I found that trip very enlightening and I guess more so from the point of youth that the Germans today are, just like everybody else in the world, they are obsessed with the history of today and not with the history of yesterday.</sentence></p></dialogue>

they could send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, you know, I could -- would be a wonderful opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="2180">Well, of course the United States Army doesn't think in

have been useful.</sentence><sentence id="2182">No, I was in the ordinance corps and I was going to be -- and I had that -- you know, they had all these electronic things, they could have easily put

it didn't matter how educated they were, they were basically very, very good people, very honest people.</sentence><sentence id="2209">I had a group of sergeants who I got along with extremely,

when I was -- when I signed -- when I took over the command of my company, I signed off on things I didn't know I had, or didn't know existed and -- and when it finally came time for me to turn the

said okay, would you -- h-here is our inventory, would you sign off on it please?</sentence><sentence id="2218">And we start looking around and when he checked it off and we went <span

be.</sentence><sentence id="2219">And I said hm, I guess it must have been somewhere, but -- and the fellow signed off and everything was just perfect.</sentence><sentence id="2220">And when he left I pulled out a bottle that I had there and I said, look gentlemen, the s -- the sergeants -- well, you know, I guess this is goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="2221">I want you to have a drink and -- and

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2383">A: I worked for my father and we -- I was stationed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> for awhile learning how to become a steel scrap trader.</sentence><sentence id="2384">And it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2385">I had problems dealing with New Englanders because they were so difficult to talk with, you know, they didn't open up.</sentence><sentence id="2386">I -- I think one of the things I learned there was that sometimes it's good to keep your mouth shut.</sentence><sentence id="2387">I never forget the time I had to persuade a New England scrap dealer to sell me a carload of scrap, because we were going to ship it</sentence><sentence id="2389">off to -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> com -- sailing out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2390">And he was selling all his scrap to a competitor.</sentence><sentence id="2391">And so I went in to see him -- Leroy was his name.</sentence><sentence id="2392">And I said -- I introduced myself and I told him who I worked for and I said, I'd like to buy your scrap and I gave him my sales pitch, this is what I want, this is what I'm ready to pay for it and I really would like to start and I hope you can give us a chance, and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="2393">And then I had made my pitch, I said, what do you think?</sentence><sentence id="2394">And he didn't answer.</sentence><sentence id="2395">He just sat there.</sentence><sentence id="2396">And for awhile I said to myself, well, should I say something, or shouldn't I?</sentence><sentence id="2397">And I said, you know, I've just said everything that I need to say.</sentence><sentence id="2398">If he's not going to reply to me, just keep your mouth shut, sit.</sentence><sentence id="2399">For once in your lifetime, don't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="2400">So I sat there what was an interminable amount of time and I don't know how long it was, maybe four or five minutes or so, which is ridiculous, you know, you" re sitting there and you're wondering what you're going to do, and beginning to sweat.</sentence><sentence id="2401">Should I get up and leave, what?</sentence><sentence id="2402">And he suddenly said, yup, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2403">Now, I don't know what he was thinking about, I have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="2404">And I won't ever question it.</sentence><sentence id="2405">But that was that, I said thank you and I left and I sent him the order and that was that.</sentence><sentence id="2406">So I learned a lot from that experience.</sentence><sentence id="2407">I stayed with that company, I wasn't happy there in <span class="REGION">New England</span>, and moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and met Ben Livingston, who was an elderly man, was my father's partner for some years.</sentence><sentence id="2408">And we -- and I got into the import and export business in -- in -- in steel.</sentence><sentence id="2409">It was in the new <span class="BUILDING">steel business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2410">And in 1962 he retired from the company.</sentence><sentence id="2411">And I know he</sentence><sentence id="2413">was -- he was not happy retiring, he was an active man.</sentence><sentence id="2414">He was in his 70's, but wanted to continue to work, which is very interesting because I feel exactly the same way today and I'm probably about the same age he was when he retired.</sentence><sentence id="2415">And so, with my father's help, I spoke with Ben Livingston and we put together three people and we said, let's go out in business and start the business.</sentence><sentence id="2416">And I figured that Ben Livingston had a good reputation in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2417">If he stayed active in the business for just three years, we'd have enough grounding in order to be able to -- to run the business without him.</sentence><sentence id="2418">Well, we did.</sentence><sentence id="2419">We went out, found a small <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Lincoln building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and went to work with three of us, myself, an associate of mine and Ben Livingston, the younger associate.</sentence><sentence id="2420">And we started to build the <span class="BUILDING">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2421">And in three years Ben Livingston showed no signs of retiring and he was as -- he's -- he was -- h-he lived until he was 89 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2422">He came into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> every single day.</sentence><sentence id="2423">He was no longer active in the daily trading, but he became a very close friend of mine and we were able to talk to each other and pass information back and forth f-for -- for many years.</sentence><sentence id="2424">We -- I finally took over as the president of the company and it was extremely successful, it worked out quite well.</sentence><sentence id="2425">Into -- one of the interesting incidents I'1ll never forget with Ben Livingston, he was in his 80's already and found it difficult to get around.</sentence><sentence id="2426">He was using a cane.</sentence><sentence id="2427">He was a big man, heavy, and he would start losing some of his agility.</sentence><sentence id="2428">And I was in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> talking to him, I was going to take a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, a business trip and I sat down and I told him</sentence><sentence id="2430">Interview with Alfred Schnog me March 10, 2001 what I was going to do, and how we were going to get around, we had a problem there, and discussed the problem with him and how best to solve it.</sentence><sentence id="2431">Suddenly the lights went out in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we were on the -- that time on the 21" floor of the <span class="BUILDING">Lincoln building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2432">And I said okay, let's sit around, let's see what happens.</sentence><sentence id="2433">And half an hour passed and the lights didn't come back on.</sentence><sentence id="2434">And I said, you know, something's going on.</sentence><sentence id="2435">We called up and we found out the whole <span class="REGION">east coast</span> was blacked out.</sentence><sentence id="2436">I don't know whether you remember the big blackout.</sentence><sentence id="2437">And I said Ben, I don't know whether we're going to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2438">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> aren't running, everything is closed down.</sentence><sentence id="2439">I just made a telephone call, the whole <span class="REGION">east coast</span> is blacked out.</sentence><sentence id="2440">I don't -- can't -- don't think I can leave you here.</sentence><sentence id="2441">And he said well, you know something, I -- if you'll help me I -- let's go up to my <span class="BUILDING">club</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2442">He was a memory of the Harmony Club up on <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>, which was up on <span class="DLF">60" Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2443">And I said, all right, come on, I'll help you.</sentence><sentence id="2444">And we -- poor fellow, he walked down 21 flights of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> with his cane, and we started walking uptown.</sentence><sentence id="2445">It was an extraordinary night.</sentence><sentence id="2446">You know, people didn't know what was happening, it was the height of the Cold War, people thought that the Russians were sending missiles over and bombing <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we were going to be attacked any moment, and there were all kinds of fears everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="2447">People were praying, it was just unbelievable what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2448">And we were walking up <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>, straight up <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2449">And Ben got pretty tired.</sentence><sentence id="2450">We were up near <span class="DLF">50" Street</span> and he was kind of exhausted by this time, and</sentence><sentence id="2452">Interview with Alfred Schnog *!</sentence><sentence id="2453">March 10, 2001 there was Saint Patrick's Cathedral right there next to us.</sentence><sentence id="2454">And I said Ben, you know, why don't we go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and sit down, you know, you can use a spell of rest, and I -- and he said you know Al, that's a good idea, let's go.</sentence><sentence id="2455">So we went to Saint Patrick's cathe -- <span class="BUILDING">Cathedral</span>, which was amazing.</sentence><sentence id="2456">It was lit up by candles and people, you know, they were afraid, they didn't know what was happening and they were praying and i-it was an extraordinary sight.</sentence><sentence id="2457">And we sat down, we just sat and relaxed for awhile until -- and I observed all this, the people crying, people in fear, people not knowing where they were going to go, people just resting like we were.</sentence><sentence id="2458">And finally Ben said okay, I think I'm up to going a little bit further.</sentence><sentence id="2459">And we marched from there the next 10 <span class="DLF">blocks</span> to get up to the <span class="BUILDING">Harmony Club</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2460">We walked in and he said, come on up to the second <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2461">We went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>, wherever it was and there were these huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">leather chairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2462">And we just plopped down and he said okay, now what will you drink?</sentence><sentence id="2463">And we had some scotch and really just enjoyed that evening.</sentence><sentence id="2464">And eventually I think I found my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by -- I left Ben there, I knew he was taken care of and I found my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a group of other guys in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> that night.</sentence><sentence id="2465">That's

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2552">Q: So you're still in this -- in the same business?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2554">A: Yeah, the business was -- went quite well for many, many years and in 1991 we had some very bad luck, we -- we had a -- an operation with, or a -- a joint venture with an organization, we started a company in <span class="REGION">Puerto Rico</span> with a man who would --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2557">we thought we could trust and as often these things happen, we couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="2558">The -- the trust was not -- was not well placed, and we lost an awful lot of money na -- in that particular year, so much so that we had to go out of business [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2559">And we joined -- we -- what we wound up doing was set -- discharging our employees, which I think was probably one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do, let people go, tell them that we just couldn't carry on.</sentence><sentence id="2560">And we went -- we joined a -- another organization, Stemcor at the time, whom we sold ourselves to for practically nothing because they didn't believe we could do anything.</sentence><sentence id="2561">So we said okay, we" ll make a deal with you.</sentence><sentence id="2562">Here's what we want to earn and if we don't earn it, you don't pay us anything.</sentence><sentence id="2563">So we were at risk and if we lost money we were prepared to make it up to them.</sentence><sentence id="2564">And so we went to work for them and it didn't take very long, we hit it just right and in three years we had recovered practically everything we lost on the other <span class="BUILDING">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2565">It was -- we did exceedingly well.</sentence><sentence id="2566">And it came time to renegotiate the contract and we renegotiated it and then -- for two -- for two more years.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And then they got kind of jealous by how much we were making, and you know, th-these things happen.</sentence><sentence id="2568">We got into arguments about why aren't you paying us and they wanted to create all kinds of reserves.</sentence><sentence id="2569">Well, you -- you -- we're not going to pay you now and we'll pay you later and we said no.</sentence><sentence id="2570">And after two years we closed that up.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2571">Actually, there was a lawsuit that resulted from the --

Yeah, so we -- we were working for this organization, the name was Stemcor and we had, when we joined them we did exceedingly well, we had renegotiated our contract.</sentence><sentence id="2581">And we were also involved at the time, together with Stemcor in a legal matter, which stemmed from the old business.</sentence><sentence id="2582">And I remember the president of that company, Ralph Oppenheimer came over to see me and we went to see -- talk settlement with the opposing parties, who were the banks.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And the judge demanded that we settle for, I think a million dollars was the settlement -- would be.</sentence><sentence id="2584">And I remember taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back with Oppenheimer from the -- from the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2585">And he said, Alfred, you are going to pay your share of

we're not.</sentence><sentence id="2588">We have an agreement and we're going to stick to our agreement.</sentence><sentence id="2589">We stuck to ours, now you stick to yours.</sentence><sentence id="2590">And he said well, you know, if you don't, I will not renew your contract.</sentence><sentence id="2591">And I said all right, if that's the way you feel.</sentence><sentence id="2592">So I -- I believe I said, that" ll suit me just fine.</sentence><sentence id="2593">You know, I was sick and tired of that -- running into that kind of an argument with him.</sentence><sentence id="2594">And I kind of felt I must have a lot of my mother and father in me, because they would</sentence><sentence id="2596">have done the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2597">They would have
