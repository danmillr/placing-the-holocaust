id="249">And day time we did sleep and we slept in the open.</sentence><sentence id="250">Many times we slept on the bare <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and when we woke up in the evening you know we were covered with snow.</sentence><sentence id="251">And it was very tough.</sentence><sentence id="252">It was not an easy life at all.</sentence><sentence id="253">Later on when in January, end of December and January when it became very cold, we took over how do you say, a <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> which was deep in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">And we did make a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> from there because it was close to a <span

class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">So that nobody could see whether there was any movement, the movement went through the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and we stayed in this, in this <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">And our activities were we were, you have to remember that this part of, where we were and also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> itself was incorporated into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">It was <span class="REGION">German territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">They claimed it as German.</sentence><sentence id="260">And many of the inhabitants, Polish inhabitants were evicted.</sentence><sentence id="261">And many of the <span class="DLF">farms</span> and so on and big <span class="DLF">estates</span> where the Polish owners were evicted and Germans were brought in from deferment parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> because the Germans were straight and even <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> there were German people living in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, in the <span class="REGION">Volga region</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 6 And they were brought in there.</sentence><sentence id="267">So our movements we had difficulty in movement.</sentence><sentence id="268">But we did also undertake some where we intercepted some prisoners and we, I know of, of only one instance where we intercepted two Polish prisoners while they were taken from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> or from one camp taking to the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">They were intercepted by us and taken.</sentence><sentence id="270">And they were freed.</sentence><sentence id="271">Well how it was done that they were convoyed by guards, by two guards, two prisoners and from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub camp</span> to the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the way they were approached.</sentence><sentence id="272">We had uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="273">We also had SS uniforms and we approached them and we told them.</sentence><sentence id="274">that we were representatives of the camp Gestapo, or the political department and that these two prisoners are needed for interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="275">And we signed the papers an gave to the guards and they released them and we took them over.</sentence><sentence id="276">And they came and joined the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="277">It so happened that they didn't, one of them anyway didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="278">He was later on killed in an action.</sentence><sentence id="279">Where matter of fact I had another friend of mine came the night before to this safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">And we left next night and in the morning this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was surrounded and one of the, the one prisoner who was released by us was the, there were actually four of them and they were all killed with the exception of one.</sentence><sentence id="281">Who hid in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the, of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and while the Germans tried to flush them out they were throwing grenades into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, he always picked up the grenade before it exploded and threw it in the next part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">And then he buried himself in one corner of the, of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> there was you know potatoes, when they grow and I don't' know to do, how do you describe them.</sentence><sentence id="283"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potato</span> and they have light you know they start growing.</sentence><sentence id="284">And people in order to prevent it you know they take it, take these parts off.</sentence><sentence id="285">They grow and he buried himself in there.</sentence><sentence id="286">So when the SS came they knew that there were four prisoners or partisans and they only could account for 3.</sentence><sentence id="287">And finally one of .</sentence><sentence id="291">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 7 the SS people had an idea that to look there whether somebody is buried under this, I don't' know how to call this, this outgrowth of the potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="292">And they discovered him so they took him.</sentence><sentence id="293">They bound his hands behind him.</sentence><sentence id="294">With a belt.</sentence><sentence id="295">And put him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and were driving him to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">Somehow when he was sitting there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> he loosened his hands and jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> you know and while he jumped out on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, he hit his and broke his collar bone and smashed his face.</sentence><sentence id="297">But picked himself up and he run on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">Before they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, he got away.</sentence><sentence id="299">And he survived.</sentence><sentence id="300">Matter of fact he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">And last year he died.</sentence><sentence id="302">He had a heart condition.</sentence><sentence id="303">So he was very lucky, he was very lucky.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: These were typical of your experiences then right before the -- A Now we did what did we, you see we, we caught, we couldn't and we didn't' want to kill you know unnecessarily.</sentence><sentence id="376">We had opportunities to you know kill the Germans but the repercussions would be so, so great that it you know that only the unarmed civilian population would be suffering.</sentence><sentence id="377">We didn't want that.</sentence><sentence id="378">But what we did since some of the big <span class="DLF">farms</span> were taken over by the Germans who were brought out from different parts of Europe, we did tell them that they will have to move out.</sentence><sentence id="379">We were harassing them.</sentence><sentence id="380">And we were also blowing up you know <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and <span class="DLF">railway jun</span>, there was <span class="DLF">railway junctions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">That's what we, but we were not intent to killing individuals because we knew that there would be great repercussions you know to the Polish c, civilian population.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="389">So we, we tried to avoid that.</sentence><sentence id="390">But of course I was only 4 months in the partisans since my escape.</sentence><sentence id="391">And we also of course we had to feed ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="392">What we you know we, we raided .</sentence><sentence id="396">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 8 some of the <span class="BUILDING">German stores</span> you know for the food which we needed.</sentence><sentence id="397">We also took cattle from the <span class="DLF">German farms</span> and so on because we needed to feed ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="398">But the life in the partisans was very, very hard.</sentence><sentence id="399">Very, very tough indeed.</sentence><sentence id="400">And many times we also went hungry.</sentence><sentence id="401">If we had to if we couldn't get any food from the Germans, you know of course we did buy food from the Polish peasants but we paid for it cause we had funds for this.</sentence><sentence id="402">And we didn't want to anybody to suffer.</sentence><sentence id="403">Now there were, we did have well I can tell you one instance where we did matter of fact, I and three other.</sentence><sentence id="404">I was in charge of this action.</sentence><sentence id="405">We went, we were always very close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="406">Quite close.</sentence><sentence id="407">We you know we and one day actually one night we went and we, we had to do something and then on the way back we were rather tired.</sentence><sentence id="408">It was late at night and I said let's knock on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and let's hope that these are Polish peasants.</sentence><sentence id="409">As it happened, he was a Polish peasant and did knock on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and he came and we told him who we are and whether he could give us a lift.</sentence><sentence id="410">Through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="411">It was quite a distance to walk.</sentence><sentence id="412">And he said oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="413">He will and he right away he got dressed and he went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> and he you know harnessed a horse and to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414">And we told him to avoid the main <span class="DLF">roads</span>, to go you know through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and so on but avoid the, the main <span class="DLF">roads</span> because on the main <span class="DLF">roads</span> there were German transports going and so on.</sentence><sentence id="415">We didn't want to have any encounter with them.</sentence><sentence id="416">So as we came to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and it was of course snow covered, the terrain and it was rather dark night.</sentence><sentence id="417">But still the reflection from the snow you know it was making it.</sentence><sentence id="418">Anyway we came to the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="419">As we were in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, we looked to the sides and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> parked in the, in the <span class="DLF">yards</span> of the, of the <span class="BUILDING">peasant huts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="420">And it was an SS unit and we didn't of course.</sentence><sentence id="421">I had to make .</sentence><sentence id="425">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 9 the decision and I said well since we are more than half way through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> we just carry on.</sentence><sentence id="426">And we did carry on.</sentence><sentence id="427">Then the <span class="DLF">village road</span> left to the main <span class="DLF">road</span> which we had to take.</sentence><sentence id="428">As we came to the main <span class="DLF">road</span> a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> came out and the <span class="DLF">road</span> was very narrow and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped and a sergeant, SS sergeant got out and apparently he had the intention of arresting us and that we are trying to interfere with his war.</sentence><sentence id="429">And but when he saw us four there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span>, it was the driver, there were five, he didn't' utter a word.</sentence><sentence id="430">He, he realized that we were probably he realized that we were partisans.</sentence><sentence id="431">Because on the main <span class="DLF">roads</span> the Germans had big boards, billboards.</sentence><sentence id="432">The written and warning that the German troops of bandits, they called us bandits.</sentence><sentence id="433">Bandits you know so I'm sure he realized that we were one but he didn't say.</sentence><sentence id="434">Anyway had he uttered something you know we would have to shoot him because, but so we went, we came to the main <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">The main <span class="DLF">road</span> was at that time free and then we went a little bit further to the foothills and we dismissed the, the driver.</sentence><sentence id="436">And we thanked him very much and we then walked there and we went back into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="437">We had some safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> .</sentence><sentence id="438">it was there were foresters who were at the, we stayed with

class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="566">And we came to the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">We didn't take the main <span

and out.</sentence><sentence id="569">You know they were mountain people so we didn't have to them anyway.</sentence><sentence id="570">But we came once to a main <span class="DLF">road</span> and on this main <span class="DLF">road</span> therefore was a whole battalion of Germans marching in the night.</sentence><sentence id="571">And they were withdrawing from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="572">And we came right to, to the edge of you know on the, of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we walked alongside the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="573">They didn't bother us and we didn't bother.</sentence><sentence id="574">They spoke to us and we spoke to them.</sentence><sentence id="575">And then when there was a <span

of German .</sentence><sentence id="580">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 11 solders because we didn't have any chance.</sentence><sentence id="581">And they didn't want any bother either.</sentence><sentence id="582">So you know it mutually understandable that they knew that there were partisans and knew that they were, but we didn't interfere with their actions and they didn't interfere with us.</sentence><sentence id="583">And in, in January of 45 when, when | don't' know the exact date but probably in the middle, in the middle of January because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was liberated a, | think at the end of January on the | think 28" of January.</sentence><sentence id="584">But it was evacuated on the 18" January.</sentence><sentence id="585">The able bodied prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were evacuated to deep into the German Reich and they were marched.</sentence><sentence id="586">So in the, in the middle of January when we knew that the front and the Russians are coming close, we an order came from the main <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the partisan unit.</sentence><sentence id="587">Actually the partisan units were called the home army.</sentence><sentence id="588">In, and it was a very well

of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you know.</sentence><sentence id="589">And what awe heard when they came and they disclosed themselves to the Russians many of them or most of them were arrested and taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="590">And since we knew about it, we said we are not going to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> knew about it, they disbanded.</sentence><sentence id="591">They gave us orders to be that we will be disbanding and go as civilians and they issued us false papers as civilians.</sentence><sentence id="592">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="593">So we went after the Russians moved there we went as civilians and we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="594">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I had other friends of mine who came escaped from <span

was very, very poor and we couldn't' move very easily but eventually we were able to, to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="602">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 12 And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> we had some friends, especially one friend who was still alive.</sentence><sentence id="603">He was also a former inmate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we stayed with him.</sentence><sentence id="604">And later on when the movement, you know at that time there was, the whole front was moving west.</sentence><sentence id="605">And we encountered many, many Russians and especially the Russians who near, when we stayed near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they were always asking us how far is it to the former <span class="DLF">Polish German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="606">And we said it was approximately it was ten kilometers and we said we were curious.</sentence><sentence id="607">Why did they ask.</sentence><sentence id="608">I said why do you ask.</sentence><sentence id="609">He

friend who also lived in, in northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, we wanted to go and we went.</sentence><sentence id="718">And for instance we had to travel mostly on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the, of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="719">Then we only could get, we couldn't go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="720">We had to take some <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="721">Then and we had to walk, to walk many times you know for, for many hundred, not hundred but tens of kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="722">And finally we did get to, to nearby west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and there we got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian transport train</span> which was delivering petrol or what you say, gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="723">You know to the front cause the war was still on.</sentence><sentence id="724">So we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanker</span> and I, I had an accident.</sentence><sentence id="725">I put my foot in order you know to sit under the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> you know and just on some <span class="DLF">railing</span> you know.</sentence><sentence id="726">I tried to prop myself up and I put my foot in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coupling</span> you know where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when they, the coupling.</sentence><sentence id="727">There was an <span class="DLF">opening</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">I put my, my heel into it.</sentence><sentence id="729">I wore, I had a German jackboot you know which I took from a German.</sentence><sentence id="730">And it had a very strong heel.</sentence><sentence id="731">Anyway I put it in there.</sentence><sentence id="732">And while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was pulling you know there was a <span class="DLF">gap</span> and I didn't' realize that after it started braking it stand you know and the <span class="DLF">opening</span> closed and it caught my heel.</sentence><sentence id="733">And matter of fact, I thought that I lost my you know my, my heel.</sentence><sentence id="734">That it was crushed.</sentence><sentence id="735">Because right away you see the, the boot.</sentence><sentence id="736">Broke, the leather broke.</sentence><sentence id="737">And I felt tremendous heat you know in the whole foot.</sentence><sentence id="738">But I couldn't' pull out, I couldn't' do anything until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to pull again and then I was able to feel my foot.</sentence><sentence id="739">And, but and I asked my friend because my friend was sitting next to me, to hold me in case I lost consciousness.</sentence><sentence id="740">You know so that I wouldn't' fall under the wheels.</sentence><sentence id="741">And, and then finally the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came to a stop at a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and we got off and I went to a first aid station but they .</sentence><sentence id="745">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Leonard Zawacki 14</span> didn't' have much there.</sentence><sentence id="746">in the first aid station.</sentence><sentence id="747">They couldn't' do it.</sentence><sentence id="748">all they did, they split the jack boot and I took it off and there was, there was no, it was only internal bleeding and the whole foot was black and blue.</sentence><sentence id="749">And they, they couldn't x ray because they didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">x ray machines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">And we couldn't also we had to walk for an hour I think, some 30 or 40 kilometers to the next, and I was hobbling on this foot and eventually there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, a peasant's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and I, they put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">peasant's cart</span> and that, til we came to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> which was is approximately 40 miles away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="751">And I stayed there for the next two weeks I think, three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="752">And then later on, I, I took from there and I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to, to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> which I thought I would be able to get.</sentence><sentence id="753">But it only went one <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and they stopped.</sentence><sentence id="754">The Russians stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they put it on the side, side rank.</sentence><sentence id="755">And then they took all the people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to do, do some work for the you know for the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="756">I, I refused.</sentence><sentence id="757">I said I can't work because I, I was lame.</sentence><sentence id="758">I just couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="759">So I had an argument with a Russian sergeant, but anyway he walked away.</sentence><sentence id="760">And, and then he said well you work for one day and then the next day you will go carry on.</sentence><sentence id="761">Well the next day came.</sentence><sentence id="762">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was still on the sides.</sentence><sentence id="763">You know the people were still working.</sentence><sentence id="764">The next, there was only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> a day coming.</sentence><sentence id="765">But I knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="766">you know I knew how the Russians behaved so I went back and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came I got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I went, but again it only went few, a few <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> and then I had to get off and walk.</sentence><sentence id="767">And by that time I could walk much better.</sentence><sentence id="768">And then I while I walked, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian truck</span> came and I stopped and they, they gave me a lift.</sentence><sentence id="769">And then finally I came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was quite close to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="770">But it was on the left bank of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula river</span> and I had to walk, I walked to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> but the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> on my, there were two <span class="DLF">bridges</span> leading across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> and they were both .</sentence><sentence id="774">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 15 blown up.</sentence><sentence id="775">So and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> was full of ice.</sentence><sentence id="776">It was still I think March.</sentence><sentence id="777">Full of ice.</sentence><sentence id="778">So I couldn't get through and it was, the level of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> was very high.</sentence><sentence id="779">There were <span class="DLF">docks</span> you know.</sentence><sentence id="780">It was close to the you know you thought that any, any moment it will overflow.</sentence><sentence id="781">You know and flood all the low lying lands.</sentence><sentence id="782">But after a few days you know it, water receded and the ice receded and then the Russian start to build a <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="783">So once they started building the <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span>, I, I stayed in a, a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">German farm house</span> which was abandoned by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="784">And there were, but there were still you know the livestock was there and we went into this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="785">There was nobody but we went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was heat so we wondered what, what happening.</sentence><sentence id="786">Couldn't see.</sentence><sentence id="787">After a while a man came and he was a groom who was a Polish fellow, a groom to the livestock who were German farmer.</sentence><sentence id="788">And we said well then we can stay.</sentence><sentence id="789">He said oh yes you can stay here.</sentence><sentence id="790">He said do you need any food.</sentence><sentence id="791">I said of course we need food.</sentence><sentence id="792">So he brought us food and milk.</sentence><sentence id="793">And so we stayed there for a few days until the water had receded.</sentence><sentence id="794">Once the water receded we went to the, to the place where the Russians were building the <span class="DLF">pontoon bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="795">As we came there, the Russianist arrested us and took us, they said, not arrested but they wanted us to work so they loaded us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they were driving somewhere and said where are you driving.</sentence><sentence id="796">Finally you know because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped and the officer got out and he looked at the map and he didn't know where he was.</sentence><sentence id="797">And then we asked him what do you want.</sentence><sentence id="798">He said I want the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="799">I said why.</sentence><sentence id="800">Because we need some wood to cut wood.</sentence><sentence id="801">I said why didn't you ask us.</sentence><sentence id="802">We would, you're going out of your way.</sentence><sentence id="803">Going the wrong direction.</sentence><sentence id="804">You should have asked us, you know.</sentence><sentence id="805">We would have told you where to how to take.</sentence><sentence id="806">So we had to go back and then we came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">And there .</sentence><sentence id="811">Interview with <span class="BUILDING">Leonard Zawacki 16</span> they got off you know and looked which <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> to cut.</sentence><sentence id="812">In the meantime we all dispersed you know.</sentence><sentence id="813">And we, I went back, I went back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were building the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pontoon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="814">I got my belongings because I had to leave it there.</sentence><sentence id="815">Took my belongings, went there and then officer, captain Russian captain came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor boat</span> and I spoke to him whether he will take me across.</sentence><sentence id="816">And he said do you have vodka.</sentence><sentence id="817">I said no I don't have any vodka but I had a fountain pen and a pencil and a Parker fountain pen and a pencil in a red case and I said I give you this.</sentence><sentence id="818">He said ok.</sentence><sentence id="819">And then I said I had a friend and I said I have my brother.</sentence><sentence id="820">Of course he was not my brother.</sentence><sentence id="821">But I said I wanted him, take my brother as well.</sentence><sentence id="822">He said no, either you or nobody.</sentence><sentence id="823">It's only you I take.</sentence><sentence id="824">I won't take your brother.</sentence><sentence id="825">So I said ok.</sentence><sentence id="826">He said I have to go back to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and then I come back and I take him.</sentence><sentence id="827">And in the meantime another officer came to the <span class="DLF">water edge</span> and I started talking with him and apparently he was from I don't know whether he was from NK VD, you know the KGB or something.</sentence><sentence id="828">Anyway, he was from an intelligence unit and he had to report somewhere on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where there were the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">To the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the Russian army.</sentence><sentence id="830">And he asked me whether I knew how to get there.</sentence><sentence id="831">I said yes, I know.</sentence><sentence id="832">And we started talking and I said you go with me and I show you exactly where to go, which <span class="DLF">road</span> to take.</sentence><sentence id="833">So when the, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> came you know with the captain, he took, took us you know the Russian officer, he was I think a leftenant and myself and he drove us.</sentence><sentence id="834">But he was very leery.</sentence><sentence id="835">He didn't talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="836">The captain didn't talk to me because he was afraid.</sentence><sentence id="837">And I didn't know how he recognized but apparently he recognized that he was you know somebody very important.</sentence><sentence id="838">Not to mess.</sentence><sentence id="839">So anyway, I said well I won't give him now the pen.</sentence><sentence id="840">I said if I give him, I give him one piece, I give him the pencil.</sentence><sentence id="841">You know.</sentence><sentence id="842">So when we went out, he was standing like this with his hands you know behind him and as I walked out, I .</sentence><sentence id="846">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 17 pressed you know the pencil into his hand and he didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="847">You know because he was afraid of the, so we went and we walked.</sentence><sentence id="848">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> was it was a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="849">And the Germans were defending it until I think the end of March.</sentence><sentence id="850">So when we came just they just capitulated a day or so before.</sentence><sentence id="851">So the many parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were still burning you know.</sentence><sentence id="852">And there was a terrible destruction.</sentence><sentence id="853">Anyway we walked.</sentence><sentence id="854">I told him which way to, to take to the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> which he wanted to go and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="855">And I came to my <span class="BUILDING">parents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="856">My parents were in the <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2619">Q: Just the reasons why did this happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2621">A And now the reasons were first of all you know the, the anti, anti-Semitism you know existed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2622">And of course it was how do you say.</sentence><sentence id="2623">It was can't find the proper word.</sentence><sentence id="2624">It was intensified by the regime, of the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="2625">You know their policy was the extermination of Jews and it was not only the, it was the policy of Hitler and, and, and since the ground you know the anti, anti-Semitism was there anyway, it you know when, when they came with the propaganda you know against the Jews it fell on very fertile ground.</sentence><sentence id="2626">And that was the reason why you know the.</sentence><sentence id="2627">Now why there was anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="2628">Anti-Semitism was because most of the Jews were quite prosperous.</sentence><sentence id="2629">I, I am talking about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2630">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you know we had many, many, very many poor Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2631">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> most of them were quite prosperous and there was hate and jealousy and this all contributed you know to, to this problem of, of the, the Jewish problem.</sentence><sentence id="2632">And .</sentence><sentence id="2636">Interview with Leonard Zawacki 42 the Jewish problem was also in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2637">We first of all <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was a rather poor country.</sentence><sentence id="2638">And, and you know we had a minority, a Jewish minority of approximately 10, ten percent, close to ten percent.</sentence><sentence id="2639">And then and we also had in prewar <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we had a minority of Ukrainian minority of 15%.</sentence><sentence id="2640">So and I think the Ukrainians are even more hateful you know more anti-Semitic than, than the Poles were.</sentence><sentence id="2641">But, but, but you know the Poles were not to the extent.</sentence><sentence id="2642">They always say there were Polish pogroms.</sentence><sentence id="2643">There were no Polish pogroms because the pogroms which were existed you know were during the Russian occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2644">Anda pogrom has to be sanctioned by the government.</sentence><sentence id="2645">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> during the, the existence you know after the First World War, the, between the two world wars you know which <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was in existence for 20 years.</sentence><sentence id="2646">It never was any, anything, any pogroms sanctioned by the Polish government.</sentence><sentence id="2647">But the pogroms were sanctioned in you know as we know in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and we know what happened you know to the Jews you know during the last war.</sentence><sentence id="2648">We know that 6 million of them were, perished.</sentence></p></dialogue>
