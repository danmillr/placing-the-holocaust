states which <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> occupied after 1939 and they were given the choice of <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> as we lived in the nice section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where one of the parents were to go.</sentence><sentence id="6">Two German officials came and told us we had one hour and we could take whatever we could carry plus F (couldn't hear) to go, so we went.</sentence><sentence id="7">We were able to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in one of the two or three <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> which had

1942.</sentence><sentence id="14">In 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">runcoston</span> had a assembly.</sentence><sentence id="15">It's 92, 50 years before and I still remember.</sentence><sentence id="16">He said to us, he stand before us as broken man, that he devoted all of his later years to helping orphans, he organized <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> even un <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he tried to give him as much resources to survive as he could and yet he was ordered by the Germans that he was to deliver 24,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="17">Jews over 60 years old and children under 10.</sentence><sentence id="18">He told us, you have a choice.</sentence><sentence id="19">Our police would take them and it would be dark in semi-orderly fashion or the Germans would come and take them and it would be much worse.</sentence><sentence id="20">If we want to survive, the 100,000 Jews which at the point were locked up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> want to survive, they have to give up 20,000.</sentence><sentence id="21">Well, the chorus arise, no, no, we all go.</sentence><sentence id="22">And if the reaction was the people concerned to this, it was emphatically, no.</sentence><sentence id="23">Yet, they declare curfew and nobody was allowed out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and the Jewish police went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there were some doctors among them and they make the selections.</sentence><sentence id="24">All the sickly people and the older people and the children were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="25">But what the Jewish police did was not good enough for Germans and they came.</sentence><sentence id="26">Some people were shot.</sentence><sentence id="27">They tore the children from the mothers" arms.</sentence><sentence id="28">They beat the people.</sentence><sentence id="29">The mothers who resisted were shot on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="30">In most cases, the women remained frozen when the Germans took the children away.</sentence><sentence id="31">Only when the child was already on the horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, they realize what happen, they start to chase and cry.</sentence><sentence id="32">Well, they took the 20,000, 25,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="33">And from then on, almost every able -bodied man or woman or teenager or this, had to work.</sentence><sentence id="34">The food supply didn't improve -- deteriorate, more and more.</sentence><sentence id="35">There was a lot of mismanagement, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence

spoiled.</sentence><sentence id="38">In 1942, I think, 1943, the Germans appointed Gertler, who was one of the collaborators in trying to extract as much valuables and this from the Jews, from the Germans, he appointed him head of the so called sondokommando.</sentence><sentence id="39">He tried to bring some order to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">In a way he did.</sentence><sentence id="41">He made the thing look a little more efficient.</sentence><sentence id="42">In the meanwhile, more and more, the demand for more were given and people were left in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">3,000, 5,000, 10,000 and when you walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 1943, 1944 you saw, they used to call mussermench, because the people pattern of working and bending looked like a praying Muslim.</sentence><sentence id="44">The people became living skeleton, some of them were swollen, some of them looked like skeletons and you could see a good part of the population was so emaciated that the war is not going to end soon,
