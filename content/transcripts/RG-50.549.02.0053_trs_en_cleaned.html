<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: I was liberated in a <span class="BUILDING">silo</span> after the last march called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chinno</span>, that a lot of ki -- little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span> were concentrated.</sentence><sentence id="23">And the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typhuses</span> broke out.</sentence><sentence id="24">And to tell you the honest truth, I don't remember when I was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="25">I thought they were burning down the <span class="BUILDING">silo</span>, so I covered myself with straw, but there were people were left, the dead around me, and I woke up in a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span>, with the Russian's doctor taking care of</sentence><sentence id="27"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0053 3 me.</sentence><sentence id="28">I had the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typhuses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">And then they shaved my head again, and they put a salve on it, and I looked like musselwoman.</sentence><sentence id="30">And I could hardly walk, or talk, or recognize anything.</sentence><sentence id="31">And after three days, or a week, I don't know exactly, they told us we have to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, because the front is coming on.</sentence><sentence id="32">So we should walk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span> is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polmarin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">And it was not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chinno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And as we were walking, I with a little friend of mine holding a hand, we saw two Russian soldiers, and I -- that I will never forget, and a two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> -- two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> -- officers, and we asked them to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span>, and you know we covered our head with -- with scarves, and we -- they shouldn't notice that we have typhus.</sentence><sentence id="36">And they said, "No, we cannot do it, because we are not allowed to."</sentence><sentence id="37">But they felt so sorry for the two youngsters, that they put us behind, in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span>, but they said, "The first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span>, you have to get out."</sentence><sentence id="38">So, as we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span>, the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, they said in -- in Russian, out.</sentence><sentence id="39">So, we went out, and the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we walked in.</sentence><sentence id="40">And all I can remember is everything was empty, except there was a big, big rug, maybe a Persian rug, I don't know, at that time I didn't know from Persian rug, or China rug, or anything else.</sentence><sentence id="41">And in the middle was standing a bottle, with blueberries.</sentence><sentence id="42">And I didn't know it was preserve, or something.</sentence><sentence id="43">There was no water in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="44">And we were still sick, I and that little girl, we had a temperature little bit, and we were -- we were really out.</sentence><sentence id="45">And sh -- she said, "Shall we drink it?"</sentence><sentence id="46">I said, "I am afraid it may be poisoned."</sentence><sentence id="47">Left poison, there's that bottle standing there, there's no water, there's nothing.</sentence><sentence id="48">And then we couldn't stand it any more, and what happened is is we drank, and we ate those blueberries.</sentence><sentence id="49">And at that time I was so</sentence><sentence id="51"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0053 4 young, I didn't know nothing.</sentence><sentence id="52">Later on I realized that we got up the next morning, and we felt so much better, that it was fermemented.</sentence><sentence id="53">It was set up for wine, or something, and it helped the temperature.</sentence><sentence id="54">And our temperature dropped.</sentence><sentence id="55">We s -- we went around, and we looked around like scavengers for food, and we found some food, and then I recognized some people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and they was already looking -- you know, after two weeks, three weeks, they're grown up people.</sentence><sentence id="56">And they saw me, it was like a lifesaver for them, because the Russians are going on the front to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span>, and they were raping the women.</sentence><sentence id="57">German, Jewish, it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="58">They were getting drunk and raping them.</sentence><sentence id="59">So what they did is they -- they dragged me and that little girl into their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where they lived, six women.</sentence><sentence id="60">And if you put a sign up that it's typhus, the Russians didn't care, they just tore it down and they came in, and they made hia -- chaos.</sentence><sentence id="61">And what happened is -- is that whenever a Russian came in, they took my scarf off my head, and they gave me a bottle with medicine, and they send me out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span>, and turn on the light, and the Russians, as drunk as they were, they start running, because they know there was typhus in that -- I was over already, but still looked like a musselwoman, you know, sick with the salve on my head.</sentence><sentence id="62">They start running.</sentence><sentence id="63">And this is how I saved six women from being raped by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="64">Then my hair start growing in a little bit, and I was going down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>, and there was a little <span class="DLF">pond</span> near that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and there wasn't that much water, and anything, and I thought I'1l wash out my -- whatever I have, in that <span class="DLF">pond</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">And all of a sudden I looked up, and there were two big, black boots in front of me, and I looked up, and he said to me, in Russian -- at that time I was still speaking Russian.</sentence><sentence id="68"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0053 5 He said, "Ateeja dofka."</sentence><sentence id="69">I mean, am -- am I

scared."</sentence><sentence id="72">So I took him up into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where the girls were.</sentence><sentence id="73">They saw us [indecipherable] they got so scared, they said, "Are you out of your mind?"</sentence><sentence id="74">You know, they dragged me back in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">And it so happened that it -- he was there for two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="76">He fall in love with me, he wanted to marry me.</sentence><sentence id="77">He gave me even a wedding band.</sentence><sentence id="78">And I wasn't even 15 years old yet.</sentence><sentence id="79">But nobody knew that.</sentence><sentence id="80">And he says to me he is going on the front, and he is going to write to his father, and his father will la -- his father is a doctor in the army, a big officer, and arrange to pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="81">And I thought to myself, "Let him talk."</sentence><sentence id="82">But -- but the mo -- wonderful thing was about it, for all two weeks he slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">front room</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, so nobody could get in.</sentence><sentence id="83">And when he left, we went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, to help the Russian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="84">So we slept there, so nobody could touch us there either.</sentence><sentence id="85">And one day a man came up to me, and he said, "Akeem Marouskas Supporzhnikova?"</sentence><sentence id="86">Am I Marsha Supporzhniko -- Marouska -- ma -- Marioshka Supporzhnikov.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I said yes. "</sentence><sentence id="88">My son wrote a letter at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you are here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomborg</span>, and I was looking for you, and here I find you in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">I would like to send you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.466667" long="30.733333">Odessa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">He wants to marry you."</sentence><sentence id="91">And I told him, I said, "I cannot do it.</sentence><sentence id="92">I have to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="93">I have to see where my -- if I have any family left, I have anything," I said.</sentence><sentence id="94">He said, "Do you love my son?"</sentence><sentence id="95">I said, "I don't know him well enough.</sentence><sentence id="96">I don't know what love is."</sentence><sentence id="97">I's -- I -- he didn't know my age, he didn't know nothing.</sentence><sentence id="98">Nobody know nothing about anybody.</sentence><sentence id="99">And, you know, I was still scared to tell my age, because my two little sisters were killed because they were under 15.</sentence><sentence id="100">And I -- so even</sentence><sentence id="102"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0053 6 after I was liberated, I was afraid to tell my age.</sentence><sentence id="103">So, even to that man that was the fa -- and I asked him, I said -- this may not be interested on the tape, but I asked him, I said, "Tell me, why are you, a officer in a different battalion, from a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> than your son is, and you're not even Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="104">Everybody says Marshall Zou, or whatever his name was, I don't even remember, and he says, "You see, they took us, the Jewish officers, and doctors, and send us to different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, because when we were caught from the Germans, that the soldiers, the Russian soldiers shouldn't give us out that we are Jews on top of it."</sentence><sentence id="105">So this is my first lesson I learned, that I wasn't the only one that suffered, and there were other people as young as I was, at -- it concentrated, that answer concentrated into my mind.</sentence><sentence id="106">And we felt better, and we didn't know there was [indecipherable] existed.</sentence><sentence id="107">We didn't know about people not going back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or nothing.</sentence><sentence id="108">All I want is to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and see what's happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
