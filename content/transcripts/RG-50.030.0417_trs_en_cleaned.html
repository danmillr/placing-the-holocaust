<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: And who did you say this to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: I said it both to my parents and to some friends, because I could not understand the restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="265">I could not understand what I had done to deserve the punishment of being beaten up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or having stones thrown at me or obscene names.</sentence><sentence id="266">I did not -- I did not realize the impact, and I believed at that point, that it would change.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Yes because it was very secure.</sentence><sentence id="351">It was very predictable, and it gave us a sense of belonging.</sentence><sentence id="352">It gave us a sense of being cared for.</sentence><sentence id="353">It gave us a sense of never missing anything.</sentence><sentence id="354">Anything that was necessary for a normal life or a satisfactory life was provided.</sentence><sentence id="355">You didn't have to ask for it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: Were you happy when Karin was born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: Yes, I was delighted.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Did that mean that you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, even though she was so much younger, to laugh and be liked?</sentence><sentence id="367">I mean, did it give you something that you hadn't had?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Well, I wanted a sister, and I put a cube of sugar on the <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> so the stork would come and take the sugar and bring a sister.</sentence><sentence id="371">Yes, we played, even though there was a five-year difference.</sentence><sentence id="372">She was very fast, very bright, and very pretty, and when she started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I had to listen, "Why can't you behave like your sister?</sentence><sentence id="373">Why can't you be as intelligent as your sister?</sentence><sentence id="374">Why do you have to talk out of turn?</sentence><sentence id="375">Why can't you bring <span class="BUILDING">home</span> A's like your sister?"</sentence><sentence id="376">And that was a little difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: Maybe not in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, but definitely at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">At <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I got into trouble here and there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How so?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="392">A: I would talk out of turn and we organized some pranks for teacher.</sentence><sentence id="393">I could think of putting thumb tacks some <span class="NPIP">place</span>, or put some glue on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="394">Or, when it's later on, when the physics professor said, "Turn the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bunsen burner</span> on low," I turned it on high, and all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> blew out, and my dad had to pay for new <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="395">So, I had my share of troubles.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="419">Q: Wait one second.</sentence><sentence id="420">The noise is really too much.</sentence><sentence id="421">Okay, I'm sorry, go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="425">A: The precinct police wore green uniforms and those silly helmets, but they were separate.</sentence><sentence id="426">Each <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span> had a -- each <span class="INT_SPACE">living area</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span> and it was mandatory that when you moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that you register at the <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span> -- name, address, occupation, tax id number, and religion.</sentence><sentence id="427">When you decided to move from <span class="DLF">A Street</span> to <span class="DLF">B Street</span>, you went back to the <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">You told them where you're moving to.</sentence><sentence id="429">You went to the new <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span>, and you went through the procedure again.</sentence><sentence id="430">This system still exists in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and this was probably one of the reasons that you could keep tabs on people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: But you clearly experienced a difference in terms of when you said that you felt, on the one hand, you're invisible, on the other hand, people know you're Jewish, and you're receiving all sorts of punishment of one sort or another.</sentence><sentence id="438">So, you're both invisible and not invisible at the same time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="441">A: Well, I was visible, but the adults wanted me to be invisible, not to draw any attention.</sentence><sentence id="442">While, on the other hand, we took the punishment regardless of where we stood, where we walked or what we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: So, it was really bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: It got progressively worse.</sentence><sentence id="460">At first it was taunts and remarks, and then it became physical.</sentence><sentence id="461">But they tried to comfort us, but I think, as children, or as growing children, we were afraid and became subsequently more so.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="477">A: I stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> more, or somebody had to bring me to a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="478">I started to draw and paint a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="479">My grades slipped terribly, and that's when most of my spare time was occupied with tutors.</sentence><sentence id="480">The grades improved, but I don't think the happiness changed or the unhappiness changed.</sentence><sentence id="481">I would have like to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like many of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, but my parents saw no reason to leave because, in their eyes, we were former nationals.</sentence><sentence id="482">We had the protection of another government and we were untouchable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="489">Q: Did they say this to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2926">A: Right, because money was very little and worthless.</sentence><sentence id="2927">So, she tried for a while in the felt shoe factory and in the <span class="BUILDING">hat factory</span>, but they wouldn't hire her.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2934">A: If we had enough material to hit the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> because sometimes you got items that weren't even combinable or cookable, but we would try in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="2935">And if you shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and you had a corner for your food supplies or a shelf, it very often happened that by evening something had disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="2936">Somebody in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was so hungry, they couldn't resist.</sentence><sentence id="2937">That was very, very common.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2942">Q: So, how quickly did you feel that you were starving?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3572">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3574">A: The essence of the speech was that the Germans had demanded 20,000 sick, elderly, and children, most of them children to be sent out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3575">And the wording of the speech was, and that I think is a matter of record, "Mothers and fathers, give me your children so that the rest of us may live and survive."</sentence><sentence id="3576">There were outcries, maybe a stone or two were thrown, but police was present.</sentence><sentence id="3577">He tried to explain that he tried to negotiate that they wouldn't take children over 11 years of age, but they would have to take the sick.</sentence><sentence id="3578">He got the number decreased by a thousand and various other justifications.</sentence><sentence id="3579">Those who heard the speech and those who found about it were appalled.</sentence><sentence id="3580">It was -- the concept was unthinkable.</sentence><sentence id="3581">During the process, that the deportation was announced by Rumkowski, and by the time he had the lists on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the people written up, the Germans got angry and impatient.</sentence><sentence id="3582">They enforced a curfew of seven days starting in September, I believe it was the 7.</sentence><sentence id="3583">We were not supposed to be out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> for seven days and seven nights.</sentence><sentence id="3584">The Germans came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, with dogs and with guns.</sentence><sentence id="3585">They went from <span class="DLF">street</span> to <span class="DLF">street</span> and from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and the square area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not very large.</sentence><sentence id="3586">And it went <span class="BUILDING">house</span> by <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3587">They came to our <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3588">We had a neighbor sit on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and look out.</sentence><sentence id="3589">And when they entered the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, they shouted for everybody to assemble in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3590">And then they went into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and found those who had hidden.</sentence><sentence id="3591">They beat them and put them on</sentence><sentence id="3593">4 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3594">And then the looked at the remainder of those standing in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, probably 60 people, and within five minutes, they separated the old and the young from the more fit human beings.</sentence><sentence id="3595">My sister, although she was 11 years old, not 10, was taken.</sentence><sentence id="3596">I tried to go onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with her.</sentence><sentence id="3597">The guns stopped me.</sentence><sentence id="3598">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> drove off.</sentence><sentence id="3599">My neighbor's mother was taken -- many people out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3600">He was a policeman.</sentence><sentence id="3601">He couldn't get his mother released.</sentence><sentence id="3602">We never found out where they were taken, what was done with them, where they supposedly were resettled, in what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> they might have been sent.</sentence><sentence id="3603">But eventually, a few packages of clothing came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3604">And supposedly -- I did not see it -- some of the clothing was blood-stained.</sentence><sentence id="3605">Actual notes or actual letters I don't believe were found.</sentence><sentence id="3606">Nobody could give us an answer.</sentence><sentence id="3607">We hoped that they were alive -- someplace, somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="3608">And the curfew was lifted after seven days, and life continued for the rest of us.</sentence><sentence id="3609">It was almost as if we had been hypnotized, as if we just -- we just went on.</sentence><sentence id="3610">We went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3611">We collected the soup.</sentence><sentence id="3612">We collected the food ration.</sentence><sentence id="3613">It continued.</sentence><sentence id="3614">We had been robbed not of our children, but of our feelings, of our compassion.</sentence><sentence id="3615">Some children were hidden, but very few.</sentence><sentence id="3616">How he could have asked to hand over the children, I did not understand at 16.</sentence><sentence id="3617">I don't understand it now.</sentence><sentence id="3618">Did he have a choice?</sentence><sentence id="3619">I would say so.</sentence><sentence id="3620"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czerniakow</span> had a choice.</sentence><sentence id="3621">I mean, his life was not so precious that he could not have said no.</sentence><sentence id="3622">He could have refused to obey the orders.</sentence><sentence id="3623">He would have paid the price, but to ask this of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> is unthinkable.</sentence><sentence id="3624">I was fired from the <span class="BUILDING">dress factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3625">I don't know for what reason, probably incompetence.</sentence><sentence id="3626">I did not sew very well.</sentence><sentence id="3627">And I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on Rybna, 8 because I knew a woman there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3628">And by then it was October, and it was cold, and we stood around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and I said, "TI need a job desperately."</sentence><sentence id="3629">And her boss, who sat a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> in the corner, came over.</sentence><sentence id="3630">He started talking to me, and by then I spoke Polish and Yiddish, and he said, "I'll give you a job."</sentence><sentence id="3633">5 said, "Doing what?"</sentence><sentence id="3634">And he said, "We have received truckloads of forms to be completed for the Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for their coal rations.</sentence><sentence id="3635">And the forms have to be figured and completed.</sentence><sentence id="3636">And you'll sit in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3637">I need 300 people.</sentence><sentence id="3638">You write down the names.</sentence><sentence id="3639">People will tell you they"!l work here.</sentence><sentence id="3640">You just get their addresses, and you just do it."</sentence><sentence id="3641">I said, "Okay, I'll do it.</sentence><sentence id="3642">A job is a job."</sentence><sentence id="3643">His boss was Henryk Neftalin, the attorney, who was in his late 30s.</sentence><sentence id="3644">A very fair man.</sentence><sentence id="3645">A very able man.</sentence><sentence id="3646">I had met his mother when I was running around with those passports a year earlier.</sentence><sentence id="3647">And he was much admired.</sentence><sentence id="3648">The strange thing was that he had Rumkowski's ear.</sentence><sentence id="3649">When he would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumkowski</span>, he might take some abuse, but in the end, he would argue.</sentence><sentence id="3650">And half the time, Rumkowski would listen.</sentence><sentence id="3651">So, he was much admired.</sentence><sentence id="3652">His girlfriend worked in one of the <span class="BUILDING">administrative offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3653">Her name was Klatalka (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3654">And I worked in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, I would say, until "43, end of 43.</sentence><sentence id="3655">And one day Bernard Fuchs decided --he was the head of the Department of Labor -- that too many people worked in that <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and he needed people in the <span class="BUILDING">straw shoe factory</span> for the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3656">And the commission of several dignitaries came, among them Rumkowski.</sentence><sentence id="3657">And it was again a selection of who goes and who stays.</sentence><sentence id="3658">And I hid pretty much to the bitter end until I was called, because they had my name on the list.</sentence><sentence id="3659">And Rumkowski sat on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3660">He had taken off his hat and his coat, and he had his cane in his right hand.</sentence><sentence id="3661">And for a minute, he reminded me of a fairy tale -- a king sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">throne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3662">He spoke to me in Yiddish and he asked me my name, whether I had family, where I had come from, and in the end he said, "Little German, you may stay, and you" ll hear from me."</sentence><sentence id="3663">He took a lot of people out of that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="3664">Bernard Fuchs threw out the list as he had drawn up previous deportation lists.</sentence><sentence id="3665">I had gone to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when I was jobless and asked him for employment because he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and he spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="3666">And after my third visit, he lost his temper, and</sentence><sentence id="3668">6 he said that he had not jobs, that I was a pest, or the equivalent in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="3669">He opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and he yelled like a German, "Raus!"</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3790">Q: She was the executive secretary to Rumkowski, so she had a very high position.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3792">A: She was more than that.</sentence><sentence id="3793">She was his ears and his mouth because Rumkowski could not speak to the Germans in any language.</sentence><sentence id="3794">She could speak.</sentence><sentence id="3795">She could speak Polish, and by then, with the same accent I had, and she could speak German.</sentence><sentence id="3796">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walchovna</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3797">I went to a whole variety of women who were in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3798">And there were many that were capable, that were intelligent, but they wouldn't hire a woman.</sentence><sentence id="3799">That was competition -- a man, yes -- a woman, no.</sentence><sentence id="3800">So, I went back to work, and a few weeks later, my boss Henryk Neftalin called me into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and he said, "I'm transferring you to the Statistical Department on Plac Koscielny, 4."</sentence><sentence id="3801">I didn't want to leave because I'd become very friendly with Spiegel and I did not like the unknown.</sentence><sentence id="3802">But you didn't argue with Henryk Neftalin.</sentence><sentence id="3803">He was fair.</sentence><sentence id="3804">He was decent.</sentence><sentence id="3805">What his reasons were, I never knew.</sentence><sentence id="3806">They could have been several.</sentence><sentence id="3807">It could have been that he wanted me out of Rumkowski's reach.</sentence><sentence id="3808">It could have been the fact that I came to work one day with a very bloody face when I had been sent to the <span class="BUILDING">Kripo</span> because somebody</sentence><sentence id="3810">7 said I had a radio, and I never did have a radio.</sentence><sentence id="3811">And he saw my bloody scars, my bloody face, my bruised eyes.</sentence><sentence id="3812">He transferred me because in essence he was the actual head of the Statistical Department.</sentence><sentence id="3813">He had the first word and the last word.</sentence><sentence id="3814">It was a long way to work over the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3815">And in winter it was hard to walk, so they unshoveled snow on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3816">You slid back rather than forward.</sentence><sentence id="3817">Hundreds of people cross the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> every morning, and you were afraid that somebody would carry lice and they would jump over on your clothing.</sentence><sentence id="3818">That was the greatest fear because they carried typhus.</sentence><sentence id="3819">The <span class="BUILDING">office</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3879">A: No, I don't think 70.</sentence><sentence id="3880">I think it was in May around 15 or 20, and then again in September, there were a lot of smaller deportations in between a thousand or 2,000.</sentence><sentence id="3881">The actual numbers I don't know, but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at any one time had roughly 160,000 people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3889">Q: You said that people went on, and what you lost in some ways was your feelings.</sentence><sentence id="3890">So, in order to go on, you clearly didn't forget Karin, but you couldn't respond to her going, I gather, in some way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3893">A: Well, I reached out for her.</sentence><sentence id="3894">I tried to go with her.</sentence><sentence id="3895">I was not allowed, but life in the overall <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> went on.</sentence><sentence id="3896">People even went so far as to use, at least for a week or two, the ration card of a person who was deported.</sentence><sentence id="3897">So, there was no -- there was no feeling.</sentence><sentence id="3898">There was no -- there was a sadness, but there was not a deep desperation and there should have been, and that, I think two or three years of ghetto life killed that within us.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4008">A: This is paperwork.</sentence><sentence id="4009">It has nothing to do with Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4010">It's like an audit at the <span class="BUILDING">Internal Revenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4011">He goes over the figures.</sentence><sentence id="4012">We got forms, let's say, from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and Mr. Smith lives in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with four other people.</sentence><sentence id="4013">He was entitled to a hundred kilo of coal, and we had to figure that out.</sentence><sentence id="4014">Four times 50 or four times 25 is 100.</sentence><sentence id="4015">Then there is Mr. Joe who has eight people living in his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4016">Each person gets 25 kilos.</sentence><sentence id="4017">So, we had to come up with the figures, and there were thousands of these forms brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">containers</span>, and we went through box after box doing the clerical work and having them shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> again to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so they could take the forms, give them to their people, and have them collect the coal.</sentence><sentence id="4018">All we did was clerical work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4030">Q: Isee.</sentence><sentence id="4031">So, this had to be a fairly quick turnaround, so people could get there...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4662">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4663">Singer spent his day mainly on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, or away from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> seeing people who had some knowledge, who had some influenced, who had important jobs.</sentence><sentence id="4664">I would pick up at the bottom of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> from Sergeant Margolis the daily statistics -- so many people died, so many people committed suicide, so many were deported.</sentence><sentence id="4665">When Singer came back into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, he would write or have us take notes and eventually, he produced a tremendous amount of material, because the chronicle of the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is not all Singer's.</sentence><sentence id="4666">I think several hundred pages at least, and that's a forthcoming book now.</sentence><sentence id="4667">He was a journalist.</sentence><sentence id="4668">He had worked as a journalist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4669">He had a tremendous insight, and normally, I was able to understand his writing except for one two-page -- I couldn't even call it a report.</sentence><sentence id="4670">It was more like a love letter to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumkowski</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4671">If you want to read the German version, I can get it for you.</sentence><sentence id="4672">It's available in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.579668" long="8.699225">Giessen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4673">It does not fit his personality.</sentence><sentence id="4674">It does not fit his other reports.</sentence><sentence id="4675">It does not fit the man because he very well knew and realized that, on some level, Rumkowski was collaborating.</sentence><sentence id="4676">He followed orders.</sentence><sentence id="4677">Whether he followed orders because he really believed it would buy us life or time, or whether he didn't have the courage to do anything else, because he made it very clear any kind of resistance would not be appreciated is a mild word, would not be tolerated.</sentence><sentence id="4678">So, this last entry to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumkowski</span> could have only meant that he took it there and got some sort of a reward, which meant additional food, a loaf of bread, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4679">His daughter was my age and I met her through him, and his son was two or three years older, and he cultivated the girls whose father belonged to the police and to other important <span class="BUILDING">ghetto institutions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4680">He worked in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> as an electrician.</sentence><sentence id="4681">Strangely enough, Dr. Singer, a very educated man and so was his wife, did not send either one of his kids to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and he could have because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> was not <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4682">Whether they would not have been college material, I really cannot judge.</sentence><sentence id="4683">But</sentence><sentence id="4685">3 both had trades.</sentence><sentence id="4686">The daughter was a seamstress and the son an electrician.</sentence><sentence id="4687">The wife came from a German-speaking family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, a very bright, very nice woman.</sentence><sentence id="4688">His sister was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4689">Her husband had been arrested after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> was occupied, and one did not know his whereabouts, and she had a longstanding, ongoing connection with the director of the <span class="BUILDING">electrical component factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4690">And then there were two elderly ladies living in the same <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4691">They had almost a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span

portion to work everyday.</sentence><sentence id="4693">So, I trusted her with my bread.</sentence><sentence id="4694">What else can I say of the Singer?</sentence><sentence id="4695">The two old ladies, especially one of them, was his landlady Roztoky, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4696">No children, very wealthy.</sentence><sentence id="4697">I think the husband died or was killed -- or he died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4698">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, these two ladies made out a last will and testament in favor of Dr.Singer.</sentence><sentence id="4699">I was, about six years ago, at <span class="BUILDING">Sonoma State University</span>, and the director of Holocaust Studies is John Steiner.</sentence><sentence id="4700">John is only very partly Jewish, but he made it through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in spite of the fact that he never knew he was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="4701">It turns out that one of the ladies living with Dr. Singer was his aunt.</sentence><sentence id="4702">He knew Dr. Singer before the war, and his daughter was his girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="4703">So, I told him the story about the will, and he's now -- I mean, the will was lost in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- he's trying to regain the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> near <span class="DLF">park</span>, and there was also a bank account by the same aunt in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, but the name and the numbers have never appeared.</sentence><sentence id="4704">So, after 50 years, to come across this little old lady again is very strange.</sentence><sentence id="4705">I found it in a way strange only it was resourceful that Dr. Singer asked the two ladies to make out their last will.</sentence><sentence id="4706">On some level, he must have thought that he would survive the war, because otherwise, why would you do it?</sentence><sentence id="4707">His son had, at times, a radio.</sentence><sentence id="4708">It was in poor shape, it needed constant repair.</sentence><sentence id="4709">We only got the BBC and the progress of the war -- nothing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, nothing</sentence><sentence id="4711">4 about our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, nothing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, no idea.</sentence><sentence id="4712">No mention was ever made by Dr.Singer of a place like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4713">No mention was made by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neftalin</span>, by Spiegel.</sentence><sentence id="4714">It just was not mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="4715">So, it can be assumed that we really didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="4716">Maybe somebody knew, but I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4778">Q: And nobody mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4780">A: No, that you saw from the letter which I got in "47 where it stated they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and it turned out they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4781">So, that is much later information.</sentence><sentence id="4782">The work for Dr. Singer was effortless.</sentence><sentence id="4783">It was boring.</sentence><sentence id="4784">It was dull.</sentence><sentence id="4785">I was a clerk.</sentence><sentence id="4786">It was a large, dark <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, and it was terribly lonely, whereas the previous <span class="BUILDING">office</span> had people.</sentence><sentence id="4787">Until one day when I got a phone call, would I please appear in <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> outside the Balutski Renneck (ph), and there was Rumkowski, and he told me that I would work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">evening kitchen</span> together with 40 other young women my age who had been for six months in the women's police corps, and they wore uniforms just like the men.</sentence><sentence id="4788">They were mostly young women who had finished matura (ph) either before they <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in deg40, and they strutted around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in their police uniforms, gray with an orange band, and it was a police corps that lasted probably eight months.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4828">A: Threatened me for seeing him.</sentence><sentence id="4829">He told me that he knew.</sentence><sentence id="4830">Who had carried the information, I don't know, but it was common in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to trade information, to talk to the administration about anything or to denounce people, to no particular gain other than maybe you got a little reward for it, but just to carry gossip.</sentence><sentence id="4831">The young policewomen were all waitresses.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4848">A: I didn't tell him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4850">Q: Is it possible that Rumkowski went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spiegel</span> and said, "Stop"?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5668">A: He had the power to do so.</sentence><sentence id="5669">My crying probably stalled for time, or gave me time, and the time was the food ran out and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> had to be closed, and everybody in that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">leather factory</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">Saddlery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5670">So-</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5755">Q: So, did you explain to the doctor what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5785">Q: Was she, the doctor, shocked at what you told her about what Rumkowski was doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5787">A: I don't think she was shocked.</sentence><sentence id="5788">She was an older woman who probably had children my age.</sentence><sentence id="5789">She was well-known.</sentence><sentence id="5790">She was an MD.</sentence><sentence id="5791">She was not a fe/czer, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had a lot of doctors that were -- like, what should I say -- first-aid man, or medical corpsman and they were called a felczer, from falsifying the word comes, but they were called doctors because</sentence><sentence id="5793">03 there was a scarcity of doctors and <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> otherwise, and she was too smart and too intelligent and probably slightly amused.</sentence><sentence id="5794">I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5805">Q: Amused?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5841">A: She told me that she had known him since childhood, since the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, but their relationship, their talk was so relaxed and so easy, it wasn't on the basis of "Sir."</sentence><sentence id="5842">It was on the basis of "you", and you don't call the president "you;" you call him "Mr. President."</sentence><sentence id="5843">Even in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="5844">So, it was fairly obvious that there was a connection, somehow, somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="5847">04</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5856">Q: Did she in some sense after all these years, gain some power, now that she was a woman and not a girl, with him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
