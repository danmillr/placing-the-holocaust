<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="812">Q: What was it like to see them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="814">A: It was a shock because I myself did not see myself.</sentence><sentence id="815">There were no mirror, you couldn't tell how I looked.</sentence><sentence id="816">I was shocked by their appearance in rags, unwashed, not well nourished as you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="817">And they were shocked by my appearance.</sentence><sentence id="818">I was totally emaciated, unkept, in rags and I could tell from the expression on their face that I was not a very well sight to look at.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="824">Q: Had you known that they were also in hiding?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="826">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="827">It was a planned situation that we knew that they were in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="828">We did not know where and we had no concept of the geographic location of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">But we did know that they were alive and as the plan was, to divide us up, it was not a surprise that they were close by.</sentence><sentence id="830">The <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> they were at was designated by their farmer as only for two people and when the farmer walked in and saw an additional person he said, "No way.</sentence><sentence id="831">I did not agree to three."</sentence><sentence id="832">We tried to bribe him and give him some more gold.</sentence><sentence id="833">He took it and then next day changed his mind.</sentence><sentence id="834">He said, "You gotta go."</sentence><sentence id="835">And so again, Abram was caught between having to take us out of this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and not finding another.</sentence><sentence id="836">We were chased out, by now it was turning cold and winter snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="837">I was very weak, practically unable to walk and Abram was just trying to help by finding another <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was no avail.</sentence><sentence id="838">I was begging him to leave me there on the cold white snow.</sentence><sentence id="839">I could not walk anymore.</sentence><sentence id="840">The wind was fierce in an open <span class="DLF">field</span>, the snow was blowing, and I, all I wanted is to be left alone.</sentence><sentence id="841">But Abram said, "As God is my witness, I'm not gonna let you die."</sentence><sentence id="842">And he carried me on his shoulders and he was alternating.</sentence><sentence id="843">My father did a little bit carrying and we wandered days in that bitter cold in the white snow until we spotted a dark object far away.</sentence><sentence id="844">Abram ventured out by leaving us on the snow and moving forward to examine what it was, came back few feet, telling us that it looked like it's a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that we have no choice but try to go towards it.</sentence><sentence id="845">We chose to wait there in the snow while he himself ventured out.</sentence><sentence id="846">He</sentence><sentence id="848">1 dared to walk into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and came out alive, coming back to us and carrying us, carrying me back into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="849">It turned out to be an isolated little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> in the prairie and the cold snow, a very very poor farmer allowing us, agreeing to take us in.</sentence><sentence id="850">We entered the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> which was totally empty.</sentence><sentence id="851">This time there was neither a horse nor a cow nor hay.</sentence><sentence id="852">We lay down on the cold <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> just waiting.</sentence><sentence id="853">The farmer was very poor.</sentence><sentence id="854">It was one of these, God's people really, that had nothing worldly around him.</sentence><sentence id="855">He had children, they had no shoes, therefore stayed <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="856">Therefore the danger of them running into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was diminished.</sentence><sentence id="857">He explained to us that he had a cow that died because he could not feed her so he had no milk.</sentence><sentence id="858">His crop died in that cold weather and he had no bread and the gold that we gave him was no avail to him because he could not go into the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> to buy anything because he was known to be the poorest soul in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="859">So on a Sunday we would have some potatoes but he was so poor that he couldn't afford any salt.</sentence><sentence id="860">But he was good-hearted and really sympathized with our fate.</sentence><sentence id="861">For some time we stayed there until one day we heard shots.</sentence><sentence id="862">These were very distant and we did not pay much attention until the farmer came and said, "Do you know the war's approaching.</sentence><sentence id="863">The Russians are coming nearer and nearer and they are beating the Germans and you're going to be free soon."</sentence><sentence id="864">We did not believe that.</sentence><sentence id="865">We continued to remain in the same <span class="NPIP">position</span>, very pessimistic and doubting whether we would ever get out alive from these <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">One night, we heard very close shots.</sentence><sentence id="867">Prior to those shots, we heard this lamenting of human beings was was, which was so painful, was like these lamenting cats that sometime cry at night.</sentence><sentence id="868">It was so close that we thought that it's approaching us and soon engulf us in it.</sentence><sentence id="869">I remember thinking is this how you die, by hearing these voices coming out of nowhere?</sentence><sentence id="870">Pretty soon, we heard some voices knocking, some sound knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> and later we learned that Abraham, his little girl and his wife, at the last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at.</sentence><sentence id="871">Abram and his wife and daughter were dragged out into the open <span class="DLF">field</span>, close to this <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> and shot to death.</sentence><sentence id="872">Thus was the end of Abraham after all these wanderings.</sentence><sentence id="873">After all these narrow escapes, the friendly farmer, the farmer that Abraham fed and provided clothing and provided food for his family and his animals, thus was the end of Abraham, shot by his own quote unquote friendly farmer.</sentence><sentence id="874">The man</sentence><sentence id="876">2 that was totally a stranger to us, our farmer, explained to us that the knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> was one of the militia men that asked him to go out and bury those bodies.</sentence><sentence id="877">The farmer described these three bodies laying in blood and the blood was still warm, melting the white snow.</sentence><sentence id="878">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was so frozen that he couldn't dig any <span class="DLF">holes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">After while, he just had to leave them there and cover them up with the snow.</sentence><sentence id="880">Days after, the farmer came back to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> saying, "You know, the end is here.</sentence><sentence id="881">The Russians are coming."</sentence><sentence id="882">We did not believe it.</sentence><sentence id="883">He said, "Look, you can come into my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="884">His <span class="BUILDING">house</span> really consisted of one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where five people were living, three children and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="885">His wife was ill and was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="886">But we did not dare leave that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> until one knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> convinced us that freedom is here.</sentence><sentence id="887">He came in, the farmer came in, just refused to close that <span class="DLF">door</span> and dragged that, dragged us into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="888">By then, soldiers came in and he explained us that the Russians are here.</sentence><sentence id="889">The Russians indeed were there.</sentence><sentence id="890">They were friendly.</sentence><sentence id="891">My father, teaching himself the Russian language, started talking to them with tears in his eyes.</sentence><sentence id="892">My mother, I remember, was kissing their hands and the Russian soldiers were patting her saying, "Devie (ph), devie (ph)," which means no, no, don't have to do that.</sentence><sentence id="893">We are here to liberate you.</sentence><sentence id="894">And then they saw me and they lifted me up and said indeed, that's a yehvooshkod (ph), that's a little girl.</sentence><sentence id="895">They saw that we barely were breathing and embraced us and brought in cases of food and prepared us for departure.</sentence><sentence id="896">We knew that we couldn't stay in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> any longer, that we had to move forward because the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> was right there.</sentence><sentence id="897">There were bombs exploding all around us.</sentence><sentence id="898">The Russians dropped us off at the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and despite the fact that quote unquote we were liberated, the danger was lurking behind each and every <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="899">The Ukrainian population was not very friendly to survivors.</sentence><sentence id="900">They were trying to kill us at every moment that we took a step in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="901">At one moment, a, one of the villagers lifted his, an ax, trying to chop off our heads, when a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tank</span> rolled by and noticed that and shot the man on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="902">I remember the villagers standing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and pointing at us and we had to protect ourselves by hiding behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> that were rolling by.</sentence><sentence id="903">I remember my father going over to one of the villagers saying, pointing to me saying, "You see, she doesn't have any horns on her head.</sentence><sentence id="904">She's just a little girl like yours."</sentence><sentence id="905">And then the farmer spit in his face.</sentence><sentence id="906">The Russian Army was really the key to our survival.</sentence><sentence id="907">They took us</sentence><sentence id="909">3 in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> despite the limitations and regulations not to pick up civilians.</sentence><sentence id="910">They brought us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and until the, a certain <span class="NPIP">destination</span> where they could not move on any longer.</sentence><sentence id="911">They placed me in a <span class="BUILDING">farmer's home</span> and instructed the farmer to light the fire in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>, made room for me to stay in a <span class="NPIP">warm place</span>, brought in cases of Spam and ordered the farmer to feed us,
