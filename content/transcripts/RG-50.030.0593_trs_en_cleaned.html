<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: A little bit.</sentence><sentence id="261">I played the violin at that time, and I know they made me play the violin on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, because many Jewish families bought expensive musical instruments to give to their children to take out, so that they could be sold for money later.</sentence><sentence id="262">And so the Nazis wanted to make sure that I could play the violin,</sentence><sentence id="264">Interview with Erica Kanter me October 15, 2010 and I did, and I remember I played "Ach du lieber Augustine," which was a famous song at the time for children.</sentence><sentence id="265">But that's all I really remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
