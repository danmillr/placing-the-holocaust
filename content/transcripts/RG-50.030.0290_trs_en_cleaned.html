<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: You had a nice life.</sentence><sentence id="192">Did it ever occur to you that that would be taken away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="196">Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, I always expected to survive.</sentence><sentence id="197">And I really attributed it to my father.</sentence><sentence id="198">I'm serious, because in retrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came.</sentence><sentence id="199">He really instilled in me a tremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll make it if you want it badly enough.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Now, you were mentioning that you were starting to get concerned after the Russians came in.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: That's right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Did you continue to practice Jewish holidays and all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us.</sentence><sentence id="253">Probably the people who were religious it affected them.</sentence><sentence id="254">But I don't recall going to <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> that year for all the high holidays.</sentence><sentence id="255">That's something that is kind of murky in my mind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Do you remember the first day of the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Yes, I do, very much so.</sentence><sentence id="262">It was 1941, June 21, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="263">That was a day that I was supposed to go to my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, my original <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to pick up my diploma because I had graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to put on a pair of silk stockings.</sentence><sentence id="265">I walked to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was quite a distance, and I picked up my diploma.</sentence><sentence id="266">It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and as I passed where the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> lived, suddenly something fell out from an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span>, because they bombed the <span class="INT_SPACE">President's quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">I fell on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">I got up.</sentence><sentence id="269">I wasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings.</sentence><sentence id="270">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that we did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, and we hoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at that time.</sentence><sentence id="271">We were already caught between the <span class="NPIP">devil</span> and the ,</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Can you describe the atmosphere in the <span class="DLF">street</span> at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: You saw this and this was just all around?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Oh, all around us, all around us, yes.</sentence><sentence id="301">We kept our <span class="DLF">door</span> locked, and we were lucky that they must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down our <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">They were terrible, unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="303">It was such like, like I said, I never had any contact with them before, but they turned like animals.</sentence><sentence id="304">It was just neighbors, people who you dealt with.</sentence><sentence id="305">They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs and so it was rough.</sentence><sentence id="306">It was really rough.</sentence><sentence id="307">You know, I read a book by an author by the name of Bothenheimer (ph).</sentence><sentence id="308">He's a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="309">I'm just telling you a little story about it.</sentence><sentence id="310">I belong to a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they were being taken by the Germans to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and that eventually they would be staying there until after the war.</sentence><sentence id="311">I was the only survivor.</sentence><sentence id="312">The rest of the people in the group were Americans.</sentence><sentence id="313">And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could you be.</sentence><sentence id="314">Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans?</sentence><sentence id="315">Couldn't you just stand up against the Lithuanians?</sentence><sentence id="316">There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers around you.</sentence><sentence id="317">And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak, or that we were like sheep.</sentence><sentence id="318">We had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="319">How can you just protect yourself against a bunch of mad dogs.</sentence><sentence id="320">You just can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="321">I mean people did it, and they were immediately killed in front of you.</sentence><sentence id="322">So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it without making any waves.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Now, in the first few days after the bombs were dropped and the Lithuanians were running around beating people, can you describe what else was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: Not really, not really.</sentence><sentence id="349">Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="350">We wouldn't dare walk out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until they came around with those loud speakers directing us what to do.</sentence><sentence id="351">But we packed.</sentence><sentence id="352">We packed mostly silver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't experienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less than that, we lived a relative normal life.</sentence><sentence id="353">Really, a normal life, but when something happens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest.</sentence><sentence id="354">You kind of know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="355">And you start thinking, you don't need a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, you don't need extra clothes, you need something that you can trade eventually.</sentence><sentence id="356">So, we took the silver and some of the jewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something, because there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold here now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold.</sentence><sentence id="357">It was not synthetic.</sentence><sentence id="358">And we knew that the farmers <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> will be glad to acquire it, to exchange.</sentence><sentence id="359">Not that we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Now, I know a lot of people were herded up, right away taken outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and killed.</sentence><sentence id="373">Was this something that you were aware of at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: No, no I found out later on.</sentence><sentence id="377">Like I said, we were just lucky.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Did you have any contact with the Jewish part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span> (ph), at this point, or were you separated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
