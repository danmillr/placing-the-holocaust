the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1754">So they had to get the permission from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> next door and that's a <span

<span class="DLF">wall</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1755">And my son-in-law -- one of my son-in-laws passed by there after they had the ceremony, and there was a mother and a little girl.</sentence><sentence id="1756">And I don't know whether they're speaking German or -- somehow he understood what they said.</sentence><sentence id="1757">And I don't know what the mother said to the little girl, but the little girl said, what's a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1758">Which sort of gave us the chills, you
