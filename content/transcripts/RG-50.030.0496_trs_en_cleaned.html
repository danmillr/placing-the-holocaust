<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="51">Now, I -- I have no idea whether it's possible to do this, but as we're speaking, since you were such a young person, if there's a way for you to distinguish what you really remember</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: -- as that kid, versus what you were told later, if there's a way of doing that as we speak --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: -- it would be -- it would be very helpful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I think so.</sentence><sentence id="58">Of course, it's anybody's guess how accurate I am about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: But it's -- it's certainly true that I am able to at least comment about what I think are later deductions as opposed to early memories, mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="64">Be glad to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Let's talk a little bit about your family, your -- let's talk first about your father, who has one of those longest names that I've ever heard in my life.</sentence><sentence id="68">Can you give us his full name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl Cohen.</sentence><sentence id="72">Did I leave out one?</sentence><sentence id="73">Oh, Frederick --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Jacque Theobold Alfred Karl --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: I may have left out --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Frederick.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Frederick, right, Cohen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Where do all these names come from, do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I don't know because my paternal grandparents had already died when I was old enough to remember anything as a toddler.</sentence><sentence id="86">So I have no idea where they came from.</sentence><sentence id="87">It may also have been</sentence><sentence id="89">the fashion at the time to give people more than -- although that's not really true because my uncle who was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, only had one name.</sentence><sentence id="90">So maybe it had to do with Sephardic as opposed to Ashkenazic Jews.</sentence><sentence id="91">Maybe it had to do with <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> versus <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">Maybe it had to do with whatever the background of my father's parents was, which I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="93">I don't know what their occupation was or anything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: Do you remember if he was called Jacque?</sentence><sentence id="106">Was he known by his first name, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: He was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: And what did he do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: He actually was a baker, but a baker in American parlance has sort of -- sort of a vague meaning, but the kind of baker he was, was one of these European bakers who did all these specialty desserts.</sentence><sentence id="115">And he -- I only recently learned from my sister, my older sister, that he was a baker on the Holland<span class="DLF">-America line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">And apparently before he was married, he -- that's what he did.</sentence><sentence id="117">And at some point, I don't exactly know where in -- in the yearly chronology, he decided he wasn't going to do this any more.</sentence><sentence id="118">And they prevailed on him to do it once more, and do it once more, and I guess he did it, he did -- went one more trip and they said we want you to take one more trip, and I -- I guess he put his foot down and said, I'm not doing it any more.</sentence><sentence id="119">And the -- that voyage, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that he said no to apparently was detonated by some torpedo that was left over from World War I. So that whatever it was, fate, whatever, saved him when he decided no, he wasn't going to do this any more.</sentence><sentence id="120">But that's what he did.</sentence><sentence id="121">And he had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, but I was never there, and we had already moved from there when I was born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: So when you were born, did he have the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: I think he still owned the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>, but he didn't work at it.</sentence><sentence id="136">And I -- I know that he left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> every day, but I'm not really sure where he went.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: And the only baking that I was familiar with was what he did on Sunday mornings.</sentence><sentence id="142">It was traditional that he baked a pound cake.</sentence><sentence id="143">And so the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always filled with this wonderful smell of baked goods, and his pound cake was incomparable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: [have spent my life trying to find one like it, but it is impossible, it seems.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Is that one of your earliest memories --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: -- of your father, is -- is baking at -- the pound cake?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="155">A: Well actually, the more prevalent and early memory is probably one of -- of him playing games with me.</sentence><sentence id="156">Being left at the dinner or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">breakfast table</span> with my father is an early memory, because I didn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="157">And they used to say I lived off the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">I just was not a child who ate a lot, and I -- or at all, and so he was the one elected to amuse me and tell me stories.</sentence><sentence id="159">And he would pull out the contents of his pockets and make up stories, and then occasionally try to slide a spoonful of something or other in my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="160">And that -- that's sort of my earliest recollection, it -- it's one of the very early ones.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Huh.</sentence><sentence id="168">You took walks with your father also.</sentence><sentence id="169">Was -- was that after the occupation, or do you remember [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: I very much remember it before also.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Also.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: It was sort of our special time of day together, and he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from -- as I say from wherever, I don't know from where.</sentence><sentence id="177">And -- and then he and I would go for a walk just the two of us, and we would walk in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, around the <span class="DLF">block</span> or whatever, and it -- it was both before the occupation and for a short time after.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Did he also walk with your sister, or was this very special for you?</sentence><sentence id="181">Do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Ifhe walked with my sister I don't know about it, but he may have been one of these wonderful parents who knew how to make each child feel very special and -- and he probably did something with her, or maybe a walk or something else with her.</sentence><sentence id="185">I-I don't know, I actually never asked her.</sentence><sentence id="186">But there was always this little bit of time for us, and it was generally -- I don't remember if it was after or before supper, but it was either very late in the afternoon, or early evening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: And you'd have conversations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: And would you tell -- would he ask you what your day was like, was that the -- or was it different?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: I don't think he asked me what my day was like.</sentence><sentence id="197">My sort of recollection, and as I say here, I'm not really sure this is a recollection or whether I imagined this, that we talked at a child's level about something very present.</sentence><sentence id="198">There wasn't stuff about what did you do, or what are you going to do, but more -- more about do you hear that bird singing, or s-something rooted in the present that a -- a -- rooted in the experience we were having together at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Was his way of behaving with you, it -- as -- from what you can remember, different from other fathers?</sentence><sentence id="203">It doesn't sound like the usual story of a father being so concerned about the kids.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: | -- if I say this is unusual, it comes from a -- a long backwards and adult perspective and certainly not a child's memory because I had no idea what another father might have been like.</sentence><sentence id="210">But I would say yes.</sentence><sentence id="211">I would say for several reasons.</sentence><sentence id="212">Number one, he was an extremely gentle and patient man, which is the reason he took -- took all the stuff out of his pocket forever and ever and ever, and in fact one of those things sort of backfired, because I knew that among the treasures he had in his pocket was a small pair of scissors.</sentence><sentence id="213">And one time he and I were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and we had very heavy oak, dark, dark oak <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, sort of dark, dark -- you know that heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">European furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">And over the big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the middle of this <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> -- w-why this <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> had this great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> sort of like -- more like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span>, I don't know, but that's the way it was set up.</sentence><sentence id="215">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> had these heavy crosspieces underneath.</sentence><sentence id="216">And there was a plush tablecloth, if you can imagine, it's more the kind of thing you can imagine over a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, but it was over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and it had long fringes on it, and it was over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in such a way that the points of the cloth were on the ends and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="217">And it was great <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me, I always had my little <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span> there, it was a little -- like a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I asked to borrow the scissors one day, and I climbed under there and I gave the tablecloth a haircut.</sentence><sentence id="218">Not fun at the time.</sentence><sentence id="219">But was he different?</sentence><sentence id="220">I think he was also different because I think my mother was probably an early feminist in many ways, although I don't think she called herself that at the time.</sentence><sentence id="221">She was the working partner in the <span class="BUILDING">hou</span> -- in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the time that I remember, anyway, and she had, apparently, a very unusual and important job for a woman in some kind of financial activity.</sentence><sentence id="222">Just exactly what it was, I never really knew or understood, and - - so she was out of my circle for much of the day.</sentence><sentence id="223">She was also not the one who was either as patient or as fun loving as I re-remember my father being.</sentence><sentence id="224">Not that my father was necessarily fun</sentence><sentence id="226">loving, but he was -- h-he smiled readily, as opposed to maybe yelling at me, which is more what I remember from my mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="248">So she was the disciplinarian.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Probably, although from my point of view it wasn't -- you know, it was never fair, and it was never --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="253">So who took care of you during the day then, if you -- both of your parents are out -- you don't know what your father's doing, but your mother's certainly working.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="255">Well, it wasn't unusual for people of even modest means to have help in those days.</sentence><sentence id="256">I mean, this is now the 30's we're talking.</sentence><sentence id="257">And we did have what was known as a meisje, or a girl, who -- who worked for us, and -- and in fact I remember -- I -- I remember s -- being served, when I was still in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, I remember her bringing me breakfast in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, and the breakfast consisted of these things called Dutch rusk.</sentence><sentence id="258">I don't know if you know what those are, but it's sort of a light and airy kind of toasty thing of about a half an inch thick.</sentence><sentence id="259">And she always had them drenched in honey.</sentence><sentence id="260">And so she would bring me these things in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, and the honey would be all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I hated it.</sentence><sentence id="261">I just despised it, and everything was st -- then sticky and drippy, and you know, and you can imagine a toddler in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, and the honey.</sentence><sentence id="262">So yes, I think she was probably one that took care of us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: So how old do you think you were when you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>?</sentence><sentence id="273">Two, three?</sentence><sentence id="274">Ye -- ye -- I mean, that's a clear memory for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: It's a very clear memory, and since it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, I must have been two or so.</sentence><sentence id="279">Couldn't -- couldn't leave that sticky memory behind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: And your sist -- tell me what your mother -- what -- what was your mother's name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Rosa, Rosa Schwarz.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: And was there difference in your parent's age, do you know?</sentence><sentence id="293">Or were they pretty close together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I-I'm not really sure.</sentence><sentence id="297">It's possible that my mother was maybe a year older or so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Or maybe more.</sentence><sentence id="303">I-I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="304">I know my mother was a very -- with me was a very late parent -- mother.</sentence><sentence id="305">I mean, there are eight years difference between my sister and me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: And I think that she married rather late, as well, so I'm -- yeah, I'm -- I'm sort of guessing that she was in her 40's when I was born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="315">Hm.</sentence><sentence id="316">Was pretty late then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: And your sister Betsy was eight years older than you.</sentence><sentence id="323">And do you have a recollection as a kid, of this older sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Oh yes, very clearly, because I -- in addition to -- to a meisje who was taking care of us, she obviously as the big sister was often put in charge, and I always resented that terribly.</sentence><sentence id="327">And I think my poor sister suffered horribly because of that, because I would probably always giver her a hard time.</sentence><sentence id="328">I guess I was fairly headstrong.</sentence><sentence id="329">I'm not above throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, yelling and crying, and my poor sister had to put up with all that.</sentence><sentence id="330">So -- yeah, and -- and basically, I think my sister and I are -- are -- are somewhat different personalities to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="331">So I don't think that was an easy thing for her, and -- and it wasn't fun for me, you know, and there was -- it created this sister sibling sort of irritation.</sentence><sentence id="332">I because I didn't want to be told that I couldn't do something, and she because I didn't want to do what she said I had to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Right, right.</sentence><sentence id="347">What was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like where you lived?</sentence><sentence id="348">Did you live in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, did you live in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="352">A: No, actually we lived in -- we lived in this very, very -- I guess bourgeois is probably the English equivalent word for it, but in a -- a very, very nice residential area, not too far from the <span class="BUILDING">Rijksmuseum</span>, on the Pieter de Hooch Straat.</sentence><sentence id="353">And it was all residential, so there was no commercial activity going on there at all, which makes the presence of what was going on in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> even more puzzling, because my mother worked in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, in -- in two rooms of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was this contore or -- or <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, as she would call it.</sentence><sentence id="354">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> as you -- well, certainly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> are built so that they are smack up against each other.</sentence><sentence id="355">And there is no sort of stand alone <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">And it goes all the way around the four sides of a <span class="DLF">block</span> that way.</sentence><sentence id="357">And what you have is people living on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>, people living on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and another couple second, and another on the third.</sentence><sentence id="358">And then the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> part, what we called <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>, or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caw</span> -- or <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, has access to the <span class="DLF">backyards</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">And the <span class="DLF">backyards</span> are all pretty private, all surrounded by wooden <span class="DLF">fences</span>, both in the middle and on the sides.</sentence><sentence id="360">So you really have a-again, a -- a greater European sense of privacy, while at the same time you can see into those yards from the first, second and <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span>, not only of your <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, but the one next to you on either side, and the one behind you from the other <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">So there's -- yes, there is privacy, and no there isn't privacy in -- in some way.</sentence><sentence id="362">And this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we had was brick, as most <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were, and there is not the <span class="DLF">front lawn</span> kind of thing, and there's not the -- the <span class="DLF">curb lawn</span> and so forth as we know it here, but -- but a <span class="DLF">city street</span>, really, although it was residential.</sentence><sentence id="363">And we had -- that was unusual too, we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> part and the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">But the first f -- two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> were this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">But there was nothing on the <span class="DLF">front door</span>, there was no mark of any kind, or title, or -- or -- or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="366">So I'm still a little bit</sentence><sentence id="368">0 at a loss as to what this outfit was, I'm only learning now from my sister who were the name -- what were the names of some of the -- well, I did know one of the names, th-the boss was Mr.Halle.</sentence><sentence id="369">And I know that my mother disappeared in these two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for much of the day, but that's about the extent of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="391">Q: So sh -- you don't know if she was an accountant, or she was a -- noth -- you have no idea?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="490">A: [have a clear recollection of the beginning of this sort of -- what I later understood as a really sort of maniacal way of building up the fear in the population.</sentence><sentence id="491">So the first time that I was aware that there was a major difference going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was the fact that I had started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and then I had stopped <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">So that was probably the first, although it might have been preceded by taking one of these walks with my dad, and the same wonderful walks that we used to take, and going down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, I remember the -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> opposite our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">It wasn't the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to, but it was some other <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and again there was no <span class="DLF">lawn</span> in the front, but they did have these sort of both ornamental and -- and physical heavy iron chains.</sentence><sentence id="494">And L used to love to sit on those and swing on them.</sentence><sentence id="495">But I wasn't doing that with my father, we were</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="499">3 -- we were going out for a walk and going down the <span class="DLF">block</span> and turning right as we did, and I remember there on the opposite, diagonally opposite side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> used to be an empty lot.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="500">And all of a sudden this particular day we went there, and it was all surrounded in <span class="DLF">wooden fencing</span>, but not your attractive <span class="DLF">fencing</span> or whatever, but in these -- it's the stuff that they used to have around baseball -- corner lot baseball thing -- I mean, I don't know -- exactly know how to say it, but you couldn't -- there were these vertical planks next to each other and you couldn't look through them.</sentence><sentence id="501">And so all of a sudden there is no empty lot except for this <span class="DLF">wooden fencing</span> all around, and all of a sudden there is an <span class="DLF">opening</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, a <span class="DLF">door</span> and a -- and a Nazi soldier walks out.</sentence><sentence id="502">And he is striding down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he comes towards my father and he asks him for a light for his cigarette.</sentence><sentence id="503">And I -- I remember almost as if it was yesterday, that my father, this patient, gentle man, really tensed, and lit the soldier's cigarette.</sentence><sentence id="504">And the soldier very politely said thank you and walked on.</sentence><sentence id="505">And my father swore under his breath.</sentence><sentence id="506">And I could sense this man's behavior was so out of character from how I knew him, that I knew that there was something amiss, but I, again had no -- no -- certainly no knowledge at the time what that meant.</sentence><sentence id="507">And what he said under his breath was Rotmof.</sentence><sentence id="508">Rotmof being the -- mof being the derogatory term used for the Nazis, and the rot meaning rotten.</sentence><sentence id="509">You know, so he was saying basically, rotten Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="510">And I didn't know what Nazi meant, and I couldn't understand why he would be saying this.</sentence><sentence id="511">I -- when I saw this soldier coming out I didn't know s -- I didn't know from soldiers, I really didn't understand anything.</sentence><sentence id="512">If you're asking me what was my childhood memory, I knew he was a soldier, that was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: That was it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: -- that was it.</sentence><sentence id="515">And I only knew he was called a Rotmof, because that's what my father said.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: The -- the capitulization -- capitulization of the Dutch to the Nazis, as I understood it -- and I've only just recently begun to look at this, because for so many years, I felt this was not an <span class="REGION">area</span> I wanted to study, this was not an <span class="REGION">area</span> I wanted to look at as a scholar and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1111">Now, I'm beginning to have a little different sense, and -- and actually for a number of reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1112">But a -- as I understood it, it was somewhere around this time that -- that the Dutch government basically was a sort of government under the aegis of a Dutch -- a -- no, I think it was a Dutch Nazi general some -- some sort of person like that, named Seyss-Inquart, who was basically put in charge, where the -- whereas the queen -- I guess the queen and the -- and the royalty wasn't exactly the tuling figure anyway, given the Dutch combination of a constitutional monarchy, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1113">But the queen left for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the prince and princess and their children left for <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1114">And -- and actually later on I-I remember hearing some broadcasts of the queen speaking to us from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1115">But so this -- this -- putting this person in charge again, was -- was one of these pieces that I didn't -- I wasn't aware of at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1116">I mean, what does a little kid know about government and how it operates?</sentence><sentence id="1117">I didn't know where the rules were coming from that were being asked -- well, were being laid down.</sentence><sentence id="1118">I knew that there was something about the fact that we were not any longer having lots of red, white and blue flags out, and orange streamers on</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1121">1 the flag poles, which all represented <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">House of Orange</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1122">I don't remember seeing Nazi flags either, but I didn't see the Dutch flags.</sentence><sentence id="1123">And -- and it was again one of these ways of making things seem like they were normal.</sentence><sentence id="1124">So there was a government and it was issuing decrees, and this was a Dutch, presumably -- th-there was a fair amount of collusion among the Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Something that only has come to my knowledge somewhat from the experiences I had, but much more -- more real when I became an adult and read a little bit more, and heard a little bit more, because I'd always grown up thinking, you know, the Dutch were so wonderful, and the Dutch basically saved me, and my sister and my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1126">And they did that also to some other Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1127">But there was also a lot of collusion going on.</sentence><sentence id="1128">The NSB was -- the NSB was known as the party that was in collusion with the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1129">And it was -- i-it was probably a way in which -- in which all politics and occupation works, and which uncomfortably I'm aware of, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> does likewise, which is you find your way in to some society by a group of people with whom you associate and with whom you vision a common goal and you infiltrate, basically.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And so the -- the amount of collusion there was rather shockingly high, from my perspective.</sentence><sentence id="1131">Not one I'm tremendously proud of.</sentence><sentence id="1132"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span>, on the other hand, has had a long, historical tradition of religious freedom, going back to William of Orange, and was probably also one of the reasons that the Jews found receptive ground and receptive society, because they fled from so many places of persecution, including <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1133">So -- and actually my -- my grandparents, my father's parents came -- now | don't know if they directly or their parents came up from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, but then actually that's something that I'm hoping at some point to get back to The <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and do some of that research, because

Right.</sentence><sentence id="1139">Now, when -- when you remember back to that twilight when your father was taken, y- yi -- do you -- you remember these soldiers as being, or gestap -- we don't know what they are, you don't th -- what th-they are.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: I think they were Gestapo, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1142">Q: You think they were Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1143">They were polite with your father, so they weren't rough with him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1146">A: They very -- with -- these men, in my recollection were polite, they were soft-spoken, they were not m -- you know th -- a -- I don't remember at that particular time whether there was a heil Hitler associated with the interaction.</sentence><sentence id="1147">I don't remember if it was German or Dutch at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1148">I do remember at other times that it was German.</sentence><sentence id="1149">And I do remember at other times -- a- and this is something now again, I can't swear to.</sentence><sentence id="1150">I don't remember now whether I really heard this, or whether my current knowledge fills in the heil Hitler, I don't know, but I am pretty sure that some of those other times when he was arrested, I did hear it.</sentence><sentence id="1151">I don't remember it the night that he was arrested this time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1158">Q: Did he say goodbye to you when he was arrested, do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1160">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="1161">O-Or if he did it was probably -- again, I don't know if this was because he, as a parent he was trying not to create greater anxiety, or because he really thought he might be coming back again, the way he always had in these past times.</sentence><sentence id="1162">But I don't remember it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1166">Q: But -- so does he leave with anything, or he simply leaves -- he just goes out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1168">A: He just goes out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1170">Q: He just goes out.</sentence><sentence id="1171">So the <span class="DLF">door</span> closes, and your mother now makes a very radical decision.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And what is that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1180">A: Well, in retrospect, I don't know how radical it was, but she basically grabbed a bag, and I still remember the looks of the bag, it was sort of a yucky brown, n-no -- not an attractive bag, but some sort of satchel [indecipherable] satchel of some sort of plastic or leather, or something, and throws in a hairbrush, and a toothbrush and -- for each of us, grabs our jackets, takes us by the hand and walks out the <span class="DLF">door</span>, literally walks out the <span class="DLF">door</span> and closes the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind her.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And we walked -- a -- a -- and we -- she -- we had to come down <span class="DLF">steps</span>, it was up a couple steps, and we came down s -- and walked into the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I remember being aware of the fact that it was curfew, because Jews were not allowed on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, because there was a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="1182">They were not allowed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span>, they were not allowed in the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, they were not allowed in the <span class="DLF">parks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1183">Alla -- aya -- they were not allowed in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1184">And -- and these decrees, by the way, were not given all at once, they were -- this is why I keep reminding m-myself and others about the mind that was operating to keep upping the ante, to keep this level of normalcy, but just enough fear and enough intrusion into the way of life that it was clear who was in charge.</sentence><sentence id="1185">So one decree would be about you can't use the <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, and you -- so you say to yourself, well, alright, we can get along without the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1186">Next time it's the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Well, you know, we'll play in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span>, we go -- we won't take walks.</sentence><sentence id="1188">So it -- always it's also somehow to contain the population you're affecting, by making them adjust all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And -- and that adjustment, which is again something that if I -- if I can I may come back to later, but it's -- on the one hand, it's a peculiar characteristic of us humans, that we can adjust to an incredible amount of stuff before we say stop.</sentence><sentence id="1190">And in one <span class="NPIP">sense</span> we should have said stop right there, and we should have risen up and we should have said we won't take this.</sentence><sentence id="1191">And of course there were efforts at doing that, sporadically here and there.</sentence><sentence id="1192">But by and large, the effect of this layering is to keep the people from not boiling the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span>, and doing what I think Jewish populations have done since time</sentence><sentence id="1194">4 immemorial as guests in new societies, which is to say, well, you know, if we do what they ask, if we just comply with what people are asking us to do, then they" II leave us alone.</sentence><sentence id="1195">But they didn't leave us alone.</sentence><sentence id="1196">And so that's -- that always is something that comes to my mind when things happen, and I say, well should we accept this, or should we stand up and fight right here?And it a -- and one of these things happened in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> where the question came should we make a noise about this or should we not.</sentence><sentence id="1197">And -- and the general feeling of the Jewish community was led by the rabbi, which was, w-w-well, you know, we'll just let this go by kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1198">And mine, s -- much to my surprise, cause I'm not necessarily a person who makes waves, but I said this is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1199">It's not right, and we should be -- here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we should be calling attention to the fact that this is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1200">But anyway, the effect of this layering, as I say, was -- w-was t-to keep people in compliance, and to, at the same time instill this modicum of fear and anxiety.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And -- and I -- I -- I don't know what my father's feeling was at that point when he was taken away.</sentence><sentence id="1202">I don't know whether he himself had an inkling that this was different, or whether he really did think he was coming back, or -- I -- I -- I really don't know what they thought, and whether this is a question of radical behavior on my mother's part, yes and no, and it's probably a dual answer because as we walked across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and I longingly looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span>, I remember that cause I was little kid and I was tired and I wanted to ride.</sentence><sentence id="1203">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span>, I remember this eerie feeling as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span> were going by and I was -- they were totally empty.</sentence><sentence id="1204">There would be one person sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span>, because -- not that -- that the non-Jews weren't allowed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span>, but the general tenor in the -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was beginning to be much more concerned and so people weren't out going to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and doing stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And I remember us walking through the <span class="DLF">archway</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Rijksmuseum</span>, which is a gorgeous <span class="BUILDING">Victorian building</span> with all its <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> and spires and so forth and part of it is arched over a</sentence><sentence id="1207">5 <span class="DLF">roadway</span> which at that time still had the old fashioned heavy cobblestones that were like little miniature <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>, each one of them.</sentence><sentence id="1208">And our steps were re-echoing in that <span class="DLF">archway</span> as we walked through, and I remember feeling a certain amount of fear.</sentence><sentence id="1209">Cause I knew we were not supposed to be out.</sentence><sentence id="1210">And I knew that my mother was afraid and that she was anxious and we had to hurry and we had to be quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1211">And I knew that we couldn't help ourselves, there was this clatter of the footsteps.</sentence><sentence id="1212">And so the sense that somebody might be coming for us, or coming after us was definitely there, in -- in my head at that time, because I remember the feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1213">I didn't know why, but I had the feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1214">I knew that we were leaving and that we were going someplace else and we -- we -- the -- where we lived was called Amsterdam South, it was the southern part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and -- o-of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and we went to Amsterdam West, which was across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, through the western part, which was a much more commercial area.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1330">A: That's true.</sentence><sentence id="1331">Well, that's true, and of course there was this whole other activity that was going on, that I only learned about later, which was -- well, some of which I n -- I was aware of, which is that everybody had to have identity cards, and the Jewish ones had a big J stamped on it.</sentence><sentence id="1332">And I also knew, and I -- this was before, I believe before my father was taken, that a friend of the</sentence><sentence id="1334">7 family, who was a minister, actually provided us with fake baptism papers.</sentence><sentence id="1335">Because -- I-I remember that at the time, and I remember sort of hearing about it, and perhaps even be -- being given one of those t-to have on my person.</sentence><sentence id="1336">And of course, initially it was, I think as I mentioned, first when they started doing the calling up of Jews -- first of all, they also instituted another one of their pieces of madness.</sentence><sentence id="1337">They started this thing called Joods Raad, which was basically translated as the Jewish councils.</sentence><sentence id="1338">They -- they took various |-leaders within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and created a kind of a self governance piece, so that essentially they gave them the orders of what they wanted done, and they made them responsible for carrying it out.</sentence><sentence id="1339">So now what you're doing is you're creating this horrendous thing between people of the same marked, steri -- stigmatized group and saying, you do the dirty work, you choose who's going to be called up next.</sentence><sentence id="1340">You are the ones that promulgates the decrees of n-not -- no access of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and this and that and the other.</sentence><sentence id="1341">So the Jewish councils were having to do this to their own people.</sentence><sentence id="1342">And the -- the -- the tendency to first of all condemn these people roundly, I think is very great, because you're saying, you know, what the hell were you doing tell -- sending us off to the -- be slaughtered.</sentence><sentence id="1343">By the same token, I don't think they were all doing it from that perspective.</sentence><sentence id="1344">I think some of them were doing it because, as I said before, they thought that well, if we just comply with that they're asking, and maybe I can help to keep my people sort of understanding that if we just keep calm and do what they ask, we can get through this all right.</sentence><sentence id="1345">I think they were doing it from that perspective, some of them.</sentence><sentence id="1346">I think others probably were doing it to save their own skins, sort of either realizing whatever was happening it wasn't good, but if they volunteered to do this, then maybe they would not have to go.</sentence><sentence id="1347">And I have to say that, coming through this experience, I don't think any of us is ever able to say what we would or would not do under any circumstances such as these.</sentence><sentence id="1348">I don't think you know what you're capable of doing, I don't think</sentence><sentence id="1350">8 you know what you're capable of tolerating, I don't think you're cap -- yo-you have any sense of the reality of w-what you might do if you or your family members were under siege or in peril of losing their lives.</sentence><sentence id="1351">I just think it's impossible.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1846">A: Well, some of it actually is to be expected, in the sense that many people have the experience as parents of doing something together with other parents and there is a -- a disagreement about what youngsters can be allowed to do or not to do.</sentence><sentence id="1847">So there was some of this tension between the two mothers.</sentence><sentence id="1848">A-About what, I don't remember, do I have an example, no.</sentence><sentence id="1849">I just knew it was there.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And because there was such a spread in ages, it was also difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1851">There was s -- at least then, before my mother died, there was this.</sentence><sentence id="1852">There was also a kind of o-obvious -- and I -- and I have to confess that this is a thought that came long after and not before.</sentence><sentence id="1853">I knew there was</sentence><sentence id="1855">2 tension between the two parents as mothers, and kids have an intuition about that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1856">But there was something else and that had to do with the fact that clearly my mother -- my mother's freedom as a mother and a parent, and her freedom as far as objecting to and disagreements, and -- mean to -- to the kinds of disagreements, was severely limited because of the nature of this relationship.</sentence><sentence id="1857">We were totally and completely dependent on this family.</sentence><sentence id="1858">So my mother must have, many, many times, been severely pressed for patience and understanding and compromise and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1859">There was nothing she could do.</sentence><sentence id="1860">I mean, basically her only alternative was to be quiet and acquiesce, or to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1861">And -- and clearly she surely didn't want to do that, because there were the two of us also.</sentence><sentence id="1862">I don't know what she would have done if it was just herself.</sentence><sentence id="1863">So there was probably no real outlet for all that kind of frustration.</sentence><sentence id="1864">Plus the fact that we were getting -- we were getting some letters from my father, and they c -- apparently came from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> as he was being transported from one to the other, to the other, and then eventually the last I-letters came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1865">And the letters were always censored.</sentence><sentence id="1866">They were alway -- they had heavy, heavy black lines drawn through writing, and there was no way -- I remember my mother holding them up to the light and putting them over a bright light and on -- so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1867">They could not see what was -- what was under that.</sentence><sentence id="1868">And they came to us via a very roundabout route, having to do with some of Tante Toos's family.</sentence><sentence id="1869">I don't know if it was brother or brother- in-law, or how we got some of these things, but we did get these letters.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1918">Q: I don't know this for positive, but I sort of think so.</sentence><sentence id="1919">I-I -- I know that my sister has mentioned it several times, something of the family dynamic between the brothers and Tante Toos and -- and how often there was friction because of the fact that they were not wanting the sister to do this and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1920">Then there was another dynamic that took place here in this confined <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1924">First of all there was probably this -- this little kid who was always sort of -- sort of in-between and in the way and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1925">There was another dynamic going on between my sister and the young boy, after a fairly short time.</sentence><sentence id="1926">And every time I think about this whole experience, and as I then moved on in my life later and worked with young people and studied young people and everything else, I am always caught by the uniqueness of that ad-adolescent era that each of us has, but which in my sister's case was so totally rent asunder, so that just at the point when life opens up for you and you're no longer quite a child and you're now moving into domains of knowledge and you're beginning to have some feeling of what the world's about, and when you start thinking about future and making plans and having relationships, and having groups of friends, and beginning to pull away from your -- your parental u-unit as the kids used to say.</sentence><sentence id="1927">And this must have been so hard for her to have this cut off.</sentence><sentence id="1928">Yes, I was disappointed I couldn't go to</sentence><sentence id="1930">4 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so on, but the -- to compare that to what must have happened to my sister, it must have been so awful, to have everything just kind of collapsed, to have everything just sort of literally having the rug pulled out from under you and now you are in this sort of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, sort of confinement, really.</sentence><sentence id="1931">And then the knowledge that our very lives and futures depended on being able to s -- to make the most of what we have here, and to be able to get along, and to be able to make it work.</sentence><sentence id="1932">And -- and some of this has been written quite beautifully by Anne Frank, and -- where she talks about some of these dynamics between the rescuer and the protectors, and the family and the internal stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1933">And yeah, there was a lot of that going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1946">Q: So was there a kind of romance between Hans and Betsy, your sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1948">A: Yeah, I think so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1949">Q: Or the beginnings of one, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1950">A: -- it -- certainly the beginnings of one, and I think certainly by the time the three and a half years ended, there was more of it, and I think then, for that one year that we were still there after the war, I think there was more of it, and then some knowledge of -- of some new people her age that she -- his good friend and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1951">I th -- I think that this was really tough.</sentence><sentence id="1952">A-And I think there were expectations on her part when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that this might continue and it didn't and she had sort of no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go with her feelings.</sentence><sentence id="1953">So that -- that was terribly difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1954">Terribly difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1955">And I think that the -- the sense on the part of Tante Toos was very -- I mean, I think she really -- she cared, if not immediately, she certainly came to care for us very deeply.</sentence><sentence id="1956">And -- a-and again, as they say, afterwards, when my mother died, there was a new set of tangents, because she felt, I think in a very real sense, that it was her role as the adult maternal figure, to be the caretaker and caregiver.</sentence><sentence id="1957">I think my sister felt, as the person closest to me, and now the older, responsible adult, that she should be the one to basically kind of take the initiative</sentence><sentence id="1959">5 about what I should do or not do and what things I might be criticized for or not, as the case may be.</sentence><sentence id="1960">So there's the tension between those two.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2070">A: I don't have a -- any recollection that there was a particular time.</sentence><sentence id="2071">I don't even remember what actually transpired in those sessions.</sentence><sentence id="2072">I don't think that they lasted all of the time that we were in hiding, but they lasted long enough to get me to be able to read.</sentence><sentence id="2073">And -- and I'm sure she did some -- s-see again, we ha -- we had nothing, we ha -- we even had no paper.</sentence><sentence id="2074">You couldn't get anything any more.</sentence><sentence id="2075">You couldn't get crayons, you couldn't get colored -- well, we didn't really have crayons like they have Crayolas here.</sentence><sentence id="2076">We had colored pencils and we had a few because when the newspapers were still being published -- which also stopped, but while they were being published we didn't have the comic section like you do here, but we did have one which I recognized later was a political cartoon and -- and it was on the back of the front page of De Telegraaf, which was the sort of -- s-sa -- probably right of center newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="2077">And I would cut out -- after people had gotten through with the paper, I would cut out this little two or three frame thing and -- and color it with a few colored pencils that we had and that's one way I kept busy.</sentence><sentence id="2078">And I loved these characters, I thought they were just so much fun, but again, I was an animal lover.</sentence><sentence id="2079">And this was tom poes, which was tomcat, and Ollie B.

Bommel was a bear, and he was a pretty dumb bear.</sentence><sentence id="2081">And so it was always the smart cat who was rescuing him out of awkward situations or correcting his erroneous thinking.</sentence><sentence id="2082">And so the political stuff kind of came through that.</sentence><sentence id="2083">And this was my p-precious possession from -- from all of those years, and it's one of the few things that I had at the end of the war, cause I collected all these things until they stopped publishing, and I took them with me to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I kept them in the</sentence><sentence id="2085">9 <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and so forth and so on, and then at some later date many years later when I met my husband and he came to visit at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so forth, and I told him about this.</sentence><sentence id="2086">And he said, "Oh," he said, "do you have those around?"</sentence><sentence id="2087">I said oh yeah, and so I brought them down from the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>, and he opened the box and he grabbed them and the first thing he did was flip them over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, because there were the headlines of what was going on during those early years.</sentence><sentence id="2088">And I haven't tried to piece those headlines together, but I have started to do some research now on -- actually on the original newspapers, to see what was the context within which all of my personal experience was taking place.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2110">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2112">A: Because now, as an adult, I'm interested in knowing -- a-and not only interested in knowing, but I'm so appalled at some of the things that you keep seeing repeated and repeated and repeated in history.</sentence><sentence id="2113">Not the least of which was these kinds of left, right and so forth debates about how to interpret what the Nazis were doing, and so I actually have been looking at some of the newspapers on the left, and some of them on the right and some of the underground newspapers which were being published.</sentence><sentence id="2114">And some of that has proven to be very interesting -- very interesting to read.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3335">A: Some sort of resmi -- respiratory stuff comes back, bronchitis, which I had fairly often after that.</sentence><sentence id="3336">And my sister, in the best of efforts, took me to the <span class="BUILDING">ship's dispensary</span>, which had a Greek doctor, who was kind of -- I -- I don't know where his training was from, but what they did to me there was cupping.</sentence><sentence id="3337">And I don't know if you've ever heard of or read about cupping, but cupping is taking something the equivalent of maybe a shot glass -- no, a little bigger, whatever, cocktail glass or something, and you create a vacuum in the glass by lighting a match into it, and you use up the <span class="DLF">air</span> and the oxygen, and before you have a chance to fill that back in again, you press it down on the back.</sentence><sentence id="3338">And they put rows and rows of these glasses on my back.</sentence><sentence id="3339">And then, of course, because there's a -- a vacuum in the glass, the glass pulls the skin and everything with the skin into the glass.</sentence><sentence id="3340">And then you yank these glasses off.</sentence><sentence id="3341">So this provides -- what I decided the -- the reason for this was, to make you focus on some other pain, of such intensity that you forgot about what you really came for.</sentence><sentence id="3342">But it probably came from the medieval notion that if you get the blood moving, that you could get the ill humors out, or something.</sentence><sentence id="3343">And I was in huge pain, terrible pain, and I sat on a -- some -- some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> or other, some corner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>, swathed in blankets and the tears streaming down my face, for days.</sentence><sentence id="3344">And the sa -- the -- the sailors kind of took pity on me, and they would bring me an occasional piece of fruit or so -- the food on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was all spoiled.</sentence><sentence id="3345">The only thing that was edible was some of the fruit.</sentence><sentence id="3346">I -- I didn't eat anything except the fruit that they brought.</sentence><sentence id="3347">And meanwhile I wasn't getting any better, so I had to report back to the <span class="BUILDING">dispensary</span> and they would do it again and again.</sentence><sentence id="3348">And I cried so bitterly and pleaded with them to stop doing it, that they finally stopped doing it, but then they did something</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="3352">7 somewhat similar which is -- which is, if you can imagine plaster that is like an emery board on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, is like sandpaper.</sentence><sentence id="3353">And they put this plaster on you with the sandpaper side towards the skin, and then they rip it off in rapid succession.</sentence><sentence id="3354">So you have again, a similar thing going on, but it's just horrendously painful.</sentence><sentence id="3355">At least it wasn't as bad as the cupping.</sentence><sentence id="3356">So partway across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>, one of the engines dies, and then I became sort of aware of the fact there were all these adults on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, because then there was a lot of chaos, and a lot of crying, and a lot of people who were certain we were never going to make it, and I saw how upset these people were.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3357">And I don't think it registered on me what it meant that one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motors</span> died and you couldn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="3358">Well, we did make it over that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and we did get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> there was a dock strike.</sentence><sentence id="3359">So now we're on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, twirling around in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> day after day after day with this dock strike going on, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3360">Q: Are you any better?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3361">A: N -- I must have been because I didn't -- don't remember any more of these treatments, and I remember coming into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and I remember seeing the -- that big neon sign, that horse with -- the winged red horse, I don't know if it was <span class="BUILDING">Texaco</span> or Mobil or s --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3362">Q: <span class="REGION">Texaco</span>, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3363">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Texaco</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="3436">I c -- I couldn't even begin to brainstorm ideas about anything.</sentence><sentence id="3437">And the older I get, the more I understand it, and the more I admire here.</sentence><sentence id="3438">She was not a complicated woman, she was not well educated.</sentence><sentence id="3439">She, as I say, worked for my father in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> as a</sentence><sentence id="3441">00 salesgirl, and they must have somehow kept in touch because even when she was -- m-my sister did indicate that there was -- that they had kept in touch and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3442">I don't know if there was any socializing back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="3443">But that's -- y-you know, I -- I -- why did she do this, did she do it because there was money to be had?</sentence><sentence id="3444">I'm sure that wasn't an issue.</sentence><sentence id="3445">Did she do it -- there may have well passed money, but I'm sure this was

remember the neighbors after the war, I remember that the neighbors who ran the <span class="BUILDING">embroidery store</span> next door were two -- two ladies who seemed -- who then seemed elderly to me, they probably weren't, and -- and they were very religious, and they asked if I would like to go to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic mass</span> with them the following whatever, whatever, and -- and I was a child who really kept away from religion.</sentence><sentence id="3448">Now why?</sentence><sentence id="3449">It's not so easy to say.</sentence><sentence id="3450">People make an easy assumption that it's because of my -- my experiences.</sentence><sentence id="3451">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="3452">Somehow these experiences are in a separate

it.</sentence><sentence id="3454">But -- but I don't think that that was the motivating factor w-w-wh-why would she respond so differently than the other siblings with whom she was raised?</sentence><sentence id="3455">So I think some of that had to do, perhaps, with the personal relationship that she had with my father.</sentence><sentence id="3456">He had been very good to her, I understand, and maybe -- m-maybe that's sort of what I always preach about, which is that when -- when people get to know each other, when people rub elbows together, when you see that -- that, you know, this person is not some stereotypic, stigmatized non -- untouchable kind of person -- I-I don't know, m-maybe she had a crush on my father when she was young.</sentence><sentence id="3457">I -- I -- I have no idea why she did it.</sentence><sentence id="3458">Did she do it as wi -- what you said earlier, that she perhaps wasn't wild about Jews, but this is a Jew she knew personally and

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4024">Q: Were they religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4026">A: N -- Lwouldn't say they were -- I think my aunt was less religious than my uncle.</sentence><sentence id="4027">I think that they believed in the importance of maintaining certain traditions.</sentence><sentence id="4028">They believed in the importance of supporting the Jewish people as a people.</sentence><sentence id="4029">They became founding members of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westport</span>, actually, and helped to -- to -- to set that up.</sentence><sentence id="4030">They insisted that I go to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>, and I guess when I was an absolute, miserable person -- child, when I was little, and -- and given to tantrums, I guess that's the biggest one I ever threw, was when they said I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4031">I instinctively didn't want <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>, I instinctively didn't want part of that, I instinctively rejected any notion of religiosity and religious stuff and all the rest of it, and I probably also rejected any other entrapment for being different again.</sentence><sentence id="4032">I don't know how cognizant I was of that, but I think intuitively I was.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4057">Q: And when you went to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>, was it terrible for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4059">A: Well, it wasn't terrible, it was sort of ineffectual as far as I was concerned, it was, you know, I couldn't sleep late on Sunday and I had to go there, and blah, blah, blah, and I hated it, and I went.</sentence><sentence id="4060">And I got -- I made some friends, and most of the Jewish kids didn't live in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, so any friendships I made were difficult to follow up on because they were in other parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4061">And they themselves were members of the <span class="BUILDING">Conservative Temple</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>, but they felt okay with me going to the <span class="BUILDING">Reformed synagogue</span>, which was interesting.</sentence><sentence id="4062">But when it came to the high holidays, they walked, and they celebrated them, and they wanted me to do likewise, and I was supposed to go to services with them, and walk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temple</span>, and not being a great lover of walking from the days I went through the <span class="DLF">alley</span> at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">wax museum</span>, I always sort of resented that, and I thought that the whole idea was crazy and foolish and you know, it just seemed to me sort of -- and then of course I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on those days, and I didn't like that, and I had to go back and explain why wasn't I in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4063">And those were not the days when you were given to be excused because it was religious absence and stuff, so that was always a pain.</sentence><sentence id="4064">On the other hand, by the time I got to about the eighth grade, I had a very good teacher, and we had some real history, and the history of the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="4065">And I ended up actually valuing that because I did learn something here, and because I always found myself in the position of being the only Jewish kid in a large gathering of non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4066">And so I was always the spokesperson, a not particularly willing] -- willingly, but people put me there.</sentence><sentence id="4067">So I would have to answer questions about what do Jews believe and -- and why did they kill Christ, and all these kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="4068">And it made me rather unhappy, but I felt better having had the</sentence><sentence id="4070">18 class, so that I could in fact answer some questions.</sentence><sentence id="4071">And so actually I stayed on, and stayed in the Confirmation year, which was yet another year, and then I learn even more about what Jews believe and why they do what they do.</sentence><sentence id="4072">And then I was Confirmed and I went on and stayed in -- I-I was -- I sang in the choir in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and then I stayed on and did two more years of what was called post-Confirmation class.</sentence><sentence id="4073">And we did comparative religion, and we did study of the Torah and so forth, wi-with Rabbi Philip Bernstein who'd been a -- a <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> -- chaplain at -- during the second war.</sentence><sentence id="4074">And I think that there was a lot that I began to appreciate about what then became something more meaningful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4093">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4095">A: And as my life continued, it was always in this vein of being, for example, out of 1800 in the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, there were probably 10 or fewer Jewish kids at that particular <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4096">S -- and then I was -- I was very active in the girl scouts, and I was selected to represent <span class="REGION">New York state</span> at a national encampment, and I was back in the same <span class="DLF">pool</span> of, you know, well tell us about Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4097">Now they didn't ask me stuff about the war yet, and -- and -- or -- well, some people did, but I sort of kept that still pretty much closed.</sentence><sentence id="4098">But I did appreciate that, and I -- but I had such a commitment to trying to improve the whole <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> experience for children that I volunteered to teach <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4099">I -- I had this presumptuous sense that I could do it better than these other people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4113">A: Yeah, well was a little bit -- little bit difficult.</sentence><sentence id="4114">I mean, on the first year I was teaching, a -- one of the little kids of -- first or -- <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, first grade or something, came up to me and said,</sentence><sentence id="4116">19 "You know, Mrs. Cohen, I saw God on television last night."</sentence><sentence id="4117">And the -- things like that were a little difficult to cope with, but there was definitely a sense on my part that I felt a -- a -- a-- a reason to be a teacher, to -- to teach kids something, and to not disperse or dispel any notions of God, or the existence of God, which I would never do, but to bring in what is important about religions, and beliefs and values.</sentence><sentence id="4118">Wh- What -- what is there that's really worth fighting for here?And I think that that really was the sort of connecting thread to most of what I did all my life.</sentence><sentence id="4119">Going into education with a strong belief in -- in the value of education for teaching, and for opening up horizons and for having people learn to live with each other and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4120">I was a -- a one world candidate, and in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> I was, you know, preaching -- or not preaching, but I was s-supporting those kinds of organizations.</sentence><sentence id="4121">I remember some very narrow-minded <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teachers with whom I challenged their viewpoints and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4122">I was never afraid to stand up or to speak out, and as turns out, neither are my kids.</sentence><sentence id="4123">But I didn't need to be pigeonholed, and I didn't want to be pigeonholed, and -- a-and it was -- it was -- it was a very much longer time before I began talking about the war, and as I said earlier, I -- I never thought of myself as a survivor.</sentence><sentence id="4124">I thought only those people who had survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, the people -- th-th-the -- the displaced persons, the people who had the numbers carved on their arms.</sentence><sentence id="4125">I didn't have that, and I was alive, and I was -- I was with a family, and I guess I was hidden, but -- so -- and -- and I remember the first time, the very first time that I saw any movie that related to anything having to do with the war.</sentence><sentence id="4126">I-It was -- it -- it packed an enormous emotional wallop, and it was, "The Pawnbroker."</sentence><sentence id="4127">And I don't know if you remember the film.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4232">Q: Did he find out very quickly about your war years, or did it take you a few years to be able to tell him as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4234">A: I think it was more gradual with him.</sentence><sentence id="4235">I think things came out piecemeal over time and discussion and as we grew to know each other more, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4236">And it was a -- after all, it was three years before we were married, but yeah, it -- it -- well, it did not all come at once.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4240">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4242">A: And -- and it was not -- and it was not a public thing, either, it was very much more private.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4244">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="4245">So it doesn't become public for you until the 60's, until these --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4246">A: Exactly.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4247">Q: [indecipherable] first time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4259">Q: Do you now consider yourself a survivor?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4260">A: I do now, and I also realize that more and more of us are gone.</sentence><sentence id="4261">And that er -- that the -- the littlest bit that I can do to bear testimony to this event is probably the only thing I can do to justify that I am among the living, and so many are among the dead.</sentence><sentence id="4262">And if I'm not willing to do that, then I'm really doing a grave disservice, both to humankind and to those who died, because no one was there to speak for them if it's not coming from us.</sentence><sentence id="4263">And the -- the dilemma about not only studying this whole human element to -- to realize -- well, I made mention for example of the -- of "The Eye of the Storm," or the -- the, "Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes," and all of those.</sentence><sentence id="4264">Yes, we can isolate those particular behaviors and we can call them by names and we can study them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4265">Stanley Milgrim, a social psychologist at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> did these studies that are probably more telling about what happened and why people and how people were able to do these terrible things.</sentence><sentence id="4266">If you know the -- I'm -- I'm sure you do, but he -- he basically put somebody in a white coat in a <span class="BUILDING">lab</span> with a one way mirror, and he brought people in off the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and said we're running this experiment.</sentence><sentence id="4267">We're going to see how much pain these -- how much shock these subjects are willing to endure.</sentence><sentence id="4268">And below the one way mirror was a group of actors in a <span class="BUILDING">studio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4269">And there was a fake set of dials and people turned up the electricity.</sentence><sentence id="4270">Up and up and up.</sentence><sentence id="4271">And it didn't matter that the actors were writhing on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and screaming and calling and saying stop, stop.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4272">It apparently did not affect most of the people, not every single one.</sentence><sentence id="4273">And now you couldn't do that kind of experiment any more because of the upset to the people who -- who came to recognize what they were capable of doing.</sentence><sentence id="4274">But if we're capable of doing that, and we keep doing it, and we keep doing it, and we keep turning our backs to what's going on in <span class="REGION">areas</span> where other people are doing it, we're not advancing at all.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4278">24</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4279">Q: So what good is it to talk about, do you think?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4280">A: Well, I think that if there are enough people who hear it, and if there are enough people who are struck by the fact that this kind of behavior can lead to this kind of event, the Holocaust, that maybe it behooves them to do something before we get there.</sentence><sentence id="4281">Maybe.</sentence><sentence id="4282">I -- I think th -- I only -- I have to continue to believe that, because otherwise I can't continue to go on.</sentence><sentence id="4283">And this is also back to what I said earlier about the fact you never know what you're able to sustain, you never know what you are able to do, or what you'd be willing to do in a situation where your life depends on it, or the lifes of your loved ones.</sentence><sentence id="4284">But the bottom line is that we should perhaps not be so adaptable.</sentence><sentence id="4285">We should not be able to do what these Jews did for so long, throughout history, which is to adjust to the behavior that was imposed on them, and the restrictions imposed on them, and the tortures imposed on them.</sentence><sentence id="4286">What can you do?</sentence><sentence id="4287">You can't stand up and fight.</sentence><sentence id="4288">I know that they -- they were helpless, they had no weapons, they had no allies, they had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="4289">So the question about why didn't they stand up and fight becomes a -- a moot question, really.</sentence><sentence id="4290">But when you find yourself in a situation where we really must stop, I don't know why we, as a nation, aren't in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and I consider myself equally guilty, because I don't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="4291">But why are not in the <span class="DLF">street</span> demanding that we stop killing?</sentence><sentence id="4292">How far have we come if we can't sit around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and try to work things out.</sentence><sentence id="4293">Why can't we -- I took training in mediation.</sentence><sentence id="4294">Much of my work has been in -- in law in education, and first amendment rights.</sentence><sentence id="4295">And those liberties and freedoms that we have fought for in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, since time immemorial as far as the history of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, why are we suddenly making different rules for different people?</sentence><sentence id="4296">I -- I don't know how to adjust to that, it -- it -- it's -- I think when people used to ask me, you know, do you wa -- well, how do you feel about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and so forth, and I always had felt this is the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where people can talk, where people can argue, where you can have a</sentence><sentence id="4298">25 dialog, where we have an open press.</sentence><sentence id="4299">And yet things keep coming out, and keep coming out and keep coming out.</sentence><sentence id="4300">In the papers every day, in the -- the general news.</sentence><sentence id="4301">I don't have access to any private news any more than anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="4302">But finally it's getting to people in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> that this president lied to us, and for whatever personal reasons went to war, killing not only Americans, but also Iraqis, or Afghanis, and the -- and the justification for af -- <span class="COUNTRY">Afghanistan</span>, I think, is certainly greater than <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4303">But there were no weapons of mass destruction.</sentence><sentence id="4304">Why do we support a world organization?</sentence><sentence id="4305">Why do we say other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> have to adhere to the decisions of the world organization, but we're outside the law.</sentence><sentence id="4306">This doesn't make any sense.</sentence><sentence id="4307">That doesn't move us forward.</sentence><sentence id="4308">It doesn't put us in the situation of -- of making unacceptable certain ways of warfare and torture and behavior.</sentence><sentence id="4309">We -- we ti -- we say Amnesty International is wrong.</sentence><sentence id="4310">They come in -- the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> is bamboozled, just as they were by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="4311">The Nazis came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> into some of those camps, and there is data that I have just seen this spring, actually, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoover</span>, indicating what the men were told, what the soldiers were told, in order to dress up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp so</span> that the Red Cross could come in and be impressed.</sentence><sentence id="4312">How they had casual music groups, how they had <span class="BUILDING">cafes</span> set up, they shipped half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> population off to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they -- the -- otherwise the Red Cross would say you have too many people per square <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4313">Well, such as you might call it.</sentence><sentence id="4314">It's unbelievable what these people did.</sentence><sentence id="4315">And here, first person accounts that I am now finding in the original languages about what the Nazis did in order to bamboozle the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="4316">But we are in similar situations, uncomfortably similar situations.</sentence><sentence id="4317">And I can't live with this, I am finding this nightmarish.</sentence><sentence id="4318">My daughter and I talk on the phone and we're either in tears, or we're so upset every phone call that I finally said to her, we've got to put this off limits, we can't do this.</sentence><sentence id="4319">I c -- I can't -- I can't do this.</sentence><sentence id="4320">But I am -- lam just as bad as everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="4321">I haven't done anything except signing petitions and trying to get</sentence><sentence id="4323">26 people to listen and read.</sentence><sentence id="4324">But I haven't gone off in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and demonstrated.</sentence><sentence id="4325">I ha -- I don't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="4326">And of course this -- this public relations campaign about making every difference of opinion seem like an unpatriotic act has a very familiar ring to me.</sentence><sentence id="4327">I heard this before.</sentence><sentence id="4328">And there -- here we are celebrating 60 years til the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="4329">Where are we now?That was the war to end all wars.</sentence><sentence id="4330">So it tastes very bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4387">Q: The taste for you after the war, is a very bad one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4389">A: Well, it's only bad because as I say, this -- this was -- this was our hope for the future.</sentence><sentence id="4390">We were not going to as a world, let this kind of thing happen again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4393">Q: But that's not true.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4395">A: And I don't see it as true, and I s-see such -- so many similar means.</sentence><sentence id="4396">Yes, not all.</sentence><sentence id="4397">You know, there -- there aren't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span>, but we're doing many of the things in very similar ways, that have to me a ring of danger.</sentence><sentence id="4398">And I never thought that I would feel this way in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because -- and this is why I'm such a strong believer in an absolutely free and independent press.</sentence><sentence id="4399">Because the press is the -- is the -- the only guide we have through darkness.</sentence><sentence id="4400">And we depend on the press to lead us there so that we can ask the question and say to the administration, how can you explain this?</sentence><sentence id="4401">How can you explain that?</sentence><sentence id="4402">And as long as there is light on the subject, then you can stop it.</sentence><sentence id="4403">But if you force people underground, you don't know what in God's name they're doing underground.</sentence><sentence id="4404">You don't know what the <span class="BUILDING">Ku Klux Klan</span> is doing, what the neo-Nazis are doing, what the terrorists are doing if you force them underground.</sentence><sentence id="4405">And if you -- if you contain the press and -- and sever its freedom, and -- or make it shut up and make it become an arm of the government PR, then you can no longer trust the press to do that for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4421">27</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4422">A: I'm not sure if you were particularly interested in this last, but this is why I'm feeling so -- I -- I don't know what to do with my feelings about this.</sentence><sentence id="4423">And -- and yet my commitment all through my professional life has been to support Constitutional liberties, the Bill of Rights, to teach my students, both elementary teachers and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students, the importance of listening and respecting the opinions of the children in their classes, whether they abide by them or not.</sentence><sentence id="4424">But that the essence of a free society is to listen and respect.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4428">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4430">A: And you stop your respect at a certain point of course, if that other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is preaching your death, or somebody else's death, then you say, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="4431">I don't have any compunction about saying at a certain point that you have to restrain that freedom if that person or group is preaching that doctrine that certain people should be killed.</sentence><sentence id="4432">But ne-nearly up to that point, I'm saying you -- this -- this is the only guide we have to remain a -- a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with the ideals that presumably we have led the world in and -- and have tried to teach others.</sentence><sentence id="4433">I mean, what good is it to talk about democracy and then go in and behave the way we're doing and besides which there's another piece of this teaching democracy, which right now I don't think this administration has -- has reckoned with, and that is that if you really preach democracy, you may end up getting an election someplace with people that you don't really want.</sentence><sentence id="4434">But if you believe in democracy, if that's what those people want, that's -- you have to respect that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4440">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4442">A: But we -- we're not ready for that.</sentence><sentence id="4443">Can't deal with that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4473">Q: I'm going to ask you given what you -- what you've just been talking about and talk about at various points in the interview, about what's going on, what -- how you see the world now, you talk particularly a-about this administration, but of course in your lifetime, there was <span class="COUNTRY">Cambodia</span>, there was <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4474">A: Absolutely.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4475">Q: -- there was <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span>, and ti -- <span class="REGION">East Timor</span>, and now Darfore, I mean it goes on and on.</sentence><sentence id="4476">When you think about it, do you think more about Tante Toos and what she did?</sentence><sentence id="4477">That she took a very particular kind of action.</sentence><sentence id="4478">She didn't save the world, but she engaged in such a way that she risked her life, and her family's life to try to save three people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4483">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4485">Q: I mean does -- does -- do you think more about how d -- how difficult it must have been?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4487">A: No --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4490">29</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4491">Q: Nobody knocked on your <span class="DLF">door</span> yet --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4492">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4494">Q: -- to say take me in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4496">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="4497">No, there's -- there's no question about that, I -- I do think about that enormously.</sentence><sentence id="4498">I -- I think all the ti -- and -- and also actually all the years that I was getting older and so forth, I kept thinking about what it must have been like for my mother -- when I was 45 or something.</sentence><sentence id="4499">You know, I would think, oh my God, my mother was such and such and age, and this is what was happening, and what would I do, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4500">And I was also -- and I think I had very strong, not only values, but ideas, and also at the same time, I think, wanted very much for my children to have as normal -- whatever that really means, but as normal a childhood as possible.</sentence><sentence id="4501">And so I -- I know I'm veering off your question a little bit, but I felt on the one hand that they needed to learn what I could express about this from a learning point of view.</sentence><sentence id="4502">So we did very little by way of Jewish tradition in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, partly because I didn't like the pulling apart of some members of the Jewish community and I didn't like the sort of exclusiveness that one particular rabbi had -- had communicated.</sentence><sentence id="4503">So we didn't really want our kids exposed to that, so ours was by contrast a much more inclusive <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and there was -- it wa -- it's really interesting because l-Leas, my daughter has often said, you know, this community, or that community, or this group of people is -- is really the example of the kind of values that you and Dad taught us.</sentence><sentence id="4504">And so clearly there was a -- a -- a very clear understanding of what those values were.</sentence><sentence id="4505">And so we neither the kids likes this exclusiveness that some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> will -- will -- will send out, will radiate.</sentence><sentence id="4506">And at the same time, I didn't want them to have the burden that so many children of survivors seem to carry.</sentence><sentence id="4507">And I got to know about that, because as I was speaking around, so many of the people came to me and said, oh now I understand what my parents didn't want to</sentence><sentence id="4509">30 tell me, or now I understand why it's so difficult to talk about the second World War, or whatever, whatever, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4510">And likewise in Europe, where I've spoken in a number of <span class="NPIP">places</span>, including <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teachers, who said, we cannot speak to our parents, they will not answer questions, they will not tell us where they were, and so on, or what they did.</sentence><sentence id="4511">And at the same time I see that this presents a special kind of burden, and I didn't want to have our kids have that.</sentence><sentence id="4512">Now this commitment to normalcy, is that sort of -- that's probably not that unusual, I imagine any parent wants only the happiest and the best f-for their kids, and it's not always the happy situations that build character, necessarily, but at the same time I made sure that the kids had a sense of -- of inclusiveness, of one world ideas about respect for other people.</sentence><sentence id="4513">So much so that the kids were actually quite -- took on an activist role in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on behalf of other kids.</sentence><sentence id="4514">Not Jewish kids, necessarily, but I -- you know, speaking up on behalf of someone that the teacher was picking on.</sentence><sentence id="4515">The teacher probably didn't even know he was doing it, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4516">And then also, I think, reflecting on the present role of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, vis-a-vis the Palestinians, taking classes in Israeli-Arab dispute.</sentence><sentence id="4517">Trying to be informed and to not be afraid to express an opinion in opposition to the Israeli government.</sentence><sentence id="4518">Sometimes putting themselves at -- on the outs with other Jews, perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="4519">But I felt that that was terribly, terribly important.</sentence><sentence id="4520">Now the same goes for putting yourself out for some of these people.</sentence><sentence id="4521">And so far, I have not been able to do that in a personal sense -- back to your original question, other than in the monetary sense.</sentence><sentence id="4522">And w-we have as a family, and as -- and my husband and I personally, have made big commitments to IRC, the International Rescue Committee, which seems in a major way to be helping refugees without any respect to what their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or their nationa -- their nationality or their religion is, but going to those <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the world where people are desperate, where people are suffering because of what's going on, whether it's internal or external strife, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4523">So we have done as much as</sentence><sentence id="4525">31 we could, maybe not as much as we can do, but still hope to be able to continue to do, in those terms, which -- which are important.</sentence><sentence id="4526">And my husband, especially, I think in a professional way, has brought the plight of the refugees to students, involved students in the work that's necessary to save these people around the world.</sentence><sentence id="4527">To do even small things, like volunteer to teach English as a second language in the <span class="BUILDING">local church</span> or <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, wherever the classes are being held.</sentence><sentence id="4528">To -- one of -- one of -- wo -- actually she wasn't a student of mine at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampshire</span>, but a -- a na -- a student, who became a student of Peter's, and worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span> and extended herself to the point of taking a small inheritance that she had from her grandmother, and bringing three Cambodian women back, who had been raped and tortured and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4529">And adopting them, bringing them back, getting them settled, getting them set up.</sentence><sentence id="4530">Yeah, we're not saving the world, but we are trying, and -- and I think sometimes when I have this great urgent sense of why am I sitting here in a <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span>, I think, well, somebody has to sit in the classroom and try to keep part of the mission going that -- that we have got to change, and how do we do that.</sentence><sentence id="4531">And that not everybody can run in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, and do the medical stuff, or do the actual whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4532">And somehow I've often felt that in my small way, given the values that I think I've been able to communicate, even at the level of simply teaching teachers to have respect for the child, which sounds as if it should be nothing anyone would argue about.</sentence><sentence id="4533">But if you watch clearly, you see that not every adult, and not every person who's teaching, has that respect for that child.</sentence><sentence id="4534">Even if they are <span class="BUILDING">church</span>-going and religion loving, and anti-abortion and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4535">Respect for that other life, and the fact that that life has a will and some sense and justification for some freedom is not there a -- often, in spite of the espousal of these other, so-called values.</sentence><sentence id="4536">So I feel sometimes that maybe this is a rationalization, but it is something I do believe I could do, and I could do it quite well.</sentence><sentence id="4537">And so I felt that to throw in the towel was not the right thing for me to do, at least at tho --</sentence><sentence id="4539">32 in those years of my life.</sentence><sentence id="4540">I would like very much to be out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> now, and -- and now is probably not a good time, having since had cancer and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="4541">And I have to say that when I was first diagnosed with the cancer, a friend of mine said, oh Hedy, you're a survivor, you're going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="4542">And I have to say, although I understood perfectly where she was coming from, I quietly said to myself, why do I have to keep proving it all the time?</sentence><sentence id="4543">But I -- I feel now somewhat medically compromised about going out in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, but it is something that I thought
