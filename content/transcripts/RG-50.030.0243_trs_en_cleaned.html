two kind of partisans, the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1429">There were partisans they organized, natives, whoever wanted but the Ukrainians were against the Russians, so they didn't have much

and they they...Russian always was like <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, fighting to the last Eng...to the last Indian soldier.</sentence><sentence id="1435">The Russians did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1436">They sent them out because it was a very dangerous mission, to send out the Spanish Communists.</sentence><sentence id="1437">Again, they didn't want them in <span

my life, you know, but that's the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1440">That was Spanish...very fine, very fine people, very...very...they were not the average Russian partisan, the average soldier.</sentence><sentence id="1441">Each one was with a personality.</sentence><sentence id="1442">We met some Ukrainian...some partisans and they told us sorry, we don't take.</sentence><sentence id="1443">What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="1444">See, without without ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="1445">We said how we get ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="1446">Go take a stick and kill a German, take his gun or his rifle and come to us.</sentence><sentence id="1447">Then you'll fight.</sentence><sentence id="1448">It's easier said than to do because the Germans were twelve feet

id="1451">II stayed away as far as I can from a German and they told us to take a stick and killa German.</sentence><sentence id="1452">Again, the same story.</sentence><sentence id="1453">Everybody was .</sentence><sentence id="1454">So we decided, four of us, four or five young boys...there's only way</sentence><sentence id="1456">8 how to get to the partisans, cause we knew we can't survive.</sentence><sentence id="1457">We didn't know when it's going to end and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1458">It was forty below zero with no

id="1476">We're going to send you back and we made up, if they told us they send back, what we have to say.</sentence><sentence id="1477">We have to say two things we agreed.</sentence><sentence id="1478">We want to be killed by a Russian bullet, not by German.</sentence><sentence id="1479">That was appeal (ph) to the Russians, and if they...if we'll see they don't want to take us, they should be aware that if the Germans catch us, we don't...we're not responsible what we're going to say.</sentence><sentence id="1480">We had to use threat.</sentence><sentence id="1481">To use threat

something...they will they will force us, you know, to to say where they are.</sentence><sentence id="1602">So the Germans were not close, but they were afraid to go in because they didn't know how
