<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family and your life before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="14">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="15">My father, whose name was -- was Adolf, nothing -- no relation to the notorious Adolf, wa-was a businessman, he had inherited a grain export business from his father.</sentence><sentence id="16">And in addition to that he had a -- a partnership in a <span class="BUILDING">grain mill</span>, and for awhile he also had leased a number of <span class="BUILDING">movie theaters</span>, which was very nice for us because we could go to the movies for free.</sentence><sentence id="17">And he -- h-he was fairly wealthy, but the depression affected his business a lot and the income went way down and we found it necessary to move into a much smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, actually in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="18">And so we had to live on a very limited budget for a number of years during the depression years.</sentence><sentence id="19">My mother was a v -- a very attractive woman.</sentence><sentence id="20">Her parents had -- well, her f-father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, her mother actually came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.648" long="23.714">Mitau</span>, which was the capital of the former Duchy of Courland, and her family, I think, had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> for quite a few generations.</sentence><sentence id="21">My mother was the youngest of three daughters, had -- they also had a son.</sentence><sentence id="22">Her father, again, was fairly prosperous before World War I, but then, with the German troops advancing into <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, decided to flee to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Petersburg</span>, and somehow during the war and revolution, managed to lose all his money, so he came back almost penniless, and somehow the -- the family never recovered, th-they lived rather modestly.</sentence><sentence id="23">Okay, about my childhood, yes,</sentence><sentence id="25">in the early years, we lived in a -- in a comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, my brother and I each had a -- a governess, and as -- which was the custom in those days.</sentence><sentence id="26">Our family was somewhat Germanized, like many of the e-educated Jews in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Courland</span> and sort of <span class="REGION">western Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">My parents had gone to <span class="BUILDING">Russian schools</span> so they would often speak Russian to one another when they didn't want us children to understand.</sentence><sentence id="28">But the rest of time we all spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="29">And I never learned to speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="30">My father could, my -- my mother could also speak it, but not quite as fluently.</sentence><sentence id="31">And we -- my -- my brother was t -- his name was George, was two years old than I. My father was rather partial to his oldest son, which of -- in the early years was a bit of a problem for me, but in -- eventually, I think shortly before he died, he began to treat us equally.</sentence><sentence id="32">Okay, maybe you can ask me another question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Did -- was your family religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: My mother was fairly religious.</sentence><sentence id="58">We certainly observed the major holidays, usually went to our grandparents or had a Seder in our own <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">Usually at the grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="60">My father, for some reason, had quit the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish temple</span>, it -- it doesn't mean that he totally abandoned the religion, there -- I think there were some quasi-political differences.</sentence><sentence id="61">My paternal grandfather actually was a -- a gabbai of the local <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> was apparently a highly regarded member of the congregation.</sentence><sentence id="62">And then when -- as -- as I approached the Bar Mitzvah -- both my brother and I had Bar Mitzvah and for me that's -- marked the beginning of a religious period, and I was -- was very religious, said all the prayers and did all the right things and so on.</sentence><sentence id="63">That process was s - - SS -- stopped by the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liepaja</span> like?</sentence><sentence id="72">Was it -- was it a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>?</sentence><sentence id="73">Were you involved with it?</sentence><sentence id="74">Did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: No, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> was relatively large, it was about 12 percent of the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, maybe se -- 7,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="83">I was v -- during my religious phase I certainly went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> on ho -- high holidays and possibly some of the lesser holidays.</sentence><sentence id="84">We also celebrated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Succos</span>, for example, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Purim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">But I was too young to be involved in the religious life and my father simply wouldn't participate in it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of if your friends were Jewish, if your friends were mixed, did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, and that sort of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: I -- the first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I went to was a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">The -- at that time -- it was 1931, I think, the street signs in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> were still in three languages, Latvian, German and Russian and German was still -- a-and both German and Russian were still considered acceptable languages, although the Latvian government emphasi -- tried to emphasize Latvian.</sentence><sentence id="93">We went to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>, and then [indecipherable] I stayed there until spring of "32.</sentence><sentence id="94">Hitler had not yet come to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but it was clearly -- he was on the rise, and there was a perception that anti-Semitism was going to get worse in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and in the German community, so my parents decided to take me out of there.</sentence><sentence id="95">They also decided to put me in a <span class="BUILDING">Latvian public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">I understand that only about 10 percent of the Jewish children went to <span class="BUILDING">Latvian schools</span>, the others went to -- to na - - Jewish schools.</sentence><sentence id="97">I was quite aloof, found it difficult to make friends.</sentence><sentence id="98">I never had more than two close friends.</sentence><sentence id="99">Often they were -- were Latvian, because there were relatively few Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I'm not sure I would have given them preference anyway.</sentence><sentence id="100">But in -- especially in -- in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> my -- the last two years that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, my -- my best friend actually was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="101">I should say something about him, per-perhaps later on.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: Did you have a lot of contact with non-Jewish Latvians, your neighbors, or -- I mean, did --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Yes, usually I had some Latvian friends and since I had very few friends, they generally were the close friends.</sentence><sentence id="108">So I did have a fair amount of contact with them.</sentence><sentence id="109">The neighbors again, I don't think we had any Jewish neighbors in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, or perhaps there were some next <span class="DLF">door</span>, but I -- I don't remember any.</sentence><sentence id="110">So we had contact mainly with -- with Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="111">But my father, of course, had a lot of business contacts with the local Jewish community and my wife -- my -- not my wife, my mother had s-some Jewish friends as well as a number of -- of Gentile friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism as this point in your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: ["ve sort of been giving myself a push lately to think about it and try to remember it.</sentence><sentence id="120">And the worst thing that I can remember happened to me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, all the years that I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Latvian school</span>, is that a few times one of the other boys would f-fold a piece of cloth so it remember -- resemb -- remem -- sorry, resembled a pig's ear and sort of pointed it at me as if to taunt me that I was a Jew and we were not allowed to -- to eat pork.</sentence><sentence id="121">And that was the worst thing that ever happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="122">I don't recall ever being called bad names, or getting into fights because I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="123">Children generally are -- tend to be fairly cruel and s-s -- I'm s -- tend to torment minorities, but I experienced very little of that.</sentence><sentence id="124">And my general perception was, a-again, in part triggered by Ezergailis" book, who tries to show that <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> wasn't any more anti-Semitic than other <span class="REGION">European countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">Frankly, from all the details I remember, I must give him right.</sentence><sentence id="126">And one of the anti-Semitic actions I do remember is that my father's <span class="BUILDING">grain mill</span> was nationalized with inadequate compensation, and I thought this was of an anti-Jewish act.</sentence><sentence id="127">Ezergailis points out that actually a number of non-Jewish businesses were also nationalized, and the intent was not so much to drive the Jews out of business, because in some branches the Jews were left unmolested.</sentence><sentence id="128">It's just that the government, which patterned itself Mussolini's <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, wanted to sort of nati -- to get state ownership of certain branches of business and industry.</sentence><sentence id="129">And if there happened to be</sentence><sentence id="131">some <span class="BUILDING">Jewish companies</span> in the way, they were nationalized.</sentence><sentence id="132">And in other <span class="REGION">areas</span>, where they didn't seem to care at -- at the time, they left the Jews alone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Youw're talking about the Latvian government?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: The Latvian government, yes, yes, we're still in this, the pre-war era.</sentence><sentence id="152">So the anti-Semitism definitely was -- was not bad, and I think another fact is, of course that a number of German Jewish refugees came to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and established themselves and felt reasonably comfortable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: They came because of Hitler?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Okay, so you had a fair amount of knowledge about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: -- prior to his occupation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: We were quite well informed.</sentence><sentence id="164">We would regularly listen to -- to the BBC, to German broadcasts and we -- as long as it was possible we subscribed to a Swiss political weekly that wa -- called the [indecipherable], which at that time was quite famous for being anti-Nazi, and the editor-in-chief was very outspoken and very critical of Hitler and we sort of enjoyed reading his editorials just because he would mince no words.</sentence><sentence id="165">And I thought we were quite well informed, until 19 -- June 1940 when of course the -- the s -- Soviets took over <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and cut off the supply of foreign newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="166">We also subscribed to some German magazines.</sentence><sentence id="167">So I think we were well informed, but we heard only a few sporadic reports about atrocities, even after the outbreak of the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and the famous [indecipherable] Kristallnacht, and of course that was supposed to be in retaliation for the assassination of a German diplomat, and we did hear there were excesses.</sentence><sentence id="168">But we didn't realize how many killings there had been, we heard about property damage and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="169">And we thought, well this is sort of an isolated incident, it's a</sentence><sentence id="171">shame that it happened.</sentence><sentence id="172">But somehow we weren't prepared to change my family's and many other Jew's perception of ger -- of the Germans being basically fair.</sentence><sentence id="173">Maybe they were very strict with Jews, they were depriving them of some civil rights, but we thought that by and large there was -- you pretty much got what you deserved.</sentence><sentence id="174">We thought that they would be discriminating in their treatment of -- of Jews, Jews who in their eyes had conducted themselves badly, or had harmed German interests would of -- would of course be persecuted, and Jews that had been -- had not done so would presumably be judged on their merits.</sentence><sentence id="175">Th-That -- that was the notion we had, and I think there is perhaps another indication of that, that when the w -- the war broke out, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, only about a quarter of the Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> fled with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="176">In my family, out of 27 people, only two fled.</sentence><sentence id="177">The o -- the others all stayed, which means they felt that th-the Germans were the lesser evil.</sentence><sentence id="178">So we -- there was just a further factor, namely the Latvian government was trying to keep good relations with both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and this means that they purposely suppressed any kind of derogatory, unfavorable news about th-the Germans an-and the Russians, so we didn't learn as much about some of the atrocities were going on in -- say in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, a-as we should have.</sentence><sentence id="179">And -- but BBC again didn't report anything, so we -- we had the impression that there were just some small scale atrocities, but nothing major, and sort of isolated.</sentence><sentence id="180">And furthermore, the final solution had not yet started, because there certainly wasn't -- th-the systematic large scale killing of Jews only started with the attack on <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: You started to mention the Russian occupation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="202">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: Why don't you talk a little bit about that, your memories of what happened when the Russians came in, whether there was support for the Russians, whether there was local resistance, and what -- and how that changed your life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Well, the first encounter with the Russians came on October "39, when under the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact, they demanded military bases from the Latvian government, including a large base in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, which had been the principle naval port of the Tsarist empire.</sentence><sentence id="213">In fact, the Russian navy that -- th-the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleet</span> that sailed around -- halfway around the world to fight the Japanese in the Russian Japanese war of 1904 started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">So, they had a large -- established a large <span class="BUILDING">Russian garrison</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was full of Russian soldiers, and in the f -- as a kid, at first it's a little exciting to see all these strange uniforms and so on, but we soon learned that these were really quite unwelcome people.</sentence><sentence id="215">The population I -- I had a summer job at the time and -- at a <span class="BUILDING">carpenter's shop</span>, and some of the workers were rather pleased, they were -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> was a somewhat leftist town and the workers, well [indecipherable] sort of glad that they now the -- the workers are going to own everything, and the government will -- will take from the rich and give to the poor and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="216">So a number of them were sympathetic.</sentence><sentence id="217">I met some of these same workers months later and they were furious because they realized that all these promises had been broken with -- they were -- for example, there were signs up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span>, just, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> now belong to you.</sentence><sentence id="218">Well <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, you still had to pay.</sentence><sentence id="219">And all -- all the other things, practically everything in the economy had changed for the worse and all these promises simply had not been delivered.</sentence><sentence id="220">And a large part of the reason for that was that <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> was part of Europe and had a much higher living standard than <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">And so when it was annexed to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, they had to level everything.</sentence><sentence id="222">And the way they did it is they raised prices to s -- to Soviet levels and they raised -- which in some cases was 10 to 30 fold, and they raised wages maybe</sentence><sentence id="224">double or so, but in -- in -- the net effect was still that the purchasing power, it was very much less.</sentence><sentence id="225">And in turns -- for the Russian soldiers this was still <span class="NPIP">paradise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">They would sort of -- crowded the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and buy everything they c -- they saw for their rubles.</sentence><sentence id="227">So the disenchantment set in very quickly with many people, but there still was a hard core of Latvians, and I wou -- must -- must say also, a number of Jews who in the past had leftist political sympathies, either social democrats, who were, of course, banned at the time, or -- and were the enemies of both the Latvian government and the communists, or communists.</sentence><sentence id="228">Those people were glad they s -- their excuse was well maybe things are not working perfectly, cause we're building a New World order and -- and creating a new type of man, Soviet man and everything is going to be alright and it's going to be much better than you could ever dream of.</sentence><sentence id="229">So these people were still true believers, but a lot of people were disenchanted.</sentence><sentence id="230">And certainly we were, because we were the bourgeois, as they would call them, we were s-suddenly the enemies of -- class enemies.</sentence><sentence id="231">The Russians expropriated my father's business.</sentence><sentence id="232">He was a-allowed to keep his debts, but he -- all the assets were taken away from him.</sentence><sentence id="233">And in general there were lots of restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="234">For instance, they decreed that every person was entitled to only nine square meters of <span class="INT_SPACE">living space</span>, with some sort of allowances for -- which means most people had to -- to sublet -- to rent <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">And there were some allowances made if -- if you rented or -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was accessible only through another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, then this other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> didn't count fully, you could still keep that because you lost your privacy, your roomer would always walk through that other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">So we were forced to rent our -- a couple of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">And as it turned out th -- these were two people from the border guards, which was a branch of the Russian security apparatus that was not identical to but closely allied to the KGB, and they were later involved in deportation.</sentence><sentence id="238">One of the men was -- was actually a Jew, Kleinman, and he moved out after</sentence><sentence id="240">awhile.</sentence><sentence id="241">And the other one was a -- an ethnic Russian from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">Sort of a young, rather innocuous looking man who sort of rent the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and was just w-wearing civilian clothes and then one day instead of opening the <span class="DLF">door</span> with his key, about a month or two later he rang the doorbell, and my mother opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she saw this large man in a Russian major's uniform and at first she didn't recognize him, she was scared.</sentence><sentence id="243">He was proudly showing off his new uniform.</sentence><sentence id="244">Well, he is actually the man who saved us from deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">What happened is that a week before the outbreak of the German Russian war, the Russians went to a number of <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in the middle of the night, sort of got the people out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, told them get dressed, pack your -- your bags, and come with us, get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">And the next morning we found out that a lot of wealthy families, including a fair number of Jews had been deported.</sentence><sentence id="247">And so we thought, well, by <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and so on, by our status, we were very likely to be included, and before long there was a phone call saying don't leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, pack your bags and wait, we" ll come for you.</sentence><sentence id="248">So we -- we packed, we did as we were told, and of course we weren't at all happy about the prospect, and then we realized that our roomer had not come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night, he was out rounding up people, he was one of the leaders in this aktion.</sentence><sentence id="249">So when he finally came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my mother went to see him and asked if he could take us off the list.</sentence><sentence id="250">And he sort of joked and teased first, well don't you want to go to a sa -- to a great s -- Socialist Motherland, or whatever he called it, and my mother answered diplomatically, well it's interesting [indecipherable] we're quite happy here, we'd rather stay here.</sentence><sentence id="251">And so he did manage to take us off the list and so for the moment we were saved.</sentence><sentence id="252">But this, of course, this event, this mass deportation is what -- as the Germans subsequently exploited a lot to arouse population against the Jews, but I presume we" ll come to that a little later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: So during the Russian occupation, economic -- economically, it was disastrous.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: What about were you able to continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, religious practices, wha -- did any of that change?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: At my level religious practices were not affected.</sentence><sentence id="308">I don't know whether any pressure was put on the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish congregations</span>, but I wasn't aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="309"><span class="BUILDING">School</span>, I was still allowed to stay, but certainly I was of -- invisibly marked in the eyes of my fellow students, I was a bourgeois.</sentence><sentence id="310">And w-we -- | had a compulsory political education class, and of course there were tirades against the bourgeoisie, Marxism, Leninism, all this garbage.</sentence><sentence id="311">But this didn't really affect the way my fellow classmates treated me.</sentence><sentence id="312">They sensed that -- well, they were for the most part unhappy with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="313">We had one real communist in class, and the others were unhappy to varying degrees, and they realized that I was unhappy too, so we -- we made common cause, there was no tension, they didn't hold me responsible as a Jew f-for the communist occupation and so on.</sentence><sentence id="314">It -- it didn't really affect me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: How long did this last?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Almost exactly one year.</sentence><sentence id="326">They marched into -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> fanned out from there and crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> in June of 1940, and then i -- i -- a year later almost to the day came these deportations and another week later the Germans attacked.</sentence><sentence id="327">M-Maybe I sh -- I should mention a little bit about these -- these days.</sentence><sentence id="328">I ha-had a summer job in the <span class="BUILDING">city construction office</span>, a-and on -- one day before the German attack, I-I was working on some project, and I was told the morning by my boss, stop whatever you're doing, we have something very urgent and -- and I and some of the other apprentices who were working there, were -- were told then to run off as many copies as we could of some drawings for sort of <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span>, that were actually really <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, very primitive, like the <span class="DLF">fallout shelters</span> that were built in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S</span>.. And a-all day there was a sort of</sentence><sentence id="330">1 hustle and bustle with people coming and going and picking up copies.</sentence><sentence id="331">So apparently -- I realized the next morning when the -- we heard about the attacks on -- on the radio, I realized why I was made to work late that day and why we suddenly worked on these air raid shelter plans.</sentence><sentence id="332">That apparently the Russian sort of military leadership had gotten wind of the German attack because the Germans had, after all, massed three and a half million troops along the <span class="DLF">border</span>, and there were a number of -- even some German deserters who crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and warned them of the attack and they'd been warned from other <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">Stalin didn't want to believe any of this.</sentence><sentence id="334">His -- but his generals [indecipherable] tried to see him a week before the attack and warn him, they decided to go ahead on their own and -- and do -- make at least minimum preparations without telling him.</sentence><sentence id="335">But still, they were totally surprised.</sentence><sentence id="336">And then when -- when the war started [indecipherable] we were really elated, we heard on the radio that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, we felt this was the lesser evil.</sentence><sentence id="337">We certainly had not sympathized with the Germans when it -- i-in their war against the west.</sentence><sentence id="338">There we certainly preferred the western allies, but we really disliked the Soviet regime intensely, not only because they had nationalized my father's business, but also because of the terror, th-the lies, the hypocrisy, the deceit.</sentence><sentence id="339">And I should say a word about the terror.</sentence><sentence id="340">One of the things that happened is they took over some of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as their <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="341">Police, KGB, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="342">One of the first things that happened is the <span class="DLF">windows</span> on -- on the <span class="DLF">basement level windows</span> were bricked in.</sentence><sentence id="343">These a-afterwards became <span class="INT_SPACE">torture chambers</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">execution chambers</span> and we suspected so much right away.</sentence><sentence id="344">And previously the Latvian police didn't engage in torture, they didn't have any need for this, and it just looked suspicious that suddenly the <span class="DLF">basement windows</span> were -- were sealed off.</sentence><sentence id="345">So there were a number of things.</sentence><sentence id="346">One heard rumors from time to time about people</sentence><sentence id="348">2 disappearing, and of course these -- these rumors then very soon became reality during these mass deportations the week before the start of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: I'm going to stop you here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="378">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mm-hm</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="379">tape break]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="380">Q: Would you continue?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="382">I understand that according to German plans they were supposed to -- to occupy my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> the second day of the war because it was only 70 kilometers away from the <span class="DLF">German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">It actually took them a week, and there was considerably more resistance than they expected, both from -- from German troops, and then apparently from Latvian volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="384">As I said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> was a rather pink <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and a number of the workers and communist youth and so on got weapons and they tried to defend the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">So as a result we got considerably more bombing and shelling than we normally would have had, and especially the last night, there was almost nonstop bombing and a-artillery bombardment and in particular was rather heavy artillery coming from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">And so the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was pretty much in ruins, burned down.</sentence><sentence id="387">The standard lie that was s-spread immediately after th-the German occupation is the Jews burned down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">They say -- they claimed in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">In my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> I can very definitely say this was a -- a -- a totally untenable lie because the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that had burned down were -- were very badly damaged.</sentence><sentence id="390">They were -- had been hit by bombs and by artillery shells, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> had collapsed and so on.</sentence><sentence id="391">A burned out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> normally is burned out, it's blackened by soot, everything combustible is gone, the <span class="DLF">roof</span> may be gone, but the <span class="DLF">walls</span> are still standing.</sentence><sentence id="392">So this was in -- in the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> this was demonstrably a lie.</sentence><sentence id="393">Then the f-first few days with German occupation [indecipherable] nothing much happened, but the real jolt came, I think on July 5%, when suddenly there appeared signs of -- notices everywhere on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, regulations for Jews,</sentence><sentence id="395">3 and there were a list of eight or nine things that Jews were supposed to do or not to do.</sentence><sentence id="396">I mean, obvious ones like turning in weapons, not so obvious ones as turning in all means of transportation, including <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="397">Then th -- they were not -- they were supposed to | -- to lee -- to step from the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> whenever they saw a German soldier approaching, have to -- to -- to pay their respect.</sentence><sentence id="398">They were allowed to leave their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> only a couple of hours in the morning, couple hours in the afternoon, they were supposed to shop only two hours in -- in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="399">The men were -- were supposed to report to work at seven a.m. in -- every morning, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="400">It looked Draconian but not disastrous.</sentence><sentence id="401">We had sort of expected we'd lose some of our civil rights, but certainly we had not expected any danger to our li-lives.</sentence><sentence id="402">And so re-re-reading these -- the -- these regulations I've -- recently I felt that they weren't all that threatening.</sentence><sentence id="403">They were Draconian, but they were not threatening, yet my father was quite concerned, and in retrospect | -- I think what -- what happened is the following.</sentence><sentence id="404">A few days after the Germans marched in, there was a massacre of some 200 to 300 Jews in one of the <span class="DLF">parks</span>, in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="405">Thad not known about this until about two months ago when I read about it in Ezergailis's book.</sentence><sentence id="406">This was -- in that <span class="DLF">park</span> some <span class="DLF">trenches</span> had been dug, presumably the -- the Russian and Latvian defenders expected to fight s -- s -- s -- block by block, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="407">And German army units -- the SD had not yet established itself -- well, apparently killed several hundred Jews and just dumped the corpses in these <span class="DLF">trenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">Allegedly the Jews were afterwards allowed to remove the bodies and bury them in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>, which was [indecipherable] exception.</sentence><sentence id="409">I strongly suspect that my father had heard about this and that's why he was so worried, because these regulations at work and so on and not using the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> weren't all that bad.</sentence><sentence id="410">And so he summoned us and said, things look grim, and I have the following suggestion.</sentence><sentence id="411">And he said, why don't we claim that my mother is not the biological child of her parents, but that she's an Aryan</sentence><sentence id="413">4 foundling.</sentence><sentence id="414">Sh-She w-was f-found on the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> of her -- her parents in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span>, with a note saying Erika, and then a cross, implying that she is baptized.</sentence><sentence id="415">And Erika was a very German name, so it was implied that she was a German child.</sentence><sentence id="416">And that would make my brother and me half Jews, and as such on-only second class citizens rather than total outcasts.</sentence><sentence id="417">And it -- it -- it left no <span class="DLF">escape hatch</span> for my father, unfortunately, but th-the hope was that perhaps we could send -- he could go off to a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, work for a farmer in som-some lonely <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and then sort of wait until the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="418">Because we had naively assumed that the war would be over within a matter of months, since it was only a matter of playing for time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: I want to ask you a couple questions here.</sentence><sentence id="462">First, it was alw -- it's been my understanding that a half Jew under Nazi racial theory, is a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="463">Why did you think that this would give you a different kind of status?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: In 1935 the Germans passed the so-called Nuremberg laws, where they defined the status of what they called mischlinga, or racially mixed people.</sentence><sentence id="468">And the -- the first level was half Jews, they were deprived of a number of civil rights, but they were still a lev -- a notch or so above Jews.</sentence><sentence id="469">And quarter Jews, again they were banned from certain things, like government jobs and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="470">But -- and anything beyond that was -- was not so bad.</sentence><sentence id="471">I-It -- they -- their -- the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tule</span> was that you had to prove that all four of your grandparents were Aryan.</sentence><sentence id="472">For a quarter Jew, one grandparent was Jewish, for a half Jew, two grandparents were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="473">They were --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="474">Q: In 1941, this mattered?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="475">A: We -- th-that was still the law.</sentence><sentence id="476">Of course, th-they could reinterpret the law and change it without telling us, but up to that time we knew that half Jews still were not as ca -- mi -- were not set equal to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="477">And so we thought that this -- this was about as far as we dared go.</sentence><sentence id="478">There -- there were all sorts of supplementary laws that -- that were Byzantine in their complexity.</sentence><sentence id="479">For</sentence><sentence id="481">5 instance, there was some rule that half Jews normally could not hold government jobs unless they had held these jobs before August 1", 1914.</sentence><sentence id="482">Which means these were old time civil servants from way back, or the exceptions were made if they had fought in World War I, and been decorated, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="483">So there were -- even among half Jews there were different levels.</sentence><sentence id="484">And mind you, until that time there had been no sort of program o-of mass killing of Jews, and therefore there didn't seem to be any -- any problem with half Jews.</sentence><sentence id="485">We certainly knew that they would not be treated as badly.</sentence><sentence id="486">And this was about as far as -- as my father dared to go.</sentence><sentence id="487">My best friend at that time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, who was Edward -- no, George Specter, who was a -- his parents were German Jewish refugees, had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, and they also had two sons George and Edward, only the age relationship was reversed.</sentence><sentence id="488">They played pretty much the same game, they claimed that their mother was Russian, not Jewish, and there was a grain of truth to it, I think she had a Russian grandmother, and -- but all the other grandpa -- grandparents were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="489">So she claimed she was Russian, made her Gentile children were half Jews.</sentence><sentence id="490">And for awhile that was okay, but then they somehow felt sorry for the father, who was lef-left out in the cold, and they decided to try something new, and found an old woman who supposedly had worked as a cook in their <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and she then claimed in a affidavit that the f -- the father was really an illegitimate child of hers, and since she was Aryan, that'd make the father half Jew and then move everybody else up a notch.</sentence><sentence id="491">And that was too much for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="492">They didn't believe it and they f-found a -- a pretext, I believe the -- the youngest son had made some change in the father's passport, and that was document forgery, they arrested him, they arrested the family and of course they were all killed immediately.</sentence><sentence id="493">So what -- first of all one had -- could only go so far, if you s -- the story became too implausible, then you lost the whole game.</sentence><sentence id="494">And the -- the other thing was -- was that we didn't realize yet that not all Gentiles were equal in -- in the eyes of the</sentence><sentence id="496">6 Germans.</sentence><sentence id="497">The Germans were the highest of the hierarchy, they didn't want to shed any German blood, even if it was only 50 percent, but R-Russians were only one level above Jews, and so they didn't much care for those.</sentence><sentence id="498">Is this about the time to flip the tape, or shall -- shall I go on?Yeah, so my mother quickly found a farmer who would t-take my father as an unpaid f-farmhand and so he went out in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>, and we just av -- sort of waited for -- for the war to end.</sentence><sentence id="499">And then, very soon, since we did not wear the yellow patch, of course we -- I th -- I think we may have been stopped by the police and we told them that we are half Jews, and they said, oh if -- if -- if you had -- if that's your excuse, you have to have it -- you have to go and clear that with the German SD, the Sicherheitsdienst.</sentence><sentence id="500">And the commander of that was Untersturmfuehrer Kiigler, a f-fairly notorious man later, as it turned out.</sentence><sentence id="501">So my mother and my older brother went to see him.</sentence><sentence id="502">And my mother was a very attractive woman and a good actress and sh-she told her story with -- with great conviction and apparently impressed him so much that he promptly dictated some special passes for us at -- a-ag-against the -- the -- the German E-Erika Alperovich, and her sons, half Jews George and Edward Alperovich, a -- the regulations concerning Jews shall not be applied.</sentence><sentence id="503">And while this was being typed, he sort of grunted, th-the Jews always got the best German woman.</sentence><sentence id="504">Well, my mother sort of returned the compliment by when she left she raised her -- her -- her arm and said, heil Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="505">So she had fooled him.</sentence><sentence id="506">And we thought, great, well now we have these passes, they -- there was no time limit on them, there were no conditions attached to it, we thought, well we're <span class="BUILDING">home</span> free, so all we have to worry about is my father.</sentence><sentence id="507">Is this the time to -- to switch, or we still -- we still go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="546">Q: [inaudible]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="547">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="548">Okay, so there were a number of cases where we were -- were sort of -- anti-Semites reported us to the police and say here are some Jews that are not wearing the yellow patches, and</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="553">7 we're summoned to the police and we showed our passes.</sentence><sentence id="554">And of course the -- the Germans were much higher i-in the hierarchy than the Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="555">The Latvians pretty well had to do what the Germans told them, and we had this official document with a s-stamp of the SD, and so they let us go free.</sentence><sentence id="556">It was still unpleasant for my mother because a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> knew her.</sentence><sentence id="557">It was an absolutely crazy story for us to start, it was extremely audacious.</sentence><sentence id="558">She had her -- her parents, of course, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all their lives, there were lots of people who knew them.</sentence><sentence id="559">She had two older sisters that conveniently died in the 1930's and there were a number of people who knew that the three sisters looked pretty much alike, and so realized that she was the natural child of her parents.</sentence><sentence id="560">We're still -- and there was one woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who had given birth to a -- a child the same day that my mother was born, and in the same <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">So here were these two women, my maternal grandmother and this other woman, both giving birth to a child, in same <span class="BUILDING">maternity ward</span>, knowing of each other.</sentence><sentence id="562">So if tha -- that woman had known exactly what story we told the Germans, which most of them didn't know, th-they knew for some reason we are -- we are immune, she could very easily have refuted and that she knows my mother was the natural child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="577">Q: This is tape one, side B of an interview with Edward Anders on February 28", 1997.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="579">A: So, as I mentioned, it was a very audacious plan and we -- if we had any inkling that the war was going to last another four years, we never would have tried this plan, because this is a -- a lie that simply couldn't go on for four years.</sentence><sentence id="580">We were just playing for time.</sentence><sentence id="581">Well, it worked all right.</sentence><sentence id="582">The -- I didn't lose my summer job, they kept me there, although I was half Jew, somewhat questionable whether I was employable or not, neither did my -- my brother.</sentence><sentence id="583">But at the end of the summer both of us, of course, had to quit our summer jobs and we tr -- and we had to earn some</sentence><sentence id="585">8 money because my father no longer had an income.</sentence><sentence id="586">And turned out nobody would hire us.</sentence><sentence id="587">The status of half Jews was somewhat indeterminate and most people just didn't want to -- to touch us.</sentence><sentence id="588">Also, the Germans, of course, were trying to -- to get control over the population, find out who the Jews were, so periodically people had to go to the police and re-register their passports, get another stamp and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="589">My mother -- this was in late September "41, my mother went to the <span class="BUILDING">police office</span>, and the Latvian police official treated her with utmost respect and sort of said in almost so many words that he has high regard for her family, he's not going to do anything against her, and she's just going to renew her passport and no questions asked, which was another example that -- of some decent Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="590">There also were enough of the other <span class="NPIP">kind</span>.</sentence><sentence id="591">So, things seemed to be going along fine.</sentence><sentence id="592">We con-continued to look for w -- for -- for jobs, without success.</sentence><sentence id="593">My mother gave some private lessons to various people who wanted to learn German.</sentence><sentence id="594">Most of her pupils were serious.</sentence><sentence id="595">There was one rather peculiar young woman, who was interested only in the sp -- the specialized vocabulary, such as undress and underwear and so on.</sentence><sentence id="596">So anyway my -- my mother taught her whatever she wanted to know or needed to know for her profession, and didn't matter, she paid.</sentence><sentence id="597">Then in November, at -- at my -- the -- at the end of October, the -- this was -- was after harvest time, the farmer decided he no longer needed my father and so sent him <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">My -- by then we had also realized very quickly what was ha -- ha - - happening to -- to the Jews that were ar-arrested.</sentence><sentence id="599">I forgot to mention that within a few days of the German occupation, once the Jews were marked with their yellow patches, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trucks</span> would cruise around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and when they saw a Jew, they would stop, check to see his papers and then put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and he was never seen again.</sentence><sentence id="600">Or, they would come to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> and again, round up the men, take them away, never seen again.</sentence><sentence id="601">And within a very few days there were rumors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> what had happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="602">Some people had actually seen that</sentence><sentence id="604">9 they were just taken to the <span class="DLF">dunes</span> behind the fisherman's wh-wharf, and were shot.</sentence><sentence id="605">Later they found -- the Germans found some -- an execution site farther aw-away in the restricted naval port area and so on, where there weren't as many witnesses.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="637">Q: Did you learn this at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="639">A: Yes, I knew it within a couple weeks or so.</sentence><sentence id="640">And th -- ma -- I -- I heard this from one of our neighbors who obviously was -- felt terribly sorry for the Jews, and he was telling us mainly to warn us.</sentence><sentence id="641">I mean, he -- I don't know whether he had seen himself, whether he had heard it, but it was common knowledge in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> within a matter of days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="645">Q: When you were walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, did you see any violence or brutality?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="647">A: No, never saw any violence.</sentence><sentence id="648">I did see some Jews put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and I later, after the war, I was supposed to testify at the Nuremberg Trials of the German high command, because I remembered the license plates of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="649">I knew that they had German army insignia and navy.</sentence><sentence id="650">And that -- after the war, of course, was fashionable to blame everything on the SS, but the army and the navy were involved.</sentence><sentence id="651">And then one day, standing at the <span class="DLF">streetcar stop</span>, a -- a German sailor stood there and s-struck up a conversation, and of course he enjoyed it because I spoke fluent German.</sentence><sentence id="652">And he said, "Oh you have a lot of Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>."</sentence><sentence id="653">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="654">Oh, then he said, we have -- and then he made a movement of this trigger finger, pulling it several times.</sentence><sentence id="655">We have blank blank a number of them.</sentence><sentence id="656">In other words, executed.</sentence><sentence id="657">Now, he was speaking as a German sailjer -- sailor, I'm not -- one can't be absolutely certain by we he -- he meant w-we the navy, or we the army, or other and -- and the SS, but I think there is evidence that at least the early killings were -- were done with considerable involvement, if not exclusively by -- by the army.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="681">A: I don't think scare is q -- is quite the word because it may not have been quite the first such -- su-such news that I got.</sentence><sentence id="682">Even if it was, when you hear about something's happening to others, especially when you're a teenager, you think it can never happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="683">Drunk driving for example, or getting cancer from smoking.</sentence><sentence id="684">Teenagers think they're immortal.</sentence><sentence id="685">And that time we knew that while there -- some number of Jews were killed, well th -- let's hope it -- maybe they" Il stop the killing.</sentence><sentence id="686">Maybe this was done just in the excess of the first few days of -- of the occupation or what.</sentence><sentence id="687">But in reality of course, there was lots of reason to worry, and some of our relatives disappeared, and -- and th-the pattern that developed in -- in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> was that -- I-I have -- course during -- at the time, I didn't have access to accurate statistics, but I n -- Inow have seen some of the numbers and every week or two there were 50 or 100 Jews executed.</sentence><sentence id="688">They were rounded up in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="689">One of my older relatives, a woman, was picked up when she was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> at the only <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> where Jews were still allowed to shop.</sentence><sentence id="690">And that was a convenient place if they wanted to harvest some Jews, they just send a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> over there, take the people standing in <span class="DLF">line</span>, they won't need the groceries anyway.</sentence><sentence id="691">And so it happened on the -- in -- in a trickle, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="692">My maternal grandfather was arrested on Rosh Hashonah, which was the September 22(tm).</sentence><sentence id="693">He was 83, and he was a rather defiant man who decided since the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> was razed and he couldn't go to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, that he was going to stand at the <span class="DLF">window</span> of his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with his tallis and pray.</sentence><sentence id="694">Of course, it was a provocation.</sentence><sentence id="695">Police saw him at the <span class="DLF">window</span>, picked him up, took him away, Presumably they ki -- that -- checked the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> rather</sentence><sentence id="697">1 carefully that day to see if there weren't any other Jews that were practicing their religion.</sentence><sentence id="698">And I think there were 61 or so shot that day, he was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="699">Then there -- also the -- they -- the- these <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were torn down.</sentence><sentence id="700">None of them had been destroyed or set on fire by either the population or as in some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, by the SD, but they were just torn down, brick by brick.</sentence><sentence id="701">And then they of course took the s -- the scrolls, the Torah scrolls -- and I didn't see this myself, but I heard reports that they unrolled them in one of the squares of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then forced some Jews to step on them, to -- to -- to march on them.</sentence><sentence id="702">And the same person who told me this said that the German soldier came along and he was careful not to step on it, he took a big step across and said, "Th-that's -- that's Holy Scripture."</sentence><sentence id="703">So there were certainly a lot of warnings things were infinitely worse than we had expected, and we -- we didn't realize at the time that this was - - or perhaps we did, this was a total change in policy, that's [indecipherable] the -- now that the Germans had entered the Soviet Union, they were going to kill Jews systematically.</sentence><sentence id="704">Now there's also something about human psychology.</sentence><sentence id="705">Although ther -- there were lots of detailed rumors circulating in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> about the executions of Jews, there were quite a number of Jews who didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="706">There was -- people grasp at straws in such situations.</sentence><sentence id="707">There were occasional rumors that somebody had traveled along a <span class="DLF">country road</span>, and he had passed a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with lots of Jews working there.</sentence><sentence id="708">What they were doing, so on, is pure invention.</sentence><sentence id="709">Railroad traffic was still disrupted, so it -- there wasn't much traffic from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to another, and there was a report by the occasional traveler, yes, he had seen such a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> how reassuring.</sentence><sentence id="710">And yet, the truth was easy enough to find out, it's just a question of how much wishful thinking you want to engage in.</sentence><sentence id="711">Well, anyway, one day in the -- after my -- when my father was at -- returned from his <span class="DLF">farm</span>, he realized that according to th-th-the law, he was supposed to register with the <span class="BUILDING">labor office</span>, volunteer for -- or show up for work at s-seven a.m., but by then it was quite obvious what was</sentence><sentence id="713">2 happening to men, especially, and so it would be suicide.</sentence><sentence id="714">And then the alternative then was to try to hide somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="715">So we decided to hide him in a s -- s-small sort of <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> next to our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, it -- really a little <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="716">We put up a stack of f-firewood, and there -- there was enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> be-behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">firewood</span> for him to hide, and we strategically placed some -- so- some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stools</span> and so on there so that it -- when the doorbell rang, the idea was for him to climb up over the stack and hide behind it, and only then open the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="717">And one day we weren't sure whether the doorbell had rung or not, m-my mother thought it had, and I thought it hadn't. "</sentence><sentence id="718">m not sure what my brother said.</sentence><sentence id="719">So my father didn't go in his <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, he hadn't heard it either, and just then my mo-mother opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there was a Latvian policeman and he said, I am looking for Adolf -- Adolf Alperovich, your husband.</sentence><sentence id="720">My mother realized of course is that we were in real hot water.</sentence><sentence id="721">And of course my f-father had immediately heard his voice.</sentence><sentence id="722">His retreat to his <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was cut off, so all he could do is -- he wa -- he was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> at the time, so he sort of climbed into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> and hid behind clothes.</sentence><sentence id="723">And meanwhile the policeman had entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, was standing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and questioning my mother and -- yeah, questioning my mother, and she -- and meanwhile my father was trying to hide and was making some noise.</sentence><sentence id="724">And realizing that this was very suspicious, my mother decided to throw a sort of quasi-hysterical fit.</sentence><sentence id="725">Said, "I don't know where my husband is.</sentence><sentence id="726">You -- you people took him away.</sentence><sentence id="727">Tell me where my husband is!"</sentence><sentence id="728">And grabbed his wrist and began to shake him, and of course the policeman got quite uncomfortable and uneasy and with her shouting and so on, she masked some of the noises in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and of course we -- we all could hear them, and I don't know how he didn't get suspicious of -- he was sufficiently flustered, when he searched the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> he didn't happen to look in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="729">Well, we thought, managed to survive this, we'll be a lot more careful in the future.</sentence><sentence id="730">But what we didn't realize is that there</sentence><sentence id="732">3 were two people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> who had reported what -- that my father was hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">One of them was the janitor, who was often in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> tending to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boiler</span>, we had a sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">And then the other one was a woman next door, and she could probably hear my father's voice through the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, the c-common <span class="DLF">wall</span> between the two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">And so they must have reported that my father is still there, he had a lower voice than -- than my brother and I, and they could probably hear it.</sentence><sentence id="736">So I was -- second of December deg41, I was out looking for work without success and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and as I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> I heard the crashing of firewood, and I heard a -- a German -- shouting in German, as -- at my father, like something I couldn't quite understand, then heard my father reply, "I am not a criminal."</sentence><sentence id="737">And these were the last words of my father that I heard.</sentence><sentence id="738">What happened is that this time 10 policemen, led by a German had come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, including the man who had searched for my father before and not found him.</sentence><sentence id="739">And they checked the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as thoroughly as they could and they were about to leave, and then the policeman, whose name was Sproigis, decided to look behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">firewood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">The -- he is the one who had searched before and not found my father, and naturally found him.</sentence><sentence id="741">So they took him and my mother away, they left me and I just thought I probably won't see my parents again.</sentence><sentence id="742">My brother had found a <span class="BUILDING">job</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night, I told him the bad news.</sentence><sentence id="744">Then, I think it was either that day or the next, the German policeman came back, escorted by Latvian, and was -- was very friendly and said, "Well, we just want to look around the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> a little bit."</sentence><sentence id="745">And then he went, sort of looked the books, oh [indecipherable] novels and such things, not too interesting.</sentence><sentence id="746">Then he spotted the radio and said, "To whom did this radio belong, to your father, or to your mother?"</sentence><sentence id="747">And I said, "Actually to neither, it belongs to a former <span class="INT_SPACE">roomer</span>."</sentence><sentence id="748">This was, of course, a -- an ext -- a lie.</sentence><sentence id="749">We Jews were supposed to turn in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>, among other things.</sentence><sentence id="750">And he said, "Well, how long ago since he</sentence><sentence id="752">4 was here?" "</sentence><sentence id="753">Well," I said, "he wa -- he was here in -- still in June." "</sentence><sentence id="754">Well," he said, "this is December.</sentence><sentence id="755">Isn't it strange that you haven't her -- heard from him all this time?</sentence><sentence id="756">I'll take the radio along, and if you -- this <span class="INT_SPACE">roomer</span> shows up, tell him it's at the security police."</sentence><sentence id="757">And so he told the Latvian flunky who was with him to pick up the radio, it was a big, heavy model, and off he went.</sentence><sentence id="758">He said, "Don't worry about your parents, they'll be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> soon."</sentence><sentence id="759">Well, half of what he said was true, my mother was released the evening of the -- the eighth of December, and sh-she had signed some waiver that she was never going to tell anybody what happened to her i-in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="760">But she realized that my father was in very serious danger.</sentence><sentence id="761">And so the next morning she dashed off to the police, the German police and asked them, I mean -- or tried to plead for my father's life, and they said it's too late, he was shot that morning.</sentence><sentence id="762">She claimed actually she had -- that on her way she had sort of approached the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and she saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> parked there and she saw several people getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and she thought she recognized my father from a distance.</sentence><sentence id="763">So, he was shot on the ninth of December.</sentence><sentence id="764">And of course we were pretty shocked, but what -- what can you do, this had happened to a lot of people, now it happened to us, but at least we were still alive and we are still protected by these passes.</sentence><sentence id="765">Well that extra protection lasted exactly six days.</sentence><sentence id="766">Four o'clock in the morning on December 15", I su-suddenly woke up, the light had gone on in my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I opened my eyes and I saw two Latvian policeman s-stand there -- st-standing there with rifles over their shoulders and is -- told my brother and me, get dressed, come with us.</sentence><sentence id="767">So what's -- what's the matter?</sentence><sentence id="768">Well, we produced our passes, showing that we are half Jews and they -- nothing -- that they should not -- we -- we were exempt from all the r-rules about Jews.</sentence><sentence id="769">They asked for my father and my -- my mother said that -- she had let the police in, they had been -- they had rung the doorbell, and they -- they searched the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for him, she told them that he had been arrested two weeks earlier.</sentence><sentence id="770">Well, he was still on their list and</sentence><sentence id="772">5 then they -- they checked everywhere. [</sentence><sentence id="773">indecipherable] and when the finished searching the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> they opened the <span class="DLF">back door</span> and there was a policeman standing behind that, cut off any escape.</sentence><sentence id="774">So we asked them, where are you taking us?</sentence><sentence id="775">And they said, we can't tell you.</sentence><sentence id="776">And the na -- older policeman who had -- had a bit -- a touch of humanity left said, "All I can tell you is, dress warmly."</sentence><sentence id="777">So we dressed warmly and went with them, and we kept protesting.</sentence><sentence id="778">They marched us down a <span class="DLF">block</span> or two and we protested that you have no right to arrest us, we're exempt from an -- any actions against Jews.</sentence><sentence id="779">And that -- they stopped at a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> about two or three blocks from -- from ours, and this is where our great-aunt lived, and she was actually the dearest of our relatives.</sentence><sentence id="780">And a few of the policemen went in, and we saw the lights go on in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, in the second <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> they had roused some Jewish families, tell them to get dressed.</sentence><sentence id="781">Meanwhile, th-the other police stayed <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, we had our faces to the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, we were being guarded.</sentence><sentence id="782">And we had been arguing with them.</sentence><sentence id="783">So one young policeman was -- became absolutely livid with this insubordination.</sentence><sentence id="784">And so he went to his superior sergeant, whatever, and asked for permission to shoot us on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="785">And we couldn't hear the answer of the policeman, but anyway, he didn't shoot.</sentence><sentence id="786">I -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> at the time, they actually killed -- out of 24,000 Jews that were taken to the execution, they killed about a thousand 0-on the way, for not walking fast enough, for trying to escape, for talking back, for any number of things.</sentence><sentence id="787">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> for some reason, they did not want to -- to have corpses lying on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, I presume.</sentence><sentence id="788">Maybe they did -- had orders not to do this, and frankly the logical answer would have been, what do you care, you know, a few hours later they'll be dead anyway.</sentence><sentence id="789">So we slowly worked our way toward th-the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, stopping every <span class="DLF">block</span> or so to round up another Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="790">In one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> a woman came out with her two children and then few minutes later she said, "Oh, I forgot -- I forgot to take your father's picture."</sentence><sentence id="791">The poor woman thought that they were going to be deported and it would --</sentence><sentence id="793">6 would be nice to have the father's picture as a souvenir.</sentence><sentence id="794">Of course, they were all going to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="795">We knew it, but -- and our great-aunt knew it and she -- she just looked very composed, pretended not to recognize us, but she knew where it was headed.</sentence><sentence id="796">So the rest of us then -- all of us then slowly worked our way toward the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="797">After -- as we approached the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> we could see there were similar processions coming from other <span class="DLF">side streets</span>, always escorted by Latvian police, and we're admitted int -- into the <span class="DLF">prison yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="798">We were one of the last groups to -- to arrive.</sentence><sentence id="799">It was still dark, it was around seven a.m. or a little before.</sentence><sentence id="800">They -- there was a German policeman reading out lists and he had reached the letter K, I still remember, he was reading the name Katzenelinbogin, so we -- we were -- our ni -- name began with A, so our -- we had been called quite awhile ago.</sentence><sentence id="801">And since we were some of the last to enter, were near the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, faces to the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, the Latvian gatekeeper sort of snuck up to us and said, "Hey fellows, do you have any watches, or any jewelry with you?</sentence><sentence id="802">Your -- you're all going to be taken to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and there they"!l take them away from you.</sentence><sentence id="803">Isn't it better to leave them with your fellow countrymen?"</sentence><sentence id="804">Anyway, we held onto our watches, didn't give him anything.</sentence><sentence id="805">And then f -- a few minutes later was -- was a commotion and we saw that my m -- my mother had managed to sneak into the <span class="DLF">prison yard</span> with another group of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="806">She had first tried to join our group and they wouldn't take her, she was not on the list.</sentence><sentence id="807">And so, now since they -- or they knew who she was, she tried joining another group, but she was recognized, she was pushed out of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="808">And then, another couple minutes later, a German policeman appeared, approached us, and with two or three of the Latvian police in tow who had been -- who had arrested us.</sentence><sentence id="809">And he -- he a -- so he asked, what's your story?</sentence><sentence id="810">And so we showed him our passes and told him.</sentence><sentence id="811">And so he stared at us for about 10 seconds and then suddenly he motioned, go.</sentence><sentence id="812">Now, probably didn't hurt, all of us were blonde and -- and blue-eyed and didn't [indecipherable] hurt that some of my</sentence><sentence id="814">7 blonde hair was sticking out from under my cap and so I looked sufficiently Aryan, my brother did too.</sentence><sentence id="815">Told us, g-go.</sentence><sentence id="816">Barely got out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, we almost bumped into my mother.</sentence><sentence id="817">She had, having been kicked out of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, she had rushed over -- well, she had previously, she had ru- rushed over to the German police, managed to see some -- somebody's -- some official, I don't know how high ranking he was, if he was not the top man, and said look what's happened, my -- my sons are half Jews, they're not supposed to be arrested, and they have been t-taken and can you get them out.</sentence><sentence id="818">And the man was sympathetic, but then he said, what time were they picked up?</sentence><sentence id="819">And she said four o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="820">He looked at the watch, it was seven.</sentence><sentence id="821">Sorry, he said, it's too late.</sentence><sentence id="822">Well, they had no walkie-talkies in those days and it was about a three or four hour march to the <span class="DLF">execution site</span>, so in principle we would have been, if everything had moved as quickly as he thought, we would have been on our way by then, and they couldn't very easily send a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> after us.</sentence><sentence id="823">But we weren't, things were moving more slowly.</sentence><sentence id="824">So she thought that if we were dead, then she certainly didn't want to live and so her only thought was to get back in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, join one of the other groups of Jews, and just be killed with everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="825">And so suddenly she saw us coming.</sentence><sentence id="826">And during all this to-do, as well, during the arrest and the arguments with the police and so on, we were absolutely calm.</sentence><sentence id="827">I think our mood can best be described as of re-restrained indignation.</sentence><sentence id="828">We were indignant but not to the point of -- of shouting or raising our voices, or th- throwing a fit.</sentence><sentence id="829">But now all of a sudden we began to shake, and -- anyway, the shakes lasted for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="830">We walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, by the time we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they were over.</sentence><sentence id="831">My brother had to go to work that -- that day, showed up about an hour late, and I'm not sure what excuse h-he gave.</sentence><sentence id="832">And so we realized we had survived it.</sentence><sentence id="833">Later that day I saw -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I saw a group of Jews being marched across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> north of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">execution site</span>.</sentence><sentence id="834">And it's a ver -- a sad sight to realize that here are these people, we had all been arrested together, I got out, but they</sentence><sentence id="836">8 didn't.</sentence><sentence id="837">And two months ago I learned in graphic detail what would have happened to me if the policeman had not said go, if he had said stay instead.</sentence><sentence id="838">And Ezergailis in his book has an accurate description based on court depositions by some of the Latvian henchman on just how the executions were carried out.</sentence><sentence id="839">And it's weird when after 55 years, when your life, you had reached a <span class="DLF">crossroads</span> and you took a turn to the right and your life had evolved in a well known way and you were still alive, and you suddenly sort of get a flashback where you were at this <span class="DLF">crossroads</span> 55 years ago and you suddenly realize in great detail what would have happened to you if you had gone -- taken the left fork instead of the right fork.</sentence><sentence id="840">Yeah, so it's -- I don't know if anybody else survived.</sentence><sentence id="841">There -- I think there was one Jew who had working papers, I think he would -- also had been rounded up, not in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span>, but I happened to notice there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span> and he produced some paper.</sentence><sentence id="842">Jews in those days who had special skills, and it's very important to the Germans, were spared, at least for the time being.</sentence><sentence id="843">That included craftsmen.</sentence><sentence id="844">One of the wonderful oddities of the German SD in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is -- was the German SD was in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> separate from that of the Latvian SD, and the Latvians were not supposed to go anywhere except the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="845">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> they had a number of Jewish craftsmen, watchmakers, jewelers, goldsmiths, this sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="846">Now it's remarkable why po -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police unit</span> needs goldsmiths on -- on the side.</sentence><sentence id="847">It -- I -- I think nowhere in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> is a police unit that has goldsmiths, and -- and watchmakers and so on.</sentence><sentence id="848">And neither do the Swiss police or any other I know of.</sentence><sentence id="849">On the other hand, th-the German security police was a rather special organization.</sentence><sentence id="850">So we were -- we were free, but then, couple days later we got a summons to go to the police and we as -- were to turn in our passes.</sentence><sentence id="851">And they said, well, this is now out of the security police's hands, mixed bloods are now handled by the civilian administration, the so-called kibice commissar.</sentence><sentence id="852">And you have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, there is a man named Butkarite who takes care of</sentence><sentence id="854">9 such things.</sentence><sentence id="855">So my mother and my older brother, who was -- usually went -- I was considered too young, of the two of us he was a more obvious companion on such missions, went there, she told her story and he said well, we'll -- you'll have to do several things right away.</sentence><sentence id="856">First of all, you'll have to file for divorce from your husband.</sentence><sentence id="857">Then you'll have to get at least two affidavits from people that know you, that can prove that -- that your story is true.</sentence><sentence id="858">And then, he said, you" ll have to produce a baptismal certificate.</sentence><sentence id="859">Okay, filing su -- for divorce was no big deal, she did.</sentence><sentence id="860">Then months or so later, a -- a -- a letter arrived from the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, saying that proceedings had been -- been dr-dropped, because the case was moot, since the state prosecutor had notified the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> that my father had died on the ninth of December 1941.</sentence><sentence id="861">Well, this came in handy after the war when my mother was trying to get some restitution payments -- pension from -- from German authorities and they wanted to have some proof that my father was killed, and under the circumstances this was the next best thing to an actual death certificate.</sentence><sentence id="862">S-So I-I will actually deposit a copy of this with the -- with the archives.</sentence><sentence id="863">Then the affidavits turned out not to be a problem, and I considered it somewhat indicative of the fact that there still were a fairly large number of decent people among Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="864">We had moved into our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> only two years earlier, and there was one -- the f -- of our neighbors there was one family who clearly were v- very troubled by the way we were treated, and they just -- at every opportunity they showed that their sympathies were the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="865">So my mother went to them and asked, could you help us?</sentence><sentence id="866">So quickly they figured out the best thing to do was the mother of -- of our neighbor would file an affidavit claiming that many years ago -- she was an old lady by then, that she had met, in going to the <span class="DLF">park</span> with her own daughter and she had met th -- a sort of maid that was taking care of my -- my mother.</sentence><sentence id="867">And they'd often taken out the children for walks together, and then the maid told her one day, this is not the real child of her parents, it's a foundling, a Christian foundling and so</sentence><sentence id="869">0 on.</sentence><sentence id="870">And so embellish the story [indecipherable] all well known.</sentence><sentence id="871">So that was affidavit number one.</sentence><sentence id="872">The other one was by a younger woman who again test -- testified that she had met my -- my mother oh so, 10 to 15 years before the war, they'd become friends, and then one day my mother again confided in her that she wasn't the real child of her parents and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="873">And then she went on to say, well we, together -- she really had a Christian orientation, together we attended services in Saint Anne's church and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="874">A -- a number of embellishments or outright inventions and so forth, then stressed that well, th-the children were brought up le -- no - - in -- in the [indecipherable] Christian spirit.</sentence><sentence id="875">That wasn't true at all, but th-they -- they went to a <span class="BUILDING">Latvian school</span>, not to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="876">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they used the German language and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="877">So again, she did her -- her best to make the story sound as plausible as possible.</sentence><sentence id="878">One thing I forgot to mention earlier, that the first -- when we got our first set of passes, and my mother had practically n-nothing to prove her case.</sentence><sentence id="879">But for years she had been corresponding with, of all things, the Rosicrucian fellowship in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oceanside</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">They had a correspondence service in any number of languages, she corresponded in German.</sentence><sentence id="881">I'm not quite sure why she corresponded with them, in part because she wanted some health advice, in part because there were some strains in her marriage and she wanted some counseling and so on, and they basically level-headed people, gave her some good advice.</sentence><sentence id="882">And there were occasional references to Jesus Christ, and you know, praying to him and -- and all would be well.</sentence><sentence id="883">And those she was able to filter out, and she was concentrating more on some vegetarian or whatever recipes, some herbal teas and so forth, and some of the good, common sense advice about how to deal with my father.</sentence><sentence id="884">But this was helpful, this was obviously a Christian organization and it's before the war, before there was any si -- ca -- question of trying to h-hide your Jewish origin, she was -- obviously had a Christian orientation.</sentence><sentence id="885">And the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> at that time had not yet been in the war, so -- this was</sentence><sentence id="887">1 before Pearl Harbor, so those letters came in handy.</sentence><sentence id="888">Now that the tough part were the baptismal certificates.</sentence><sentence id="889">We were told that the archives of the <span class="BUILDING">Baltic German churches</span> had all been removed to what -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span>, which originally was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span>, and of course they'd been annexed by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="890">And they had settled a number of Baltic Germans there, and they clearly want to expand German -- ethnic German settlement eastward as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="891">This is -- was already part of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="892">So the church records were supposed to be there, and she was supposed to write to them.</sentence><sentence id="893">Okay, so composed the letter, sent it off.</sentence><sentence id="894">Fortunately, mail took one month to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> and then one month back.</sentence><sentence id="895">It was in early 42.Then, the first -- it turned out the first address they'd given us wasn't the right one, so th -- took another set of letters and by the time the three months were up, all she had is this first letter saying sorry, you wrote to the wrong address.</sentence><sentence id="896">So she went to the kibice commissar, Mr.Butkarite and said, well, I've -- I've tried to do what you told me, but it's taking awhile, and here is the st-story.</sentence><sentence id="897">So he gave her a three month extension.</sentence><sentence id="898">He wasn't totally happy about it.</sentence><sentence id="899">Then after three months, well we had another exchange and the people at the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> had misunderstood the question.</sentence><sentence id="900">They -- they said well, before we can do a search, you have to give the exact names of your parents and the date of your birth and the date of your baptism and all that.</sentence><sentence id="901">And my mother's date of birth was -- in -- in the records, was supposed to be the date when she was found, so she must have been born sometime previous to that.</sentence><sentence id="902">So, clearly they had misunderstood the question, this took another round of letters, and now Mr. Butkarite was getting impatient, he said, I'll give you one more three month extension, but that's going to be it.</sentence><sentence id="903">Three months were up and of course we didn't have anything yet.</sentence><sentence id="904">And as the 90 days approached their end, you know, you start closing your accounts with the world and just be -- be prepared that you will be taken away and you will be shot, like so many people before you.</sentence><sentence id="905">And my</sentence><sentence id="907">2 mother went there with my brother and asked Mr. Butkarite and they said, oh no, he's no longer here.</sentence><sentence id="908">It's now Mr. Persil has taken his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="909">So my mother did some fast footwork and sort of backspaced a little bit and -- in the story and sort of took Mr. Persil to -- a few steps back from where we actually were, to gain time.</sentence><sentence id="910">Persil gave her the three months extension.</sentence><sentence id="911">And again, his patience gradually wore thin.</sentence><sentence id="912">And just when it seemed to be over, might have given us the final three months extension, once again he -- he was transferred, and in his <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a certain Mr. -- Mr. Gudschmidt.</sentence><sentence id="913">And well, meanwhile what been happening, it turned out that the church records were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> after all, they were not in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="914">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> state archive was closed indefinitely and so that gained us some more time, but in then end it was opened.</sentence><sentence id="915">My mother and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> and looked the records, and lo and behold we found two girls were baptized Erika in the three months preceding the supposed date that my mother was found.</sentence><sentence id="916">Now the next step would have been to prove that my mother was one of these, which how do you -- do you prove that?</sentence><sentence id="917">I suppose you -- you prove that there was -- this person vanished without a trace.</sentence><sentence id="918">And Mr. Gudschmidt was no fool, he realized that as long as my mother was doing the -- this research herself, she could suppress any unfavorable evidence, and this could go on forever.</sentence><sentence id="919">And so he flatly refused to extend the passes.</sentence><sentence id="920">Well, we -- now we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we thought well, will the police come today or tomorrow?</sentence><sentence id="921">Will they come and pick us up at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or at work?And if at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> will it be during the day or during the night?</sentence><sentence id="922">And no, we were prepared for the worst.</sentence><sentence id="923">Instead, nothing whatsoever happened.</sentence><sentence id="924">Well, one of the weird things is during deg41 and deg42, there were a number of anti-Semites who repeatedly reported us to the police, and said here are some Jews who are not wearing the yellow patch.</sentence><sentence id="925">And eventually they got discouraged, and one rumor that was -- was circulated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was that we had connections to <span class="NPIP">high places</span>, specifically to Goering's staff.</sentence><sentence id="926">Well, Ih -- wondered why Goering and I s-suddenly realized why</sentence><sentence id="928">3 -- why they came up with this story.</sentence><sentence id="929">My mother had an office job in a tiny, little <span class="BUILDING">four person office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="930">It had a very, sort-of pretentious name.</sentence><sentence id="931">It was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostland</span> was in -- the name for the three <span class="REGION">Baltic countries</span>, plus <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Byelorussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="932">It was Ostland Iron Trading company of the state works, Herman Goering -- in the name of Herman Goering.</sentence><sentence id="933">All it was is a small <span class="BUILDING">purchasing office</span> that was supposed to negotiate exports of the products of a large <span class="BUILDING">metal working factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> and have them shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="934">And they would transfer the orders, negotiate delivery schedules and so on.</sentence><sentence id="935">Totally innocuous.</sentence><sentence id="936">But o-on -- on this <span class="INT_SPACE">street level</span>, on th-the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, there was a plaque saying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostland</span> [speaks foreign language here] etcetera, etcetera, Herman Goering.</sentence><sentence id="937">Well, these are big words that the average Latvian probably had trouble figuring them out.</sentence><sentence id="938">The only thing that probably made sense to them was Herman Goering, and so they saw my mother going in and out of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and they thought well, there is some <span class="BUILDING">office</span> close that's close to Herman Goering and sh-she has ca -- she has access to it, and sh-she has some -- some dealings with them.</sentence><sentence id="939">Well, I wish I knew who started this rumor, because I couldn't have invented a better one myself.</sentence><sentence id="942">4 Beginning Tape Two, Side A</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1366">A: Well, it is -- we had a special status.</sentence><sentence id="1367">A half Jew was neither fish nor fowl, and at least for a long time it was not counted as a fowl.</sentence><sentence id="1368">I have been told that there -- on the internet there is -- is a website of Jews who sa -- served in the German army, it turned out that -- that virtually all of them were half Jews, or quarter Jews, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1369">And I understand that Hitler said at one point, I decide who is a Jew, and who isn't.</sentence><sentence id="1370">And so they would make some people honorary Aryans, but of course the flipside of the coin was that you were made to serve in the German army.</sentence><sentence id="1371">So it -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> -- you will probably si -- hear it during the rest of my story, much of the time people still weren't sure wh-what -- what rights I had and what rights I-I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And some were -- were prudent and just didn't want to -- anything to do with half Jews, others would take a chance.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1499">Q: Was it your understanding at the time that the local population was also quite involved in a lot of these -- the killings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1501">A: The -- the population as such, actually was not.</sentence><sentence id="1502">There were, probably in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, I'm sure there were several thousand who were actively or passively involved in the killings.</sentence><sentence id="1503">There were some executions squads.</sentence><sentence id="1504">I think the most notorious one was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, the so-called Arajs Commando, several hundred who traveled in notorious blue <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to execute Jews that had been rounded up by the local police.</sentence><sentence id="1505">There were others who were Latvian police who really just traffic cops and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1506">They were assigned the job of rounding up Jews, as the ones who arrested us, but in just leading them to the <span class="BUILDING">execution site</span>, or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, driving people to the <span class="BUILDING">execution site</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And th -- and there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> the shootings were done by Germans at the time that the -- the big executions.</sentence><sentence id="1508">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> there were several execution squads, as I found out much</sentence><sentence id="1510">1 later from Ezergailis" book.</sentence><sentence id="1511">There was one Latvian squad and a German squad and they would take turns.</sentence><sentence id="1512">The Germans always tried to s -- to st -- to stress the local people's role in these executions.</sentence><sentence id="1513">They would often take pictures only when a local squad was -- was doing the shooting and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1514">Kiigler, the -- the head of the SD, who had given us the first set of passes, apparently was a -- a passionate photographer and he went to every execution, even if it involved only few dozen Jews and always took pictures.</sentence><sentence id="1515">And supposedly these pictures have been found in the -- apparently it's -- it's a well known collection.</sentence><sentence id="1516">I don't particularly want to see it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1535">Q: When the Latvians worked as -- you know, administrators, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1536">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1537">Q: -- nestled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couriers</span> or guards, was it your sense that they worked with enthusiasm or that they in a position where they really had to follow the German directives?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1539">A: Those that did the dirty work, from rounding up Jews and certainly those who did the killing, there was no indication of any touch of sympathy for the victims.</sentence><sentence id="1540">Certainly it would not have been safe to show it, because even if a few of them felt some slight sympathy and said this -- well, this -- I'm sorry that I have to do this dirty job, there were others who were doing it with enthusiasm, like the young policeman who was prepared to shoot us on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="1541">And if he had noticed that one of the other policeman felt sorry for us, that would have been a lot of trouble for them.</sentence><sentence id="1542">But I was interested -- yesterday, in the seminar I read a short quote from the report of the German police commander.</sentence><sentence id="1543">He issued sort of biweekly situation reports a-about all sorts of events under his jurisdiction, and always starting with, oh what's the mood of the people.</sentence><sentence id="1544">And the report immediately after these mass executions of mid-December of 1941, he said there is widespread unease and disapproval among the local people about the execution of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1545">Many of them feel sorry for what happened to the Jews, and only a few have expressed themselves</sentence><sentence id="1547">2 positively.</sentence><sentence id="1548">And in retrospect I can agree with that, because somehow when you -- when you're in the midst of it, what registers much more strongly is the occasional anti-Semitic remark or act.</sentence><sentence id="1549">What registers much less strongly is the passive tolerance, and there were an awful lot of people that tolerated us, that could have turned us in and didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1550">Occa -- some of them went so far as to say some kind words and express their sympathies and so on, and we t -- we quickly found out who they were an-and in retrospect, I remember quite a few of them.</sentence><sentence id="1551">And others simply decided to look the other way, and not do anything for us, not do anything against us.</sentence><sentence id="1552">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L-Libau</span> was perhaps a little different in the sense that there was -- the population by and large was friendlier to the Jews than in so-some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, although it was -- I don't think it was that different elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1553">They simply were not the so c -- the -- they didn't deserve -- the -- the majority of people weren't the stereotype bloodthirsty Latvian henchmen as th-the executioners were.</sentence><sentence id="1554">There's no question that there were a few thousand involved in various capacities, who committed the-these atrocities, and did it with -- with -- with pleasure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1573">Q: Do you remember whether you felt a lot of stress or fear, anxiety, during this time when you were passing as a half Jew, but you weren't -- you weren't really in hiding, you were in public.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1575">A: First of all, if you live a lie, after awhile you begin to believe it, almost.</sentence><sentence id="1576">I was circumcised, and so there was a constant fear I would be in a situation where this would be found out.</sentence><sentence id="1577">So that was the danger, but teenagers always think that they're invulnerable and immortal.</sentence><sentence id="1578">And furthermore, life kept you busy.</sentence><sentence id="1579">There were the problems of everyday life, I had a job, I didn't have that -- I worked six days a week, I didn't have that much free time, and then the routines of everyday life took time.</sentence><sentence id="1580">I had some friends, Latvian friends and so on, who -- who were very nice to me and enjoyed associating with me and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1581">So life was too busy to worry, and worrying is not going to change it anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1582">I -- one of my favorite philosophers is Schopenhauer,</sentence><sentence id="1584">3 once said that when you are concerned about a calamity that may happen in the future -- there are really two kinds of calamities, there is the -- the calamity that you know it's going to happen, but you don't know when.</sentence><sentence id="1585">The second kind is, it may or may not happen on a particular date that is already fixed.</sentence><sentence id="1586">So in the first case, you should act as if this calamity was going to happen in the very distant future, so don't worry about it.</sentence><sentence id="1587">In the second case, yes, the date's approaching, but let's hope for the best.</sentence><sentence id="1588">And actually that's good advice, and so I pretty much live by that.</sentence><sentence id="1589">So I can't remember ever being really depressed and so on, it was a game to survive and I f -- I felt that I was going to do my best and just hope I did the right thing each time when I came to some decision point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1607">Q: So there was a part of this that was almost an adventure?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1609">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1610">Yes, in fact, this was certainly one of the stronger emotions the -- the night that I was arrested, that I felt this was an injustice, these people had no right to arrest me, I was a half Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1611">I almost believed it myself.</sentence><sentence id="1612">Chutzpah.</sentence><sentence id="1613">Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1628">A: I thought about it.</sentence><sentence id="1629">A number of our relatives were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, so we only had indirect information.</sentence><sentence id="1630">There was one postcard that came from my aunt saying that her husband and son were in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1631">She believed it, perhaps, or maybe this was her code word, but this was clear they'd been rounded up within the first few weeks of the German occupation and shot.</sentence><sentence id="1632">And I suspected so much at the time; by then we knew what the game was.</sentence><sentence id="1633">Those in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> were mainly elderly relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1634">My grandfather, of course, war arrested on Rosh Hashonah.</sentence><sentence id="1635">My</sentence><sentence id="1637">4 grandmother, who was also in her 80's was put to work cleaning the mortar off bricks from bombed out <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1638">But -- but she was again arrested in this mid-December action and she was shot, my great-aunt, and -- and so they were picked off.</sentence><sentence id="1639">There weren't all that -- that many of them, but they were picked off one after the other, the men jun -- in July, and the women, at latest, December.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And I understand that the others did too.</sentence><sentence id="1641">One of them after the war, I found out, was still alive as late as "44, but then died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1642">And so I -- I didn't really know about some of the individuals, especially in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, but I pretty well expected that few, if any, would survive.</sentence><sentence id="1643">And there was nothing I could do for them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1662">Q: Just must have been an odd feeling at the time, to see other people taken out, or -- you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1664">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1665">I -- you can't let the, sort of emotions and so on, really overwhelm you.</sentence><sentence id="1666">It is very sad, but somehow you -- you realize that your primary task is to survive in spite of it.</sentence><sentence id="1667">A-And, I mean, do the best you can and just try to rise to each challenge.</sentence><sentence id="1668">Yes, it's a -- it's a great injustice that the Jews are being killed, but the most constructive thing I co -- I could make -- I could do is try to survive myself.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And if there was an opportunity that -- certainly I would have bi -- would have liked to help them, but it was -- was dangerous.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1676">Q: Do you think there is something about the way you were raised, the way your parents are, that enabled you to pull this off in a way that other people might not have been able to?</sentence><sentence id="1677">Are there certain qualities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1680">A: The most important thing probably was not to look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1681">This was always a ve -- almost a - - a joke among relatives, friends and so on when they first met us, they -- they said, well, they -- they don't look Jewish, my brother and I, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1682">Well -- and at the time it was of an oddity, but i-it -- it was -- was no practical consequences, but suddenly the consequence became very</sentence><sentence id="1684">5 important.</sentence><sentence id="1685">They were -- alright, I'll probably come to that a little later.</sentence><sentence id="1686">Do you have another question that you want to check?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1696">Q: It seems that in a way you had a sort of contradictory approach in terms of dealing with the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1712">Q: Did you expect to be rejected by saying you were a half Jew?</sentence><sentence id="1713">And if you hadn't been rejected, did you think about what that might have involved?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1716">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1717">Let me take up this whole complex of military service.</sentence><sentence id="1718">In -- after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>, Goebbels gave a famous speech in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, s -- asking the audience, carefully

war.</sentence><sentence id="1720">Well, one of the consequence of total war is that the Germans suddenly decided that they were going to get -- they ca -- whatever help they can get from whatever <span class="NPIP">quarter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1721">So they established a draft in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, set up a Latvian SS legion.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1722">Previously they had organized only police battalions which were used in some fairly low level capacity fighting guerillas be-behind the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, so -- but these were going to be combat</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1726">6 divisions of the Waffen SS.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And they -- I think they said that there's six years, around 1919 to 1924, wherever that went out, to report to military for -- were going to be inducted.</sentence><sentence id="1728">And it took several months for them to set everything up, so my brother's turn, he was born in 1924 came in about November of 1943.</sentence><sentence id="1729">And it -- he was summoned by the military authorities, he passed the physical as anybody would have, and he was sent off

id="1732">There were some Latvian ethnic Poles because normally the Poles were just one sn -- notch above Jews, and some Ukrainians, and whatnot, I mean -- so they were put in this special unit for basic training and one day they got a pep talk, and they said, you will be sent to the toughest combat.</sentence><sentence id="1733">Those of you who prove themselves, will have a place in the new Europe, which was Hitler's slogan for what was going to come after the war, and those that don't, well, beware.</sentence><sentence id="1734">So, what choice do you have?</sentence><sentence id="1735">But then i-if -- few weeks later, the -- they s -- the German liaison officer apparently decided that it wasn't right that a half Jew should be wearing a German police uniform, and so he s -- ordered that my brother be dismissed.</sentence><sentence id="1736">He -- my brother wrote a petition which I still have, asking to be allowed to fight against Bolshevism, which was terribly important and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1737">And the co-company commander, Latvian approved it, the battalion commander, also Latvian, approved it, the German liaison officer rejected it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1738">Supposedly he said he knew of one <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where some half Jew with some particular merits was allowed to st -- to stay in the German police, but lacking these special merits, my brother didn't qualify, so he was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1739">And he had to -- barely arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> than the draft board got after him and said, well you" ll have to come for another examination and we will just draft you in the Waffen

they're not as choosy.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Well, before he could appear there, he got sick with -- with typhoid and diphtheria, was put in a <span

him very bad care, and he died.</sentence><sentence id="1747">A day or so before he died, he told her -- he was already in -- in fever, he told her that he had to [indecipherable] he had a -- a bad dream that he had to climb su - - a mountain of death, which is strange that -- this premonition.</sentence><sentence id="1748">And the next day he died.</sentence><sentence id="1749">So this was a very hard blow for me because we had become very close since -- at the time we -- I had one or two other friends, but we were much closer, very reliant on one another.</sentence><sentence id="1750">Was nothing to do, eventually my turn would come, I was two years younger.</sentence><sentence id="1751">And realizing that my turn would come soon, I thought, well anything was better than serving in -- in the ground forces.</sentence><sentence id="1752">Air force was the lead unit, it was out of the question.</sentence><sentence id="1753">I tried to volunteer for the navy, and they said, well sorry, we can't take half Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1754">Then there was the German labor organization, but normally they took people at 17 f-for [indecipherable] anything to gain time, that may -- may be better than military service, again they wouldn't take me.</sentence><sentence id="1755">And then, at the end of July "44, they -- a notice appeared in the paper that everybody born

30 - 50 miles a day, and at that rate they would have been in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> within a few days.</sentence><sentence id="1757">The result is that of some 500 young men of that age group, only about eight showed up for induction.</sentence><sentence id="1758">Two half Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1759">Me, and the real one, his mother was Greek.</sentence><sentence id="1760">We did not dare take any chances, cause if the Russians weren't there the next day, or in a few days, if we hadn't shown up for induction this would have been a wonderful excuse for them to kill us.</sentence><sentence id="1761">The Latvians could play games, they could hide on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1762">We didn't have these connections, we couldn't have done it, so nothing -- no, we showed up for induction.</sentence><sentence id="1763">And then they were ready to draft us, but then we</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1767">8 said we are half Jews, oh well, that shouldn't be much of a problem.</sentence><sentence id="1768">And I said, well my f -- my brother was in -- inducted in the police battalion, then he was discharged a half Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1769">Oh no, no, the SS is different, but to be on the safe side, we'll check with <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, and they gave me a temporary deferment until further notice, and also the other half Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1770">And -- well, again, play for time.</sentence><sentence id="1771">Just about the same time, since the Russians were advancing very quickly, a lot of people were afraid that the Russians would take my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, and they would be under the Russians again and by then the Germans were sufficiently indebted to the Latvians that they decided that Latvians could, in principle, seek refuge in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but subject to political clearance, that they were reliable.</sentence><sentence id="1772">So we felt that it was a question of a mount -- Mohammed going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> because w-we could have sat there forever waiting for the -- the western allies to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, it wasn't going to happen, that we had to move west, and this was our chance.</sentence><sentence id="1773">So it turned out that , well the -- the first thing to do was to get this political clearance.</sentence><sentence id="1774">And I had to go to the very same police that had wanted to arrest me and -- and shoot me a f -- a few years earlier.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1775">Filled out the form, and then every hour a policeman would come out with a stack of forms that had been at -- ei-either accept or rejected, and he would call out the names, and so I had to -- took time off from work, just stand there and wait, because I didn't want my name to be called every hour because there would be enough people to -- who would recognize it, and I might be in deep trouble.</sentence><sentence id="1776">So, as soon as my n -- my name and my mother's name was -- was called, I promptly got the slips, looked at them, and they were both stamped okay, approved to emigration.</sentence><sentence id="1777">I don't know what files they checked.</sentence><sentence id="1778">We were on their death list a couple of years earlier, and now all of a sudden we're kosher again.</sentence><sentence id="1779">Was absurd.</sentence><sentence id="1780">Th-The tape --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue

-- there was a notation on my sl-slip saying that for the time being, is not permitted to leave because I'm a man between 16 and 60 and they have to be kept in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1788">Well, my mother, in her usual way said, I don't want to go anywhere without you, let's drop it.</sentence><sentence id="1789">I said, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1790">Let's try to get some papers for you.</sentence><sentence id="1791">The next step was to get an L.D. card, and -- to emigrate into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1792">And I had -- my mother's passport had a couple of very serious handicaps.</sentence><sentence id="1793">One was her Jewish first name, Rachel.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And I had taken that out with sodium hypochlorite [indecipherable] a budding chemist, and there's some -- still a nice stain on the passport, showing where that was.</sentence><sentence id="1795">And the second one, her m-maiden name was Scheftelovich, a very Jewish sounding name, and Leventhals, which -- which, come to think of it, Leventhal is also a Jewish name.</sentence><sentence id="1796">And these -- these double names have a strange origin from Tsarist times because in the Tsarist days when -- when somebody was drafted into the army, that was for 25 years, which means you can just say goodbye to a normal life, no marriage, no children and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1797">And so the game was to avoid military service at all costs.</sentence><sentence id="1798">I don't know exactly how the game was played, but apparently one of the tricks was to find some childless families that would sort of pretend that your child was theirs.</sentence><sentence id="1799">And so that my grandfather's children were all farmed out to different families and so each t-time, each such incident gave rise to another double name.</sentence><sentence id="1800">My mother ended up a <span class="BUILDING">Scheftelovich-Leventhals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1801">So we had to go to the -- again to the kibice commissar's office, and apply f-for -- and se -- an I.D. card for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1802">And standing in <span class="DLF">line</span>, I looked over the girls that were taking care of these applications and I tried to pick the dumbest one.</sentence><sentence id="1803">She was mentally slow and seemed confused.</sentence><sentence id="1804">Anyway, when my turn came, she was -- was bewildered by these multiple names, and so, on my mother's passport, and she was quite happy to let me dictate to her what she was to write.</sentence><sentence id="1805">So first of all I told her to write just Leventhals.</sentence><sentence id="1806">The Latvian spelling didn't look -- to a German eyes, didn't look too obviously like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leventhal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1809">0 And -- but -- and Scheftelovich was completely edited out this way.</sentence><sentence id="1810">And then she said, what nationality?</sentence><sentence id="1811">I said, write Volksdeutsche.</sentence><sentence id="1812">German.</sentence><sentence id="1813">So she did.</sentence><sentence id="1814">Fine, but then she had to take it into her boss to -- to sign, and the -- the boss saw Volksdeutsche.</sentence><sentence id="1815">Are you registered with Miss So and So, who apparently was the person there that kept track of all the -- the ethnic Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1816">And I said no. "</sentence><sentence id="1817">Oh, then you can't claim to be Volksdeutsche."</sentence><sentence id="1818">So he told the girl, "Why did you write Volksdeutsche?</sentence><sentence id="1819">Cross it out, and write Latland" -- <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1820">That -- yeah, that -- okay, that meant -- he didn't say to write that she was Latvian, she just had to write <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1821">But -- and although Volksdeutsche was crossed out, it was still legible.</sentence><sentence id="1822">And this was just good enough, when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> later to pretend that she was a Volksdeutsche from <span class="REGION">Latland</span>, which is the somewhat quaint way of -- of saying that.</sentence><sentence id="1823">So we had Aryanized her by another couple of -- of steps.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1872">A: I most certainly did not want to be -- to join the military, because this was the last year of the war, and the conditions were pretty grim.</sentence><sentence id="1873">Being in an SS uniform, of course made you much more likely to be, sort of, killed if the Russians succeeded in capturing you.</sentence><sentence id="1874">And conditions were</sentence><sentence id="1876">1 very rough at the front, so I certainly didn't want to serve in the military.</sentence><sentence id="1877">But I also had no realistic way of -- of dodging the draft.</sentence><sentence id="1878">Latvians could go and hide on a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, they could disappear in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and join some of the small guerilla units.</sentence><sentence id="1879">I had no such option.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And of course the f -- the farther -- th-the longer those -- the war lasted, the more conspicuous were a young man of military age who were not in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="1881">So I was prepared to take my chances.</sentence><sentence id="1882">I certainly had to tell them sooner rather than later I was a half Jew, but if they had said, that's quite alright, we'll draft you, I would have had no choice, would -- would have put on a uniform and been gone wherever they'd sent me.</sentence><sentence id="1883">And I am very glad it never came to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1898">Q: By saying you were a half Jew, did you think at some <span class="NPIP">level</span> you would be disqualified?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1906">Q: Did you think about what you might have had to do if you had been drafted?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1908">A: Yes, the Waffen SS, it's sort of an oddity of German military organization, that they put the so-called Latvian legionnaires into the Waffen SS.</sentence><sentence id="1909">They could just as well have put them in the regular army, because they had essentially no connection with the SS, and the atrocities that are associated with the s -- SS.</sentence><sentence id="1910">For some reason they organized these foreign legions, so to speak, as part of the Waffen SS, which was an elite organization and -- but without all the connotations that go with it.</sentence><sentence id="1911">Naturally, among the Latvian legionnaires, there were a number wh-who were, especially among the officers [indecipherable] had been involved in killing Jews and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1912">And other were anti-Semites just from way back.</sentence><sentence id="1913">But by and large it was a -- sort of a fairly average bunch of Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="1914">They -- if taken prisoner by the Russians -- of course, since these</sentence><sentence id="1916">2 were nominally Soviet citizens as far as they were concerned, of course they were all likely to be treated very badly, possibly killed or sent to the <span class="BUILDING">gulag</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1917">But th-that's something you pretty much had to accept in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1918">It's just that I had no real alternative, and as a -- as a half Jew, I could not dodge the draft.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1937">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1938">So at th -- at this point we had a new LD.</sentence><sentence id="1939">card for my mother, which was significantly Aryanized, and we -- but we didn't have anything for me, and I was not allowed to go.</sentence><sentence id="1940">The Russians had stopped their advance temporarily, but then came September they were advancing again, and th -- th-they -- before long, in -- in early October, they al-also managed to take <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, and the Germans decided that they were going to make my home province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Courland</span> into a -- essentially a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1941">So everybody who was not working was then pressed into service to go out in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> all day and come back late in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="1942">My mother and I had to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1943">After a few days I had developed some serious problems with my ankle, and some young German medics decided that I was not suitable for hard physical work, and he gave me an exemption so I could stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1944">There were very frequent air raids.</sentence><sentence id="1945">I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and sort of cooked meals and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1946">My mother went out to -- to dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, and my principle in those days was never to wash the dishes until evening because you never knew whether the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> would be destroyed by bombs, in that case why waste the effort of washing dishes first?</sentence><sentence id="1947">So this - - we somehow managed to last through September, and then in early October the Russians managed to -- to punch through to the Baltic in -- somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, and -- effectively</sentence><sentence id="1949">3 cutting off what was left of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1950">At that point, apparently, for a few days the Germans decided that things looked a bit risky and they had better evacuate those civilians who were friendly to them.</sentence><sentence id="1951">So all of a sudden this restriction that men were not allowed to leave was lifted, and I got the green light.</sentence><sentence id="1952">Of course, we promptly signed up to leave, and managed to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, and were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.367" long="18.633">Danzig</span>, arrived there in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="1953">I produced my I.D. card from this <span class="BUILDING">home study institute</span> and it was duly stamped by -- with the immigration stamp with the official German eagle, so it ha -- I now had an I.D. that at least had semi-official status, thanks to the immigration stamp.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Latvian former diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="2129">And when we needed -- who was originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> and then he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2130">And when we needed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span>, we needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, we wrote him, and he said, we'll be very happy to have you stay with us.</sentence><sentence id="2131">So he treated us very nicely.</sentence><sentence id="2132">He knew our story and he could very well see through it, he was smart enough for that.</sentence><sentence id="2133">So when we were there, he had invited some of his friends, and -- including a German soldier who had learned Latvian, and</sentence><sentence id="2135">8 they were so -- outdoing themselves, including the German soldier, in making derogatory remarks about Hitler and the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="2136">And these were Latvian intellectuals, and they certainly were nice to us.</sentence><sentence id="2137">They could easily have done us in just on the basis on their suspicions, and they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2138">And yet it was also quite clear that they were not in sympathy with the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="2139">So they were decent people and those people were critical of the regime, but what should not be underestimated is how difficult it is to rise against the police state.</sentence><sentence id="2140">Okay, shall I continue with the story?</sentence><sentence id="2141">Well, we got to the -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kometau</span>, and arrived at the -- the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of our -- our prospect -- the Fisher family.</sentence><sentence id="2142">We had with us a sort of a s -- a small bag with five pounds of Latvian bacon.</sentence><sentence id="2143">Of course, they were starved for anything like this, and they all ate to their hearts content and got sick to their stomachs, but I mean [indecipherable] used to such rich fare.</sentence><sentence id="2144">We had went -- s-spent the night waiting in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, there was no local transportation, we didn't know where to go, so we had a sleepless night, and only had to wait until daybreak before we could visit our hosts.</sentence><sentence id="2145">So we arrived there midaft -- mid-morning, and anyway by -- sort of shortly after noon we decided we need a nap.</sentence><sentence id="2146">The family said, why don't you go to our <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and just stretch out and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2147">Aft -- and we left our -- our bags downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="2148">Afterwards when we came down I noticed that my mother had not locked the bag, and in her suitcase the uppermost item was a Jewish prayer book, which she had taken with her and had put in the most accessible spot in an unlocked suitcase.</sentence><sentence id="2149">I do not know -- these people were rather nosey, I do not know whether they ever opened the suitcase, whether they saw it.</sentence><sentence id="2150">The prayer book was in German, this was for people who, like many Jewish women of the time, didn't read Hebrew, and it was quite obvious what it was.</sentence><sentence id="2151">If they had looked, they didn't breathe a word to anyone, which was rather characteristic of many people.</sentence><sentence id="2152">Their -- I don't think they were really out of sympathy with Hitler but they drew the <span class="DLF">line</span> at not really wanting to be involved in any -- anything hostile -- a -- any</sentence><sentence id="2154">9 hostile actions against Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2155">There were Sudeten Germans, not all Sudeten Germans -- Schindler was a S-Sudeten German too.</sentence><sentence id="2156">Not all of them were -- were as decent as Schindler [indecipherable] these -- I don't think these people were anywhere near it.</sentence><sentence id="2157">But it's another example of people who could have done us in and chose not to.</sentence><sentence id="2158">So anyway, we were welcome to stay there only as long as -- as the bacon lasted.</sentence><sentence id="2159">When that was eaten up it was intimated to us, well you better find yourself some <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2160">We went to the appropriate <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and was -- appeared there as Volksdeutsche and at first they weren't too re-responsive, but my mother began to [indecipherable] and was very good at making a good impression and before long she had persuaded them that they should get us a furnished roo -- room somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="2161">And they had -- it turned out they -- they had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was ostensibly reserved for somebody else, it was in a very nice part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and they probably didn't want your average, sort of eastern European refugee there, but after looking my mother over, and me, we looked respectable, so they as-assigned that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to us.</sentence><sentence id="2162">Well, there was actually -- there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, but then they gave us special permits to buy some very cheap, sort of very e- emergency, essentially unpainted <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2163">Some straw for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span>, little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, just the bare necessities.</sentence><sentence id="2164">This was late "44.</sentence><sentence id="2165">Large parts of Europe were certainly living under quite difficult conditions, but the Germans still managed to look after their own.</sentence><sentence id="2166">We were now considered their own, so we were able as -- as refugees, were able to get at least the minimal necessities for life, as well as [indecipherable] halfway adequate ration cards.</sentence><sentence id="2167">Well, the next problem of course, was that I was 18 years old at the time, I was not in uniform, I [indecipherable] this was most unusual situation.</sentence><sentence id="2168">The German army should have come after me, they never did.</sentence><sentence id="2169">But f-fortunately, something prevented me from -- fr-from being put in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="2170">Now, we -- my mother and I sort of had to go shopping until we got settled, and I kept telling</sentence><sentence id="2172">0 her, please don't walk so fast.</sentence><sentence id="2173">And the problem wasn't that she was walking too fast, it was just that my heart was giving out.</sentence><sentence id="2174">This is a complication that often happens when adults get diphtheria, that they get myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle.</sentence><sentence id="2175">So, before long I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and one of our neighbors was a doctor, she came up, listened to my heart, shook her head and said you better get yourself to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2176">So I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for two months, bedridden with myocarditis.</sentence><sentence id="2177">And meanwhile the <span class="BUILDING">labor office</span> had decided that they couldn't put me in the army, but somehow it didn't seem right that an 18 year old should not be in uniform, and they had just the ideal job for me.</sentence><sentence id="2178">I was to be a -- a guard at a -- a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, guarding prisoners of war and forced laborers.</sentence><sentence id="2179">These we-were armed guards with -- with rifles, and who were -- whose job it was to get the last ounce of effort out of these poor, undernourished people.</sentence><sentence id="2180">And a number of them were killed after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2181">So while I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I kept getting one summons after another to appear there, and to b-be sort of signed up for this par- paramilitary unit.</sentence><sentence id="2182">I always write them, sorry, I'm still bedridden, still in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2183">Soon as I got out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they again want to put me in that -- so -- in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, and I said sorry, but I am s-still quite sick and I c -- I'm not yet ready to work.</sentence><sentence id="2184">So they sent me to one of their doctors who told me just to -- to do a few bends and then checked my pulse, which was well over 200 by then.</sentence><sentence id="2185">So he said okay, you -- you're unfit to work, I'll exempt you from work until May 15".</sentence><sentence id="2186">Well, the war ended on May eighth, very conveniently, so I had no further trouble from that source.</sentence><sentence id="2187">And while I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there were several air raids, one was in our -- our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but the others were generally to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2188">And I was there the night that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> was bombed, and it was an air raid, we didn't hear any bombs falling, or any anti-aircraft artillery, so we just stepped out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to look, and we saw flashes of light at the horizon in the direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2189">And there was a <span class="DLF">mountain range</span> between us, so we couldn't see too much, but we saw</sentence><sentence id="2191">1 these white flashes, then gradually they were replaced by a red glow which rose higher and higher in the <span class="DLF">sky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2192">And realizing what was happening there, it was rather scary.</sentence><sentence id="2193">And of course, afterwards, you know, that night 60,000 people got killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2194">The Germans still feel this was a war crime, it was done with the British and the Royal Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="2195">So we were not in great danger, there were a few more bombings, in one of the [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> 500 people got killed.</sentence><sentence id="2196">There were also bombings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, but the closest danger was that once or twice a bomb fell within about a hundred meters from us, but they were small bombs, and other than breaking <span class="DLF">windows</span>, nothing much happened.</sentence><sentence id="2197">Well, we were just listening to the -- to th-the radio and managed to get the BBC, and we knew pretty well what was happening, and our German neighbors also realized what was happening, and -- and by April they -- they knew the war was lost and they were sort of wondering how to prepare themselves for the next [indecipherable] change that was emi -- imminent.</sentence><sentence id="2198">They -- one sort of triumph that came our way is that the neighbors on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> were perfectly decent people, but since they lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor apartment</span>, it was their duty to -- to hoist the German flag on official occasions, and they decided at this point that this flag with a swastika was s-somewhat a incriminating material and they want to get rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="2199">They decided to burn it, but they couldn't burn it in their own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because people could have looked in through the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2200">So we were on -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and they asked if they could come and burn the flag in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and we were absolutely delighted.</sentence><sentence id="2201">Something else that I -- I me-meant to mention is that -- is that living in the si -- in constant danger and not knowing exactly when the police would come to take us away and what would happen after that, we thought it was a good idea to prepare ourselves and get some poison.</sentence><sentence id="2202">So, as a budding chemist I found a recipe for making potassium cyanide and I cooked up a batch for myself and my mother and we carried it with us until sometime after the</sentence><sentence id="2204">2 end of the war, until we could get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian occupation zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2205">Fortunately we never had to use it.</sentence><sentence id="2206">The stuff is vile tasting and it's a bit ironic that as far as taste is concerned, the -- the gas, hydrogen cyanide at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is -- is less disagreeable than -- than swallowing potassium cyanide, but the difference is, if you decide to kill yourself with potassium cyanide, that is preferable to being killed against your wishes.</sentence><sentence id="2207">And so to us this would have been definitely the -- the lesser evil.</sentence><sentence id="2208">Then we f -- about a week before the end of war, we heard that American troops had -- were within -- within about 50 kilometers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kometau</span> where we lived, and the Russian troops were still 300 kilometers away, and we knew nothing of the Yalta agreement.</sentence><sentence id="2209">So we thought that the race goes to the swiftest and expected the Americans to show up any day.</sentence><sentence id="2210">And then nothing happened, the Russians kept advancing and the Americans were standing pat.</sentence><sentence id="2211">So it was once again a case of Mohammed going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2212">Suddenly the war was over, it was Mar -- M-May the eighth.</sentence><sentence id="2213">M -- in the last few days of the war we had seen long processions of people on foot, m-most of the time from the east.</sentence><sentence id="2214">It was a strange mixture of people, the occasional <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmate in striped garb, the occasional SS man, guarding him, or just looking out for -- for his own interest.</sentence><sentence id="2215">I particularly remember one Jew who -- who really looked pretty awful.</sentence><sentence id="2216">He was clearly undernourished, but from his face you could tell that the man was close to losing his mind.</sentence><sentence id="2217">I don't know what became of him.</sentence><sentence id="2218">And it was pathetic.</sentence><sentence id="2219">There were some others that didn't look quite so bad, but this was a s -- a very sad case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2331">Q: So what you're describing is death marches from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> west -- going west, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2332">A: It was -- it was a mic -- a strange mixture.</sentence><sentence id="2333">There were a lot of civilians, there were some s- soldiers in uniform, and then the occasional camp inmate.</sentence><sentence id="2334">Presumably he wasn't free to go where he wanted, there was -- was a guard nearby, but these weren't large contingents of refugees, this was not one of -- all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates.</sentence><sentence id="2335">This was not one of the main <span class="DLF">routes</span> of the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2344">3 death marches, but there was just a sprinkling of these people.</sentence><sentence id="2345">I -- I don't know where they came from, so on.</sentence><sentence id="2346">Well, came the -- the eighth of May.</sentence><sentence id="2347">Of course we had been delighted before to hear that Hitler had committed suicide, although that's not the way the story was told.</sentence><sentence id="2348">But then, on the eighth of May the ma -- the war was over, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had surrendered, my mother went out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and an -- an old lady asked her just what is all this commotion about?</sentence><sentence id="2349">People are so fa -- hustling and bustling.</sentence><sentence id="2350">And ma -- my mother said, "The war is over." "</sentence><sentence id="2351">Oh," this lady said, "wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2352">So we won." "</sentence><sentence id="2353">No," my mother said, "<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> lost." "</sentence><sentence id="2354">How dare you say that?</sentence><sentence id="2355">I'm going to report you to the Gestapo."</sentence><sentence id="2356">Well, it's remarkable that on the eighth of May, that there was still a German woman who didn't realize that the war -- that they were losing the war.</sentence><sentence id="2357">That in itself is a -- is an interesting topic, how a number of people clung to the hope that they might still win the war.</sentence><sentence id="2358">Course, Goebbels had all this propaganda about these secret weapons, that he had -- one -- he said at one point that he had seen the new s-secret, retaliatory weapons and they made the blood freeze in your veins.</sentence><sentence id="2359">Well, it was a complete bluff, there was no such thing.</sentence><sentence id="2360">After the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">V-2</span> they have nothing more.</sentence><sentence id="2361">But now the problem was the war was over and there was still no sign of either Americans or Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2362">And then we realized the Russians were advancing and we had better get out.</sentence><sentence id="2363">And in <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was -- where the Americans were supposed to be with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2364">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and -- just to see what kind of transportation there was, and lo and behold there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross train</span> with so-some French prisoners of war, a former Lithuanian p-prime minister who had been kept political prisoner in some <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>, the Belgian priests, the Crown Prince of <span class="COUNTRY">Montenegro</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2365">So, a weird assortment.</sentence><sentence id="2366">Anyway, we s -- my mother so fast talked her way onto that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were allowed to get on.</sentence><sentence id="2367">And so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> traveled a few kilometers, stopped for a few hours, travel again.</sentence><sentence id="2368">One <span class="BUILDING">station</span> on the way I saw an SS man in full regalia, marching, parading up and down.</sentence><sentence id="2369">The war had been over for two days but this was still</sentence><sentence id="2371">4 <span class="REGION">unoccupied territory</span>, and it was scary to -- to see this man still completely self confident, as if he were on top of the world.</sentence><sentence id="2372">Anyway.</sentence><sentence id="2373">Then, a few kilometers further the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and then there's -- I forget who it was, came and announced that all civilians and so on, refugees, get out, you have to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2374">Only the people who are authorized by the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> can stay.</sentence><sentence id="2375">So we were 10 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span>, took our suitcases and just walked the last 10 kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="2376">It was not a very good thing for my heart because turned out that I had a good relapse at the time, so -- which kept me bedridden in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span> for a few more months.</sentence><sentence id="2377">But we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span> in the afternoon, walked around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, saw an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American Jeep</span> and were delighted.</sentence><sentence id="2378">Went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and we managed to find a refuge with -- with our neighbors who had taken us there, they had some friends, we managed to sleep in someone's <span

of report there and say who we are and just ask for protection.</sentence><sentence id="2380">The next morning we were just -- we walked downstairs and a woman stopped us in the <span

collectors.</sentence><sentence id="2382">Some of them would wear as many as five wristwatches proudly on the wrist.</sentence><sentence id="2383">So what had happened is that [indecipherable] the Yalta agreement, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was divided between Americans and Russians at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2384">We were on the wrong, sort of, bank of the <span

you wait a few days until we -- we have established control over the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then come back again.</sentence><sentence id="2389">Well, it turned out there was no coming back because they pulled out</sentence><sentence id="2391">5 the next day.</sentence><sentence id="2392">They turned out the -- turned the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> over to the Russians, and so once again we were in the clutches of the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2393">And once again it was a great convenience to have -- to be sick and not being sort of fit

operation so that you -- it won't be obvious that you -- you're circumcised.</sentence><sentence id="2873">And if they ask you, then say you had phimosis, which is of a -- when the foreskin gets very

his life.</sentence><sentence id="2877">And it's -- again it's a case where a German had the opportunity to save somebody's life.</sentence><sentence id="2878">He had gotten to know this man a little bit, and apparently wanted to save his life.</sentence><sentence id="2879">One incident, it's a little bit out of sequence.</sentence><sentence id="2880">Right after the end of war in <span

id="2883">It's all because of the -- the Jewish conspiracy.</sentence><sentence id="2884">I didn't say anything one way or another, I didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="2885">I didn't feel like turning him in to the police.</sentence><sentence id="2886">And I've asked myself occasionally, was that the right response?</sentence><sentence id="2887">He was basically a pleasant young

occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, within weeks they started publishing Latvian translations of the protocols of -- of the elders of <span

opened, but it wasn't up to me to turn him in.</sentence><sentence id="2892">Quite possibly this was the feeling that a number of people had who could have acted against Jews, and again didn't want to get their hands dirty.</sentence><sentence id="2893">Th -- somehow, when you know a -- a person, unless you a ver -- a very -- somehow a -- full of hate against another group, when you've got to know

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3018">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3019">Yes, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="3020">Part of it was the practical reason, if you could say that you are Jewish, in a way this ab-absolves you from all suspicion of being a Latvian with some things to hide and</sentence><sentence id="3022">0 so on, or a German, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3023">That was practical, but in -- in part it -- it just seemed natural.</sentence><sentence id="3024">I didn't feel especially close to Jews from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3025">I did belong to this Federation of Latvian Jews, it was called, and I di -- discovered that there were -- were several differences in -- in -- in the -- even in the Yiddish, of Lithuanian Jews, Polish Jews and so forth, and the mentality and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3026">That -- Latvian Jews were terribly naive compared to Hungarian or Romanian Jews, who were very, very wise in the -- the ways of the world.</sentence><sentence id="3027">So yes, but primarily I was -- cer- certainly I consider myself a Jew, and this -- I had sort of concealed this fact for years and now it was out in the open.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Edward Anders on February 28", 1997.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3223">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3224">Well, one of my first impressions, of course, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, which is unique.</sentence><sentence id="3225">And we arrived there in -- in June, it was a good heat wave, which was also unique, a new experience.</sentence><sentence id="3226">There was -- the next experience was I found myself in the Catskills of all <span class="NPIP">places</span>, in a-a very low budget <span class="BUILDING">vegetarian hotel</span> belonging to a very distant relative, and I was pressed into service as a waiter -- I was a lousy waiter, incidentally.</sentence><sentence id="3227">And the problem was that this was a place where people went to lose weight, who had -- people who had eaten more than enough all year and they were delighted to be in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were getting sort of low calorie diets.</sentence><sentence id="3230">5 And -- and I had not really had too much to eat in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the last two weeks or so in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before we -- and i-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> before we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3231">The people there who ran the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> realized that they could steal all the food they wanted, the -- the people who managed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3232">That people, being this far along with the immigration process didn't want to make any waves and they wouldn't complain.</sentence><sentence id="3233">So the food was very inadequate in -- in quantity and quality.</sentence><sentence id="3234">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> most of us were seasick and couldn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="3235">So we arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and one thing I really wanted is lots of good food.</sentence><sentence id="3236">Wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span>, this <span class="BUILDING">vegetarian place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3237">Anyways, I [indecipherable] going to [indecipherable] anyway we -- people gave us fairly decent tips, it was, of course, a low budget <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, but maybe by standards of posher <span class="NPIP">places</span> it [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="3238">But it -- it was enough for me then to pay th -- to pay tuition, I applied to several <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> and it turned out that for most of them I -- I was sort of neither fish nor fowl.</sentence><sentence id="3239">I was too far along to qualify for an undergraduate degree, and I was not far enough along to -- to go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, the one <span class="NPIP">place</span> that took me was Columbia.</sentence><sentence id="3240">They had a big, sort of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of general studies, which was a catchall for people going to <span class="BUILDING">night classes</span>, or people that again, didn't fit the regular system, that they want -- just wanted to look over.</sentence><sentence id="3241">And then after first semester my grades were very good and so they were quite pleased to put me immediately into <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, and I was fine.</sentence><sentence id="3242">One of my other strong impressions of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, an early impression was -- is -- it was, d-during the Korean war, and Harry Truman had decided to sort of -- to take over the steel industry because there was a strike.</sentence><sentence id="3243">And it was during the war, he felt it was wrong to strike.</sentence><sentence id="3244">And then a lowly <span class="COUNTRY">US</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3245">district judge overruled him, and said it was illegal to intervene, the strike was legitimate.</sentence><sentence id="3246">And to me this was a tremendously impressive demonstration of what the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> was all about, that in the European tradition it's unthinkable that a third level judge would rule against his president, especially the president of the almighty <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3247">So that was really a wonderful object</sentence><sentence id="3249">6 lesson.</sentence><sentence id="3250">And there were many others, and there were quite a few things I liked about the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, and very much impressed me, and you think living the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> makes you -- opens your eyes to a lot of things that you previously weren't aware of, not that I approve of everything that goes on in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">USS</span>.,</sentence><sentence id="3251">but it -- it was a -- a very great experience, and I was certainly very glad that I -- that I was allowed to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S</span>..</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3283">Q: Can you just very briefly kind of summarize your life after the war in terms of schooling, your career, marriage, kids, just briefly summarize it for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3285">A: Yeah, sure.</sentence><sentence id="3286"><span class="BUILDING">Schooling</span>, I -- from my second semester on I was in <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, and was admitted to the PhD. program, got a fellowship.</sentence><sentence id="3287">I wasn't eligible for a government fellowship, so I got an industrial fellowship.</sentence><sentence id="3288">Got a teaching assistantship, and managed to get my degree.</sentence><sentence id="3289">My first academic job was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3290">I thought all <span class="BUILDING">American universities</span> were like <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3291">They weren't.</sentence><sentence id="3292"><span class="COUNTRY">Illinois</span> was a very conservative place, run by old men, and they, in the division that I was in, they only had two kinds of faculty, those who had been there for 25 years or longer, and those who had been there for a year or less, nothing in between.</sentence><sentence id="3293">And the young men were sort of very much put in their <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3294">It turns out I didn't have the right to choose the textbook I wanted, the department chairman had written a textbook, and oh ye -- in principle I was free to use it, but in practice I wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="3295">And so on, there were a number of things that I didn't like, so I was delighted after a year and a half, I got an offer from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span>, which was very much like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> in that respect, young faculty members had the same privileges as old ones.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3307">Q: Your -- the <span class="REGION">area</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3308">What <span class="DLF">field</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3311">A: I was trained as a chemist, actually as a radio chemist, having to do with radioactivity, which is now an unpopular subject.</sentence><sentence id="3312">And I -- while still a student, I fell in love with meteorites.</sentence><sentence id="3313">I took a</sentence><sentence id="3315">7 course in geochemistry and one day the professor brought some meteorites to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and passed them around.</sentence><sentence id="3316">And this was several years before Sputnik, before space travel and so on, and I was f -- th-thought it was tremendously romantic that here are these bits of rock or metal that come from hundreds of millions of miles away, from where no man has ever been, or had much hope of ever being.</sentence><sentence id="3317">That were older than anything, any rock on the earth by quite a bit, and that you could study in the <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span> and you could do measurements on, it would tell you something about the origin of the solar system, the earliest [indecipherable] the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3318">It was fascinating.</sentence><sentence id="3319">I -- I want to do work in this <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3320">It was love at first sight, really.</sentence><sentence id="3321">And unfortunately I had a tiger by the tail, I had been -- somehow I had been persuaded by a Nobel laureate to look for one of the last missing elements in nature.</sentence><sentence id="3322">There were four <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">periodic table</span> where there ought to be an element that hadn't yet been found, and some forms of this element had been produced artificially, but nothing had been found in nature, and he persuaded me that I should look for it by some modern techniques, that there was a good chance that the people that looked for it before had missed it.</sentence><sentence id="3323">And so I -- I spent the next seven years on that, which was a wild goose chase.</sentence><sentence id="3324">And I had to solve the problem one way or another, in the end I solved it when -- I had some -- I kept getting experiments which suggested it -- th-that the results were not good enough to publish, and not bad enough to quit, always were in between.</sentence><sentence id="3325">And finally I managed to repeat an experiment I'd done earlier and show that the earlier data were wrong, that the new result, which was really negative, was hundred times more sensitive than the old one, and so completely overruled it and I felt that I was now a free man, I could work on meteorites.</sentence><sentence id="3326">So I did that the rest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="3327">And I worked on lunar rocks and various other things, and had a certain amount of recognition, and I had fun.</sentence><sentence id="3328">And th-the only good thing that happened at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Illinois</span> is | met my wife.</sentence><sentence id="3329">Both of us had just newly arrived, she was a Canadian who had just recently</sentence><sentence id="3331">8 moved to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, she was a dietician at the girl's residence hall, and I was newly a-arrived instructor.</sentence><sentence id="3332">And there was Lincoln's birthday, which is a big deal in <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="3333">They had a party for grad students, faculty and staff, and she went there as staff, I went there as faculty.</sentence><sentence id="3334">It was a dance, I sort of looked over the girls that had -- were there, and decided none of them were interesting, so I positioned myself near the <span class="DLF">door</span> to intercept any good looking ones that came in, so | -- I -- before anybody else got to them.</sentence><sentence id="3335">Anyway, I did intercept her, and the rest is -- is history.</sentence><sentence id="3336">And we had two children, and -- and a very happy marriage.</sentence><sentence id="3337">My mother turned out to be extremely difficult, because she had focused all her emotions on me.</sentence><sentence id="3338">I was the only survivor, and as a psychiatrist later explained to me that I had fu-fulfilled all the roles of son and husband and protector and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="3339">And she kept saying for years that she wanted me to get married, but when it actually came to it she was very much against it.</sentence><sentence id="3340">Also, she had suddenly ha -- she had also really detached herself pretty well from Judaism, but when the time came to talk about the wedding and so on, she suddenly rediscovered her roots, objected to any kind of a church wedding.</sentence><sentence id="3341">My wife is Presbyterian, and so my mother was -- was very difficult and we had endless troubles with her.</sentence><sentence id="3342">She lived with us, we had -- I felt that all the years we'd lived together, contrary to all the advice you normally get, can't very well push her out.</sentence><sentence id="3343">And then, at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> she attempted suicide.</sentence><sentence id="3344">She went -- went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">psychiatric ward</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and was under psychiatric treatment for quite awhile.</sentence><sentence id="3345">I paid all the bills and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3346">And -- and gradually we reached an <span class="INT_SPACE">accommodation</span>, but we never knew where we stood, because she was schizophrenic, and part of the time she was a very charming, very sweet person, and parts of the time she was just a paranoid devil.</sentence><sentence id="3347">And it continued like this, she made life especially difficult for our daughter, was a very dear child.</sentence><sentence id="3348">As one psychiatrist explained, that she hates women in general.</sentence><sentence id="3349">She hates my wife, she hated my daughter.</sentence><sentence id="3350">It's -- you know, it's -- don't quite know why, but it -</sentence><sentence id="3352">9 - it was a problem.</sentence><sentence id="3353">When she began to get Alzheimer's, many people have a personality change for the worse, hers was for the better, she became very mellow, we could do no wrong.</sentence><sentence id="3354">The early stages of Alzheimer's, no matter what we did, it was fine, it was -- she was at peace with herself.</sentence><sentence id="3355">But it was not easy.</sentence><sentence id="3356">But it -- in a way it -- it made my -- my wife and me closer, and also it -- perhaps the experiences were -- were traumatic for my -- my daughter, she went through a stage where she was anorectic and so on and she needed counseling, but she's -- she's fine now.</sentence><sentence id="3357">But my mother had treated her quite badly and my -- my wife insisted the children had to see the grandmother every Saturday morning and not realizing what kind of mental torture my daughter was going through, especially.</sentence><sentence id="3358">So anyway, that's past.</sentence><sentence id="3359">But I've had a happy life, I worked very hard all my life, but I had a happy life in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S</span>.. Relations to Judaism, so very gradually sort of cooled off in the sense that, I have good Jewish friends, but I don't have any ties to the religion.</sentence><sentence id="3360">We raised our children -- of course there had to be some sort of compromises with my mother, but the understanding was that they would not be baptized.</sentence><sentence id="3361">They were told about their background early on.</sentence><sentence id="3362">We lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> where it was actually a matter of prestige to be a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3363">And so they have no hang-ups about their background and we felt that they should choose for themselves, and whatever they chose would be fine with us.</sentence><sentence id="3364">As it happened, I think one married a Catholic, the other one married a Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="3365">But they are not particularly ashamed of their background, they can talk freely about it.</sentence><sentence id="3366">And to me this, of course, has -- brings up the question that I asked myself many years ago.</sentence><sentence id="3367">When this outstanding German architect who I met during the war, when he said he would not consider it unfortunate if the German people ceased to exist as a nation after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3368">Said, they have done so m -- so many bad things as a nation, he said he doesn't want the individual people to be destroyed, but if they ceased to [indecipherable] as a nation it wouldn't be so bad.</sentence><sentence id="3369">And to me this was a bit shocking,</sentence><sentence id="3371">0 but then over the years I've asked myself -- nationalism has caused a lot of problems in this world, and each nation, each group should ask itself, what are the quintessential qualities that we want to preserve?</sentence><sentence id="3372">In <span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span> I think there is the respect for learning, which has been extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="3373">The strong sense of justice and of siding with the underdog, which again is very admirable.</sentence><sentence id="3374">The Jewish sense of humor.</sentence><sentence id="3375">There -- there are a number of qualities and they really should be universal qualities.</sentence><sentence id="3376">Maybe the Jews have a special sort of aptitude for it, the special responsibility to propagate these qualities and I'm glad in a way that there's a state of Israel and Jews no longer have to be pushed around, and so on, and it -- it's only proper that those who feel uncomfortable where they're living, that they should be able to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and -- and live ina 100 percent Jewish society.</sentence><sentence id="3377">But to some extent I must say, I was -- I -- the Holocaust has left its scars.</sentence><sentence id="3378">The -- I did not want my children to be -- ever to go through it again.</sentence><sentence id="3379">I've occasionally asked myself, could another Hitler arise in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3380">I've -- I first asked myself this question before my children were born.</sentence><sentence id="3381">And I saw a movie, "Judgment at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>", and my wife and I sort of went for a long, long walk after, late in the night after the movie and we asked ourself, what is it that prevents the U.S. from getting a Hitler?</sentence><sentence id="3382">And I realized one thing is a free press, and another one is an outspoken intelligentsia.</sentence><sentence id="3383">And that's very important, when we have somebody like Nixon and so on, there was no lack of protest from the intelligentsia, from the press.</sentence><sentence id="3384">We sometimes get annoyed at the press, but as long as we have a free press, there is hope.</sentence><sentence id="3385">One can go on philosophizing about this theme, but m-my own feeling toward religion is I don't like to associate with any foreign religion.</sentence><sentence id="3386">In my research, of course, I have a fair amount to do with astronomy, and to me looking at the <span class="DLF">sky</span> is one of the most -- night sky, is one of the most religious experiences.</sentence><sentence id="3387">Just to realize that -- the vastness of the <span class="NPIP">universe</span>, and to read about biology and to just know how intricately designed organisms are.</sentence><sentence id="3388">And I am not taking <span class="NPIP">sides</span></sentence><sentence id="3390">1 whether there was a -- God created various living forms and so on, or whether this all, you know, is just by evolution, what role God, or some combination of both, I think it's just -- nature is a very wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I find it perfectly possible to believe in a deity that presides over it all, maybe with minimal intervention.</sentence><sentence id="3391">I have trouble believing in a personal God that is -- is petty and keeps track of how many times a day I say my prayers and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3392">And I-I'm -- I'm comfortable with that.</sentence><sentence id="3393">It's -- it's certainly not conventional Judaism, and I'm not sure that it deserves any label.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3486">Q: But that ta -- ta -- your brand of faith grew out of your experiences.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3488">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3490">Q: I mean, had the war not happened, you would have -- could have still been worshipping daily in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3492">A: Probably not.</sentence><sentence id="3493">I was 13 -- of course at <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> -- Bar Mitzvah, I did this from 13 to 15, and I think Ihave grown a lot since, I've asked myself a lot of questions.</sentence><sentence id="3494">Also, someday I would have had to come to terms why my father didn't belong to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, and just what was the proper dose of religion, the proper form of religion.</sentence><sentence id="3495">I mean it -- so long as you were treated as -- as a -- as a Jew, as a almost foreign element by society, well if society defines you as -- as -- as a Jew, then you don't have much choice, you -- you make the best of it.</sentence><sentence id="3496">But Judaism, of course, as I learned only after leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, that there are many brands of Judaism, Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3497">I find a lot of -- a lot of appealing elements in Reform Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="3498">But for awhile I would actually go to -- to some <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and go to some <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> and so on and I would listen.</sentence><sentence id="3499">And the one thing I found myself looking for was humility.</sentence><sentence id="3500">And really the only place I found it was at the <span class="BUILDING">Unitarian church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3501">Now, I haven't s -- set foot in a <span class="BUILDING">Unitarian church</span> in decades and I can't properly call myself a Unitarian, but there was humility and tolerance, and a sort of attitude,</sentence><sentence id="3503">2 well, we are not all sure we have the right answers.</sentence><sentence id="3504">We have no dogma.</sentence><sentence id="3505">We are all trying to get to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, perhaps by different routes, and think we're -- one definition is reverent agnosticism.</sentence><sentence id="3506">And I go to a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant church</span> and I find this us versus them, and we have a monopoly on the right religion.</sentence><sentence id="3507">I go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish temple</span>, I hear the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="3508">And to me there is so much we don't know, and I think it's wonderful to believe in a God, but even that should be optional.</sentence><sentence id="3509">But then to start with precise attributes of the God, and -- and precise dogmas and so forth, especially if it's that we have the right answers and all the other people are wrong, I find this more and more objectionable, and that would have hit me even if I s-stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3530">Q: When you were in tight spots during the war, did you pray?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3532">A: Actually, I still do.</sentence><sentence id="3533">Though I didn't pray when I was in -- well, I suppose I must have prayed a few times when I was in tight spots, but I don't -- I-I don't think that I prayed in the sen -- I don't think I prayed in the sense that I expected -- I was in a tight <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and I expected my prayer to result in -- in a quick solution to my problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3536">Q: But you prayed because it was a comfort, because you needed to do something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3538">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3540">Q: And your mother carried this prayer book with her, but that was probably sentimental as much as religious, I would think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3542">A: Yes, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3543">Well, yes, wa -- she's na -- I th -- think with -- with her it was -- it was both.</sentence><sentence id="3544">She certainly read the prayer book and she would get some comfort from it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3548">Q: Let me ask you a few other things.</sentence><sentence id="3549">When you were living through the war years, did you find having your mother with you a source of strength, or a responsibility that made things more difficult for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3555">A: Mainly, I would say a source of strength.</sentence><sentence id="3556">There were times when I felt that we had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="3557">For instance, I decided that we had to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, and she didn't want to for awhile, and she got -- she didn't want me to get th-the famous I.D. card for her.</sentence><sentence id="3558">There were certain decisions where we had to argue things out and of course it was a little difficult for her to accept that this -- this child has now grown up to be a young man and maybe he has more [indecipherable] than -- than I do.</sentence><sentence id="3559">So we were a team.</sentence><sentence id="3560">We did have our occasional friction, but as long as there were just the two of us, and bef-before my wife appeared in the picture and so on there, we generally managed to straighten things out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3567">Q: When you got over here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, did you finally feel safe, did you trust everyone, or is that something that's -- one has to learn gradually -- relearn?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3589">A: I think it has taught me not to generalize about people, and th-there are really two factors that pushed me in that direction.</sentence><sentence id="3590">One of them was that before the German occupation, we thought that just because my -- my father was a very decent businessman, he had some letters from his German customers commending him for having warned them about some unfair practices of some -- some other business people, that no matter what -- whether there were any legitimate complaints that the anti-Semites had about certain Jews, that my father had a-a-an excellent record and that he would be treated accordingly, that they would not -- not treat everybody the same regardless of what you -- you've done as a person.</sentence><sentence id="3591">And similarly Germans, I've learned very quickly that there were some -- some awful Germans, some monsters, and there were some angels, and lots of in between, and -- and the same with Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="3592">And so I began to realize that it's absolutely wrong to generalize.</sentence><sentence id="3593">I -- I don't like to say the Germans, or the -- the Jews, or the Lat-Latvians.</sentence><sentence id="3594">I tend to view people as individuals.</sentence><sentence id="3595">So that's one important lesson that I learned.</sentence><sentence id="3596">And the other thing is that I feel that sort of ethnic religious labels are some of the less important descriptives of a person.</sentence><sentence id="3597">The story that I like that illustrates this very well, a number of years ago, there was a conductor named Dean Dixon, an American.</sentence><sentence id="3598">When he first gave a concert in Europe -- he spent much of his career in Europe, the newspapers would write about the American Negro conductor, Dean Dixon.</sentence><sentence id="3599">After the second concert it was the American conductor Dean Dixon.</sentence><sentence id="3600">After the third one it was the conductor Dean Dixon.</sentence><sentence id="3601">They should have</sentence><sentence id="3603">5 started with the third concert right away, because to s-size up Dean Dixon the most important thing is a conductor.</sentence><sentence id="3604">He was a good conductor, he was a mediocre conductor but he obviously knows a lot about music and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3605">Prefers certain kinds of music and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3606">It's less important that he is Am-American, music is fairly universal.</sentence><sentence id="3607">Still less important that he is black.</sentence><sentence id="3608">In the end all of these factors have to be considered, but they went at them in the reverse order.</sentence><sentence id="3609">And I want to be known primarily as -- as Edward Anders, who has done such and such with his life, done some good things and some bad things, made some mistakes, had certain quirks and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3610">I have [indecipherable] done research in certain <span class="REGION">area</span>, I've done this or that, and it's considerably less important that -- that I am an American, or that I'm a Jew by birth.</sentence><sentence id="3611">So, to me these are less im-important because there's such a tremendous variety of Americans, there's such a tremendous variety of Jews, and to start with either my American citizenship or my Jewish background and put that as the number one label on me, I -- I think it's putting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> before the horse.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3637">Q: How else do you think these experiences have affected you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3639">A: Strangely enough, not all that much in the sense of long term or short term damage.</sentence><sentence id="3640">The only recognizable quirk that I have is I don't like anybody barging into my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> in the middle of the night, and we had to train our children when they had a bad dream they were welcome to run, but to our <span class="DLF">bedroom door</span>, and they could knock, or they could otherwise make -- make a sound, we had the intercom anyway, to their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, but they were not to barge into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3641">They grew up normally in spite of this restriction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3645">Q: And you told them, at some point, about all your experiences, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3646">A: Yeah, I think when -- when they're s-small you don't go into un-unnecessary detail, it's just this is a rule and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="3647">And since then, of course, they've learned t-to -- little by little.</sentence></p></dialogue>
