How shall I say it?</sentence><sentence id="44">A very comfortable, not luxurious life...I can't say that...but we had a very lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">As

upset that I didn't even take my mother in...with her we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rental car</span> that time.</sentence><sentence id="53">We went specifically on my mother's request to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">She wanted to see the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> once more, so we went in 77.</sentence><sentence id="55">And we went to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and it was unfriendly, dark and not clean so we didn't go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="56">When...when I went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> is when I went with my husband, Norman.</sentence><sentence id="57">In 1986 I think or 85 we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">I wanted to show him.</sentence><sentence id="59">We came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence

there.</sentence><sentence id="62">To the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">It was not a <span class="BUILDING">private home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">And it's lovely <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">It's a very well known <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">It's called .</sentence><sentence id="68">And nowadays when we went there with my husband, there are some <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> or delegations in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, in that <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">So we lived in that <span class="DLF">street</span> and ____ was another <span class="DLF">street</span>, corner.</sentence><sentence id="70">And so when I went there it seemed the same in a way again, but I opened the main <span class="DLF">door</span> and inside it was filthy, and the main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was either walled in or changed so I couldn't go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">It was so disappointing for me and I was so sad that I told my husband, "Let's go.</sentence><sentence id="72">It's no use to look for something."</sentence><sentence id="73">But in my time, it was a very beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">It had four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and I think had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and had a little maid...for the maid.</sentence><sentence id="75">We had a permanent woman who lived with us for many, many years and then later on changed to other one who also lived with us for many, many years.</sentence><sentence id="76">And...uh...we had...and I described this...not in this paper what I left but I made a tape on this actually at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and I lived there really remember.</sentence><sentence id="77">I remember the curtains were all with strawberry velvet and in the summertime my mother took it off and changed it for a summer curtains that the sun shouldn't eat it up.</sentence><sentence id="78">And we had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">music room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">One of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> was kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">music room</span> because my mother played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> beautifully and my father played the harp, which is very unusual that the man plays the harp, but he played the harp.</sentence><sentence id="80">Everybody else in the family, including me, not anymore, including me, we ...we sang.</sentence><sentence id="81">We loved to sing.</sentence><sentence id="82">My mother had a very pretty voice.</sentence><sentence id="83">My father had a lovely baritone, so we used to play in that <span class="INT_SPACE">music room</span> and friends of my father came and they sang so we had very lovely memories on the holidays.</sentence><sentence id="84">Hanukkah or Yom Kippur or Pasah, and even Christmas I have to say.</sentence><sentence id="85">We had a wonderful event even on Christmas time.</sentence><sentence id="86">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was a very Catholic country.</sentence><sentence id="87">Everybody had Christmas trees and all this, so everybody was even holiday feeling in that time, winter.</sentence><sentence id="88">And we had...I remember my...the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>... my mother's and father's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was...was in that time, probably was personal when they got married, was light pink and had all lace and so, the children...my brother and myself, we were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, never separated.</sentence><sentence id="89">I don't remember when we were separated.</sentence><sentence id="90">And then later my...my brother, my little brother was born and...uh...he...1 don't know whether he was in a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">I don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="92">But it was a lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">We had...in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was...all the heating were with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">I don't know what they <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">I don't know how they call it.</sentence><sentence id="96">Beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="97">Each <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> had a different color.</sentence><sentence id="98">One was brown.</sentence><sentence id="99">The other one was pink.</sentence><sentence id="100">So we liked to sit around there.</sentence><sentence id="101">And so the regular life was very peaceful.</sentence><sentence id="102">My father worked, and we went to...later on <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">I remember only the years from my own life when I went to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">And interesting enough I remember that my late brother when to the same <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> a year before I did, and my brother, George, much later...it was already almost war time, he went to that same <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> which was called Princess Julienne.</sentence><sentence id="105">It was a Dutch Reform private school.</sentence><sentence id="106">The Dutch Reform Church private school in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and it still it exists because I took my husband and showed him and said, "Look, how small it looks and..." It was beautiful in my time because it was well kept.</sentence><sentence id="107">Now it wasn't anymore...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> well kept.</sentence><sentence id="108">So I went there to see so after I attended that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my brother, my late brother, after 4 years...we had 4 years <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span>, he went to a so-called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">They were not called <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span>. _</sentence><sentence id="110">or <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">He went to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which was very near where we lived. _,</sentence><sentence id="112">it's called.</sentence><sentence id="113">This is an old famous Hungarian patriot's name, and he went there and he got his Bachelors Degree there after 8 years.</sentence><sentence id="114">And I went from that...from the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span>, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish leitsiam</span>, which is...the <span class="DLF">street</span> still exists.</sentence><sentence id="115">I don't think that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> existed in <span class="DLF">Albiana Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">Maybe it is.</sentence><sentence id="117">I didn't look for that one.</sentence><sentence id="118">What I was looking for and surprisingly I didn't find when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>...I went for...after 4 years in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I went for a year or so...a year to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">And then from...from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>...the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>, and on the end I ended in the Commercial Academy of Budapest, which is a very beautiful and very important <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">And I went there for 2 years.</sentence><sentence id="121">Actually, I have at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>...in back in <span class="REGION">Arizona</span>, my <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> report cards of 4 years and I found some of the report cards from the Jewish leitsiam, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, so-called <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">I didn't find anything from the <span class="BUILDING">commercial academy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">But as a...as a history, I learned that the <span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span> but as a...as a history I learned at the <span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span> to write <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and geography and mathematics and subjects, accounting and things which was connected to the..uh...<span class="BUILDING">Commercial Academy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">And I didn't find the <span class="BUILDING">Academy</span> at all, and I told my husband that I really have to go back and look for that.</sentence><sentence id="125">Why don't I?</sentence><sentence id="126">So I attended that.</sentence><sentence id="127">So the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years, if I can say that to you...the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="128">The primary years, of course, were the best.</sentence><sentence id="129">I remember all the little gifts we have gotten.</sentence><sentence id="130">I was a very good student in <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> and my late brother, we were always being Jewish students in a...in a Protestant, because Dutch Reform was...mostly, they were Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="131">It's a <span class="BUILDING">reform school</span>, and even we...the Jewish children, we had special <span class="BUILDING">religion class</span> everyday in the morning, the Jewish students...the few of them.</sentence><sentence id="132">And we were allowed to go to their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> where they sing all the beautiful psalms, you know, the Protestant Psalms.</sentence><sentence id="133">And we learned that.</sentence><sentence id="134">And that gave us a very good relationship with the other students.</sentence><sentence id="135">Unfortunately, I have never ever met anybody when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in 77, anybody at all from my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> years.</sentence><sentence id="136">Probably was a Gentile Christian children went other ways.</sentence><sentence id="137">The Jewish probably were all most killed, because I didn't see anybody.</sentence><sentence id="138">So in our life, I speak about, you know, 23, and I got to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was 5 and a half, 20 years, 29, 30, 32, and all the way up to...I would say... remember the date on 1938, that my father was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> sitting at lunch time.</sentence><sentence id="139">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every day for lunch, and he came every evening <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...and the good years he had even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">And I know it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fiat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">And we...we didn't travel on that much I know, but when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Balaton</span> for the summer season for the 4 weeks, we traveled on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">So...but that doesn't mean that we were wealthy, just because he was in this position in this <span class="BUILDING">textile company</span> which was the largest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, he could afford it I suppose or they gave it to him.</sentence><sentence id="143">I don't know whether it was his or the company, but we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">And...uh...I just don't know...that day I remember very clearly...1 remember that for years, that my father opened the newspaper at lunchtime.</sentence><sentence id="145">We were very quiet at lunch.</sentence><sentence id="146">We were not supposed to...not because he was strict.</sentence><sentence id="147">He was not as strict...my mother was stricter to us than my father.</sentence><sentence id="148">I never even been spanked or anything my father ever in my life.</sentence><sentence id="149">Never!</sentence><sentence id="150">I didn't put this in the paper, but I come to my mind, the only time I remember that my father was...became angry with me.</sentence><sentence id="151">One day when I was a child and he said, "You have to go with me today and with , to Grandma," his mother who passed away before the war _____.</sentence><sentence id="152">And I don't know...I didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="153">I said, "No, Father or No, Daddy.</sentence><sentence id="154">I don't go.</sentence><sentence id="155">I don't want to go to the..." And he came to me and shook my shoulder and said, "Yes, you go."</sentence><sentence id="156">And that was the only violent thing from my father toward me.</sentence><sentence id="157">My mother, who I adored and all our lives, my younger brother...I think he was a fantastic son and unusual son too because he cared for my mother in last years of her life.</sentence><sentence id="158">And my mother, if I said something fresh which we were not supposed to...1 remember once that I fought with my older brother.</sentence><sentence id="159">My...my younger brother wasn't alive.</sentence><sentence id="160">We fought or something.</sentence><sentence id="161">And I beat my brother, Yanshi with from anger.</sentence><sentence id="162">And my mother...my brother went to complain to my mother and my mother said, "What did you do?"</sentence><sentence id="163">And I said, "Well, he said something or he didn't want to do something.</sentence><sentence id="164">I beat him.</sentence><sentence id="165">And I said you shouldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="166">You will be punished.</sentence><sentence id="167">And you will be punished now if you continue this."</sentence><sentence id="168">And I was so upset about the punishment, I told my mother, "If you punish me Mother, I commit suicide."</sentence><sentence id="169">A word from a young child.</sentence><sentence id="170">And my mother gave me, "Why did you say that?"</sentence><sentence id="171">And I got it on my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="172">And I cried terribly.</sentence><sentence id="173">And my mother said, "You have to go into the corner, with your back turn around.</sentence><sentence id="174">And I just hysterically cried.</sentence><sentence id="175">Pardon me.</sentence><sentence id="176">And I remember that because ____ I cried, cried and then she came to me and embraced me and said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="177">No, more."</sentence><sentence id="178">And that was the end of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="333">Q: You were saying that your father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: And my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and I remember that he opened the newspaper and he says, "My God, the Germans occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>."</sentence><sentence id="336">And that was in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="337">So, 1938...I was born in 23, so I remember that...at the paper he said that.</sentence><sentence id="338">And that...that from that day on, really times in a way changed.</sentence><sentence id="339">Not much, but in a way, because first of all we lived still in that...in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where I was born, but I don't know if in 1940 or 41, his salary decreased and something happened in the company.</sentence><sentence id="340">He didn't have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> needless to say...anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="341">And in 1941, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>...I remember that very clearly because I was not such a young little girl.</sentence><sentence id="342">I remember in 1941, they began to take away...the Hungarians, the Jewish men.</sentence><sentence id="343">Certain young men, certain age.</sentence><sentence id="344">They had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">1941 or 1942 they began to concentrate these people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">Young men and so I remember that...that time already, we had to move out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">We moved in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called which is forget me <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence

part is very nice, still very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="350">Not too far from our original <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but not that near, maybe a mile and a half or so, walking distance.</sentence><sentence id="351">And we went there because I suppose my father couldn't afford the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">We didn't have a maid then there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="353">Our maid who we loved very much went back to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> on that time.</sentence><sentence id="354">I remember that well.</sentence><sentence id="355">And so we moved to this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which is much smaller.</sentence><sentence id="356">Was very pretty too because I remember that my mother could put her famous curtains and the lace covers.</sentence><sentence id="357">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">I don't know whether they just sold it probably.</sentence><sentence id="359">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, but her own

id="361">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="362">That was with us.</sentence><sentence id="363">So we had a nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there too.</sentence><sentence id="364">And from that <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we were then later on taken to the <span class="BUILDING">David Star house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">I remember that we had to leave that.</sentence><sentence id="366">But the...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> changed because they were frightening times.</sentence><sentence id="367"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> I think entered already in the war as part of the (clearing throat) Nazi Germany.1942 I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="368">I am confused with the dates, which you
