<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: We did --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: We-We'll -- We'll return later to your relationship with your -- your family members, but first, I wanted to ask you some of the things, just to clear up from the 1990 interview that was done at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">Did you have any idea of what year it was, or how old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogrom in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proscurov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">This is where -- My mother felt that she had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we didn't know where m -- our father was.</sentence><sentence id="52">And my brother, of course, we didn't know where he was, since he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="30.523">Kiev</span>, since before the war -- the war started.</sentence><sentence id="53">So, that was after the second pogrom, when my mother felt everybody was killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and she</sentence><sentence id="55"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0030 4 had to run away because they were searching for remaining Jews.</sentence><sentence id="56">So, that's when she left me with that Gentile lady.</sentence><sentence id="57">So, I was six years old, little bit over six, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: And I had a question -- two questions, actually, the first one being, do you know -- do you understand now and did you understand then, why your mother left you alone?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: It's such a interesting question.</sentence><sentence id="71">Did I understand?</sentence><sentence id="72">I -- Obviously, I must have understood something when she said, ""You have to stay here.</sentence><sentence id="73">I must leave with your sister.</sentence><sentence id="74">But," she said, "in the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me, wherever I'm going to be."</sentence><sentence id="75">A-And as much as I didn't like the thought that my mother was leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, "Mama," I says, "but I have a headache."</sentence><sentence id="76">Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay.</sentence><sentence id="77">And she said to me, she said, "The lady will give you an aspirin, and you" ll feel better.</sentence><sentence id="78">And here."</sentence><sentence id="79">She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, "In case you want to buy yourself something and you need money."</sentence><sentence id="80">So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me goodbye, she walked out.</sentence><sentence id="81">Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I must have understood when she said, "I must go, and I can't take you along," she says, "because it is too cold <span class="NPIP">outside</span>."</sentence><sentence id="82">And -- And i-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold.</sentence><sentence id="83">You can really freeze.</sentence><sentence id="84">And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn't even mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet.</sentence><sentence id="85">So, I guess, in the way, I understood that it's cold <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I might get sick or freeze and my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to</sentence><sentence id="87"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0030 5 escape.</sentence><sentence id="88">So, that was my understanding, and I didn't make a scene.</sentence><sentence id="89">I just said, "My head hurts."</sentence><sentence id="90">That's all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: Now, the part two of the question that I wanted to ask that I would -- while I was watching the video, that I wondered -- now, to step way back into the -- well, way up into the future from that moment, did you ever discuss this with your mother, about leaving?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: Interesting.</sentence><sentence id="117">No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Never discussed it and I never, ever felt any resentment.</sentence><sentence id="123">As the years went by, I guess somebody would say, "Oh, Ma, you left me."</sentence><sentence id="124">or "You abandoned me."</sentence><sentence id="125">I never felt that way.</sentence><sentence id="126">And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were reunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first question was, "Mama, why did you leave me?"</sentence><sentence id="127">That I did, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="128">And she just explained to me again what she said, "I had to leave, it was too cold and I was afraid if I take you, you might freeze to death."</sentence><sentence id="129">Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs and a pair of short boots.</sentence><sentence id="130">A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: And your sister was much older than you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: 10 years older.</sentence><sentence id="143">Right, she was already a big girl, so that was different.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: And speaking of the reunion with your mother and your sister.</sentence><sentence id="147">Where -- In the interview -- we are not quite clear from the video interview, what were the conditions, where did you live, did you work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="153"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0030 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: W-We lived in this very, very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was occupied Romania and I understand this was still part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, but it was next to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and they call it occupied Romania.</sentence><sentence id="155">Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and -- a-and <span class="DLF">farms</span> -- <span class="DLF">fields</span>, they had a lot of <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">And this handful of Jewish people lived with the Gentile families, like we did.</sentence><sentence id="157">We lived with this Gentile gentleman.</sentence><sentence id="158">We were two families in one of his <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, because that's all he had is one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">And -- And he slept on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brick oven</span> and we had -- yeah, our life wasn't that simple.</sentence><sentence id="160">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span>, either.</sentence><sentence id="161">If you had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, you had to go out in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">Those days, things were not the way they are today.</sentence><sentence id="163">And so there was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, on -- on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> there was a mother and a daughter whose fingers were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from -- from the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather.</sentence><sentence id="164">They were trying to hide and wherever they hid, they obviously were not dressed properly.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="197">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 7 us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to sleep -- where to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="198">So, we worked on his -- on his <span class="DLF">fields</span> and I was one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the potatoes from -- you know, from under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">And I cleaned them up, put them in a sack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, which I don't know how many blocks it was exactly, I never counted it.</sentence><sentence id="200">To me, it was just part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="201">And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread.</sentence><sentence id="202">So, we didn't have to pay for the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: How often did you get bread?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Oh, they were also working on the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">Well, they must have -- they -- may -- may -</sentence></p><p><sentence id="241">- maybe they did different, you know, diggings, different, whatchamacallit, vegetables,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="242">you know, also it was -- everything was digging up, you know, because like he did the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="243">seeding and then, you know, y -- and you would have to -- in the springtime, that's what</sentence></p><p><sentence id="244">you did.</sentence><sentence id="245">In springtime, everything was growing and you had to rip it off of, or rip it out</sentence></p><p><sentence id="246">of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and bring it into his <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">So we were all just working on the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="250"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0030 8</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: But you were not in hiding at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="253">At that time, it was not a question of hiding, because there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, this was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">You wo -- just would have to be very careful if sometimes a German would pass by in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, you understand?</sentence><sentence id="255">Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know that you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, they have Jews.</sentence><sentence id="256">So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to know that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="257">So, that's how it worked.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Was he -- What would have been his motivation, was -- was it political, was it -- was it a spiritual motivation?</sentence><sentence id="265">Was it circumstantial?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: To say -- Do you mean to hol -- to hide out Jews?</sentence><sentence id="269">Well, there were some good people and he must have been one of those people wh-wh -- who felt sorry for a mother and her children and he also felt, you know, that we'll be devoted and loyal.</sentence><sentence id="270">We'Il -- We'1l work for him, we'll help him out, because after all, he was all alone.</sentence><sentence id="271">And at the same time, he was, you know, saving lives.</sentence><sentence id="272">And that's -- That was really something very, very amazing and very important to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: That sort of reminds me a -- a little bit of what I'm reading about the -- the slaves in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and how there were certain <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, when they were on their way from the south to the north --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="279">A: Took them in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="284"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0030 9</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: -- where they stayed, I wondered, just jumping way into the future, did you have a -- make a connection with the Civil Rights movement at all, or the story of slavery in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: You mean, at the present time, connecting their past and my past?</sentence><sentence id="287">Well, you know, in those years, in my -- my times -- you're talking 55 years ago, there was no such thing as Civil Rights, there wa-was only such a thing as good people versing not such good people.</sentence><sentence id="288">And he was one of those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for -- because of his belief, that God said, you know, you should help others and that's what he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="289">And the mere fact that he took us in, he must have been very special and -- and -- and obviously a believer too, in saving lives.</sentence><sentence id="290">So, you know, things were different then, as they are today, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: Do you have any idea how your mother found him?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: No, but I am sure my mother was something very special.</sentence><sentence id="293">She was someone who was always ahead of everyone.</sentence><sentence id="294">And I imagine she just found out abis -- about this gentleman that, you know, lived alone and she must have approached him and -- and offered, you know, our services and he accepted them.</sentence><sentence id="295">So we are very lucky.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Now, from there I would love to -- whoa.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: That's the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">We're not that far from the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Oh.</sentence><sentence id="307">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaGuardia</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: You see -- no, JFK.</sentence><sentence id="311">You hear that noise?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="319"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0030 10</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Every time -- This is not too bad, but every time, could be in the morning, could be during the day, could be in the evening, suddenly there will be a tr-tremendous noise coming from the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and I think it's from the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, from that direction, and that will bring horrible memories to me and I sometimes just shake and I can't do anything until this noise stops.</sentence><sentence id="321">That reminds me, after the liberation, when we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Proscurov</span>, to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, every night for a whole year, until "45, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span>, 30 or 40 of them would come over every night and bombard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">And so, we would hear that noise, f+ from those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> approaching us and then, of course, either we -- if we had enough time, we would run to <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> and if we didn't, we would just lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and -- and our ho -- our glass, you know the <span class="DLF">windows</span> would be open and we would have tapes on them, that th-the -- the glass should not shatter and we would lie under our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> until they finished bombarding and they left.</sentence><sentence id="323">This is how I lived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Wa -- That's interesting that that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> would give us a cue, cause what -- one thing I - - [know we want to know about, is at the exact time of liberation, because you briefly mentioned it in the video interview and later you say that you never really felt liberated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: And I wondered, for a moment, if we might focus on your experience of the -- the exact moment of liberation are -- are -- and then the few days after that, from a child's -- how old were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: I was, at that time, eight.</sentence><sentence id="335">Eight years old, that was in 1944.</sentence><sentence id="336">And, actually the Russians liberated us, okay, the Russian army.</sentence><sentence id="337">And there was -- it was really horrible, because for</sentence><sentence id="339">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0030 11 a day and night, there was door to <span class="DLF">door</span> fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="340">And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free, that -- I ran into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- to that -- to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, where that lady with her daughter were and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while they were there, I used to go in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and look for a special leaf.</sentence><sentence id="341">There was a special leaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain.</sentence><sentence id="342">Cause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="343">So, we couldn't call for help to help that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those -- that <span class="REGION">area</span> where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn't completely closed.</sentence><sentence id="344">So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>, then they would put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would alleviate their pain.</sentence><sentence id="345">So, I used to do that.</sentence><sentence id="346">But then, when we were told that we are liberated, we are free, we don't have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I ran in to give them the good news.</sentence><sentence id="347">And I was so happy, I was jumping and this poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt.</sentence><sentence id="348">Then, I couldn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="349">She took a broom and she started hitting me.</sentence><sentence id="350">And she said to me, "What is there to rejoice?"</sentence><sentence id="351">Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples.</sentence><sentence id="352">And -- And I was jumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom.</sentence><sentence id="353">And she said, "Well, there's nothing to rejoice about."</sentence><sentence id="354">I says,
