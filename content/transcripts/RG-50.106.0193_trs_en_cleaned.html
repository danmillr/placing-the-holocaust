<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1416">A: The thing is at that time before that Otto was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1417">My father was in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and we, there was supposed to be a plebiscite for the Austrians to vote yes or no, whether we want, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> wanted to be in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">Now I think now when I remember that crowd that I saw that Hitler needed have no worry.</sentence><sentence id="1419">He would have been voted in anyways.</sentence><sentence id="1420">But he didn't wait for that.</sentence><sentence id="1421">But all the Jews, by that time, my father knew.</sentence><sentence id="1422">I mean he had known that he was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1423">But he also knew what the Jews were suffering in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1424">So he then knew, you know he must come, all the Jews who were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, but were Austrian citizens were all making back to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to cast their vote in the hope that they would influence the result.</sentence><sentence id="1425">So my father had rang us by that time.</sentence><sentence id="1426">We had a telephone and said I am just going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but just then about five minutes before, we had just heard Schuschnigg's last speech.</sentence><sentence id="1427">And that was horrifying because he was always, he made a lot of speeches, all <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> must vote and must vote for independence.</sentence><sentence id="1428">That's what he knew.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And he was making another speech and all of a sudden you heard as if things were knocked about and you didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1430">I mean you listen to the radio and you heard knocking.</sentence><sentence id="1431">And then you heard him say, people are just coming in and they are taking me away.</sentence><sentence id="1432">This is the end of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1433">God bless <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and Horst Wesselneed [ph], you know the German which goes today <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, belongs to us.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Tomorrow the whole world.</sentence><sentence id="1435">So we knew the Nazis had, but what had happened was that the Nazi, German troops Hitler had already arranged for the German troops to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, I mean <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> didn't have a (inaudible).So this was the end.</sentence><sentence id="1436">And my father then rang.</sentence><sentence id="1437">And Otto answered the phone.</sentence><sentence id="1438">My father said I am just going to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to catch the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1439">And Otto said well you know it was interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1440">Immediately you felt the Nazis would be listening to what you say.</sentence><sentence id="1441">I mean they weren't that efficient to hacking, phone hacking, right.</sentence><sentence id="1442">Murdoch now has been doing.</sentence><sentence id="1443">But this was sort of mentality.</sentence><sentence id="1444">So then Otto said don't come back and my father said but I must be with you.</sentence><sentence id="1445">Listen to me.</sentence><sentence id="1446">Don't come back.</sentence><sentence id="1447">Finish.</sentence><sentence id="1448">I can't tell you anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1449">Listen to what your radio is saying.</sentence><sentence id="1450">And my father was never in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> after that which was very difficult for Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 29 November 17, 2011 me because to him, I remained his little girl that can't make, little girls don't make decisions.</sentence><sentence id="1451">You know important what you should do, what you shouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1452">But before that after that, when Otto was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, he wrote to me that he had a network of friends also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1453">But they were all social democrats.</sentence><sentence id="1454">It was that that bound them together, not their (inaudible).</sentence><sentence id="1455">And one of them, he actually died in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, last year.</sentence><sentence id="1456">He was a close friend of Otto's.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And he was married already and he had, they were living in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1458">So he wrote to, Otto was trying to get Kurt out but he couldn't get him.</sentence><sentence id="1459">Otto then flirted with one old lady who worked in the <span class="BUILDING">British home office</span> who was in charge of giving visas.</sentence><sentence id="1460">And he had a reason why he flirt, and he ultimately got a visa for Kurt.</sentence><sentence id="1461">But he didn't, couldn't get it quick enough and he too knew that Kurt was really very frightened and it was hard there.</sentence><sentence id="1462">So this friend said, because Austrians didn't need a visa for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> but if you went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> you could cross the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1463">But not if you had a passport with a big red J. The Italians didn't want that.</sentence><sentence id="1464">But ordinary Austrians, not Jewish could just go in.</sentence><sentence id="1465">So he then, this friend from him, who settled in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, wrote to Otto and told him send your brother.</sentence><sentence id="1466">He knew Kurt.</sentence><sentence id="1467">And he actually stayed with them in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1468">They said send him by <span class="DLF">air</span>, because the Italians had not yet realized that you can fly and that you can arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the border people, the border police was trained.</sentence><sentence id="1469">You see a passport with a red J, back, no you know but they flew.</sentence><sentence id="1470">At the <span class="BUILDING">airports</span> they hadn't trained police, trained people who spoke there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1530">A: I got Kurt.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Kurt wouldn't go out.</sentence><sentence id="1532">I, so Otto wrote to me.</sentence><sentence id="1533">You went to the chet [ph] the Italian travel there and then book a flight as early as you can for Kurt to fly to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1534">Once you've got the ticket tell me and he will get, arrange that he will be met on arrival.</sentence><sentence id="1535">And that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="1536">And I was very cross then when I came back.</sentence><sentence id="1537">Kurt then flew to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and second week in May and the Anschluss was in March.</sentence><sentence id="1538">And he was very cross with me that I hadn't got him a flight the day after.</sentence><sentence id="1539">So that's why there was never a very close relationship with him.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1614">Q: But you didn't consider converting in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> for example because <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> also gave certificates.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1616">A: No but not for your grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="1617">No.</sentence><sentence id="1618">You have to think of the total implication and yes

class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1621">Whose parents gave him in to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> through the nuns, say.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And after the war, the parents perished but some relative were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and they then went to find him.</sentence><sentence id="1623">They had to fight because the nuns wanted to keep him.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And this little boy obviously, I have here actually a very interesting thing.</sentence><sentence id="1625">I go swimming to the <span

id="1634">And one person had lit an electric fire and that had caught something and so there had been a fire in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1635">But there was this young woman who somehow, I don't know why it is when I find a fellow Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1636">I somehow feel that they are fellow Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1637">I don't know what it is.</sentence><sentence id="1638">Do you know?</sentence><sentence id="1639">You feel some sort of affinity and there was this young woman, looking very Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1640">Pale but quite hefty.</sentence><sentence id="1641">So I said what do you think and so we began to talk and then they offered us all coffee and we sat having coffee.</sentence><sentence id="1642">And she said where are you from.</sentence><sentence id="1643">So I always say I am a Jewish refugee from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> cause you heard me say it.</sentence><sentence id="1644">And she said you know my father is also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1645">Well her story, she is called Popper, P-O- P-P-E-R and she is a lovely

in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1648">It might have been one of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> that Uncle Willie had taken us.</sentence><sentence id="1649">But certainly were well off.</sentence><sentence id="1650">So they bought immediately as the Anschluss occurred, a holiday ticket I think to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> and off they went, before they introduced a red J on the passports.</sentence><sentence id="1651">When you had money you could go.</sentence><sentence id="1652">So they went there and then they went from <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Kenya</span> his parents put him into a <span class="BUILDING">monastery school</span> and he converted to Catholicism.</sentence><sentence id="1654">And he is, he looks like the stricher [ph] Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1655">He has been, she brought them here.</sentence><sentence id="1656">Her mother is a good England British, I think an Anglican but not a Jew.</sentence><sentence

id="1662">Jewish, who also had children of the age as ours were.</sentence><sentence id="1663">So we every year it was at a different <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1664">But then was my husband conducted the Seder.</sentence><sentence id="1665">My husband had died so Michele said mommy don't because we were usually 30 or 40 people.</sentence><sentence id="1666">So it was quite a lot for me.</sentence><sentence id="1667">She said I (inaudible) it will be just our family and (inaudible) since then she has (inaudible).</sentence><sentence id="1668">So this year too and so I said Michele can I bring this Popper.</sentence><sentence id="1669">I asked her, would you.</sentence><sentence id="1670">She said I'd love to see her so she came and she is now, she wants to convert.</sentence><sentence id="1671">She feels very ill at ease (?)</sentence><sentence id="1672">.So you know there are cases but he feels but here, I had him here when DT Rolner

along.</sentence><sentence id="1674">I said yes, bring them along.</sentence><sentence id="1675">And we'll see how your father feels about meeting an Israeli poet whose mother had been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and who was (inaudible).</sentence><sentence id="1676">And I have never Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 33 November 17, 2011 seen him so ill at

id="1679">Well I feel very sorry for her.</sentence><sentence id="1680">So some, I mean obviously there are some who even became bishops.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1748">Q: Oh yeah of course.</sentence><sentence id="1749">There was even a pope allegedly.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1772">Q: That's good news.</sentence><sentence id="1773">Ok.</sentence><sentence id="1774">Let's go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and how you fled cause we need to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1775">That's the important part of the story.</sentence><sentence id="1776">So you got the visas eventually for <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and then you traveled.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1782">A: Well that was also very interesting you see.</sentence><sentence id="1783">When we arrived there Uncle Willie, we had my mother had from her father had been given some gold pieces for each one of us.</sentence><sentence id="1784">When we were born her father presented.</sentence><sentence id="1785">And that she kept and she didn't want to leave so, I mean I decided.</sentence><sentence id="1786">And she wanted, she thought she would get her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> back and all her <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1787">So I had to find packers and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> we called that a lift.</sentence><sentence id="1788">You

id="1792">And so and actually I gave a lot to our neighbors Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 34 November 17, 2011 in the <span class="BUILDING">Karl Marx building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1793">And then when we, before we made back from the Ring, I wanted a film that will show that people helped her.</sentence><sentence id="1794">So the film director who I told you is a Bronx Jew

expenses.</sentence><sentence id="1796">It costs things to process them.</sentence><sentence id="1797">So we're meeting the (inaudible).</sentence><sentence id="1798">We each put some money in, but not enough.</sentence><sentence id="1799">So he then said well he wanted to sort of build the whole film and he thought we could get the money because I say and this is true the first society that has made me feel I belong.</sentence><sentence id="1800">The first group of people.</sentence><sentence id="1801">Because sociologically you know that none no individual can live as an individual, we all have to belong to a group of people.</sentence><sentence id="1802">Feeling we belong.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> I thought I was a girl, Austrian

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2390">Q: Did anyone speak German?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2392">A: No, no.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2394">Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 43 November 17, 2011</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2395">Q: So how did you communicate, in French?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2396">A: French.</sentence><sentence id="2397">So then one of them who was called Dowana he said well his father had died just before I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durres</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2398">And he had two younger sisters that were in <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2399">But the mother now, since the father has just died, doesn't want to send them back.</sentence><sentence id="2400">Would I be prepared to teach them German, French and mathematics so that they would have some edu.</sentence><sentence id="2401">So I said yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2402">I said well how old are they?</sentence><sentence id="2403">Well I was then 16.</sentence><sentence id="2404">Going on for 17 and they were 14 and 15.</sentence><sentence id="2405">So that I wasn't much older than them.</sentence><sentence id="2406">But I wasn't going to miss out on that.</sentence><sentence id="2407">So he then took me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which was right opposite the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, opposite the <span class="DLF">harbor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2408">It was lovely and they had like the Muslims, the women live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">purdah</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2409">You know there's women, there's a female section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> and the male one.</sentence><sentence id="2410">And so obviously the girls were in the female one.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2411">And I fitted into this.</sentence><sentence id="2412">So I remember I was really very cheeky.</sentence><sentence id="2413">I did, I mean I knew French.</sentence><sentence id="2414">I had done colloquial French, but I wasn't perfect, by any means.</sentence><sentence id="2415">And there are many things that I didn't know the French for.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2416">Well I was teaching it.</sentence><sentence id="2417">Well how do you teach a language to others when you have no language in common.</sentence><sentence id="2418">If you and I know English and I want to teach you Albanian, well I can tell you the English words and learn like I said.</sentence><sentence id="2419">But if, if we don't have a common language it is very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2420">So what I then did was to point this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and I would say the English, the French and the German word, if I knew the French.</sentence><sentence id="2421">The German I would know.</sentence><sentence id="2422">And they would write it down.</sentence><sentence id="2423">And the next day I would say what is this?</sentence><sentence id="2424">And I'd expect them to know.</sentence><sentence id="2425">Well sometimes they asked me for the French word and I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="2426">So you know what I did.</sentence><sentence id="2427">I invented French words.</sentence><sentence id="2428">But I said the words so quickly that they couldn't write them down.</sentence><sentence id="2429">So the next day then I went back and I had a dictionary all right.</sentence><sentence id="2430">I knew the word.</sentence><sentence id="2431">Next day I would say well what is this, French, German.</sentence><sentence id="2432">You know it in German, yes, you know it in French.</sentence><sentence id="2433">Now we have.</sentence><sentence id="2434">Well write it down now properly.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2435">Now I have been trying to find the heirs of this Dowana family.</sentence><sentence id="2436">Because they were wonderful to me.</sentence><sentence id="2437">The women of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, their mothers and aunts and all the relatives that were there, they were all very nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="2438">First of all they always served me with coffee, Turkish coffee and biscuits which was great really for me.</sentence><sentence id="2439">And secondly, from their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a lovely big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> right opposite the <span class="DLF">port</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2440">I sat there with looking out well obviously this is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2441">And</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2442">Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 44 November 17, 2011 I would look out at the <span class="DLF">port</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2443">And I always loved the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, and I told you.</sentence><sentence id="2444">I told my mother I was born at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2445">So and they were all so nice to me and I had a nice environment and I had regularly something to do and they paid me there.</sentence><sentence id="2446">But I was the only refugee that they all saw</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2447">Q: Where did you live?</sentence><sentence id="2448">Was there a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for all the refugees to live or did you stay with families?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2449">A: Well that's where the Joint came in.</sentence><sentence id="2450">These two men that met us, told, first of all they said, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which was the dirtiest and filthiest <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2451">I mean this was for my parents you know we had to say go and have a bottle of eau de cordel [ph] which we had to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2452">I mean it was, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">linens</span> were dirty.</sentence><sentence id="2453">And it was really awful.</sentence><sentence id="2454">But these two men had said you must just stay there for a week because we will look at your credentials.</sentence><sentence id="2455">But if you pass, which we think you will, you can then move, because what they had done, the Joint, there were some <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> around.</sentence><sentence id="2456">And there were also Jewish salesmen from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, selling to these Jewish shop keepers.</sentence><sentence id="2457">And the Joint was sending money.</sentence><sentence id="2458">However many refugees turned up and lived because they had rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2459">And they got, and the shop keeper that got the money from the Joint always had to get a piece of paper from the board of guardians.</sentence><sentence id="2460">These were elderly Polish or Austrian Jews and to send it to the Joint that they would always continue sending.</sentence><sentence id="2461">It was very, very little.</sentence><sentence id="2462">I mean really as a growing girl I was starving.</sentence><sentence id="2463">And I, and there was a larder which was always locked and once they had forgotten to lock it.</sentence><sentence id="2464">And I saw it open and I sneaked in and I got a big piece of bread and I was delighted.</sentence><sentence id="2465">But next day I was hauled before the board of guardians.</sentence><sentence id="2466">That you don't do and my father burst into tears.</sentence><sentence id="2467">You know his little girl.</sentence><sentence id="2468">He couldn't supply enough food that.</sentence><sentence id="2469">I mean it was natural, but I didn't feel terribly guilty.</sentence><sentence id="2470">I was angry.</sentence><sentence id="2471">There was bread.</sentence><sentence id="2472">Why shouldn't I?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2497">Q: So the Joint was paying for this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the refugees were living.</sentence><sentence id="2498">How many people were there in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2501">A: Well when we got there, there were about 35.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2503">Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 45 November 17, 2011</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2504">Q: 35.</sentence><sentence id="2505">Did you manage to either keep in touch with any of those people or to find them after the war?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2506">A: Well now you see after we left, then Otto got visas.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2508">Q: So you left for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2510">A: We left but wait a moment.</sentence><sentence id="2511">He got me one as a hairdresser apprentice and my mother as a domestic.</sentence><sentence id="2512">Well we weren't terribly delighted but better going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was good.</sentence><sentence id="2513">So but not for my father.</sentence><sentence id="2514">So we tried to delay leaving him because he was really suicidal.</sentence><sentence id="2515">He would go along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and was ready to jump in.</sentence><sentence id="2516">And you know it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2517">So we felt that my mother didn't want to leave her husband and | didn't want to leave my father.</sentence><sentence id="2518">But Otto kept extending our visas, but then he sent me a letter and he said listen, unless you arrive before the end of April, 1939, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I cannot extend them.</sentence><sentence id="2519">You will never be able to come here.</sentence><sentence id="2520">So you better come with mother and he said I promise you and mother, you talk with mother and tell her he will do anything just to get a visa.</sentence><sentence id="2521">And he did.</sentence><sentence id="2522">My father came a week before the war started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2536">Q: Wasn't there also a story where you were giving language classes to the Italian counsel or ambassador that become very important later on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2538">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2539">The Italian counsel heard that I was teaching German because these were elite families and I guess there were evening dinners and they must obviously have been together with the local elite.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2542">Q: So there would be what associated with the royal family or the aristocracy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2544">A: Yeah so and he was a very nice guy and he said, they told him you know that I was teaching their daughters.</sentence><sentence id="2545">So he said tell her I want to see her and so they told me and I went.</sentence><sentence id="2546">Ad he then told me that he wanted me to, he wanted to learn German because Mussolini and Hitler were in Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 46 November 17, 2011 <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and it was when they were together, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2547">I mean Mussolini was Hitler's role model.</sentence><sentence id="2548">He really, he wasn't anti-Semitic at first, for a long time but in terms of his -- you know that Mussolini invented the term fascisma [ph].</sentence><sentence id="2549">So you know he was the role model.</sentence><sentence id="2550">So this counsel thought it would help him in his career to know German.</sentence><sentence id="2551">And so I started teaching him.</sentence><sentence id="2552">And I think you must remember this out of my autobiography.</sentence><sentence id="2553">Then we were still there when Mussolini occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2554">And this counsel became the first governor of the <span class="REGION">coastal region</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2555">So the war, the Jewish -- we thought that Mussolini would hand us refugees like a present over to Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="2556">Because it seemed obvious.</sentence><sentence id="2557">We were the only thing that Mussolini got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2558">That Hitler may want.</sentence><sentence id="2559">So we were all terribly -- I mean they were just everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2560">We were sitting in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> when the fighting was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2561">And what was really moving was the next door policemen were worried because they told us.</sentence><sentence id="2562">I mean you could see the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">warships</span> on the horizon.</sentence><sentence id="2563">It was a <span class="DLF">port</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2564">The only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had was the private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yacht</span> of King Zog.</sentence><sentence id="2565">I mean that couldn't defend.</sentence><sentence id="2566">And the policemen told us all they have to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durres</span> against the Italian onslaught is three machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And there, the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of their <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> was flat.</sentence><sentence id="2568">And one of these three machine guns was standing there.</sentence><sentence id="2569">They told us that.</sentence><sentence id="2570">And they said well when the Italians will come ashore we will have to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="2571">That's our job.</sentence><sentence id="2572">And the Italians will want to knock out these three machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="2573">And if they fail, if they miss, then they will kill you.</sentence><sentence id="2574">And we don't want that.</sentence><sentence id="2575">And we thought, we sat together.</sentence><sentence id="2576">And we thought we would, Hitler would throw us out and treated us like nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2577">And here were these little policemen worried about our life.</sentence><sentence id="2578">It was really very moving.</sentence><sentence id="2579">And I tell them that now too so they then said well tonight they told us, the onslaught was coming.</sentence><sentence id="2580">They would come ashore.</sentence><sentence id="2581">So first of all you have to find a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> because not many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2582">Only the richest.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And the richest had gone inland, the Albanian.</sentence><sentence id="2584">But they left their servants to take care of their -- but we you know we went in and we checked that they have a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2585">The servants wanted to stop us or they weren't too strong, strong enough to do that.</sentence><sentence id="2586">So we found a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not too far from where our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="2587">But before this I must tell you, there were Salonika salesmen, Jewish salesmen selling goods.</sentence><sentence id="2588">And well one of them was called Major.</sentence><sentence id="2589">Very nice.</sentence><sentence id="2590">He was 45 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2591">For me he was like he had two feet in the <span class="DLF">grave</span> because you know when you're 16, 17, 45 seems -- but he fell in love with me.</sentence><sentence id="2592">You must think everybody fell into, that was my life.</sentence><sentence id="2593">And so he asked my father for give information so that he could marry me.</sentence><sentence id="2594">At first he had asked me and I said I don't want to Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 47 November 17, 2011 marry anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2595">And then he asked my father and my father said no, she was far too young.</sentence><sentence id="2596">But he, then he also came to see -- but he had money.</sentence><sentence id="2597">So he was always getting me presents and I didn't want them because I thought that make me dependent.</sentence><sentence id="2598">And anyway when it comes then a little story and a little lie.</sentence><sentence id="2599">So we stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> during the onslaught and we heard the shooting.</sentence><sentence id="2600">And they then said we, our guardians had a meeting.</sentence><sentence id="2601">And said let's surrender.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Let's not be sort of taken, but let's surrender.</sentence><sentence id="2603">Let's say we know we are going to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but let's do it with our heads up.</sentence><sentence id="2604">Let's show them that we have courage.</sentence><sentence id="2605">So ok.</sentence><sentence id="2606">So they said well then the shooting stopped and so they said well now we will go and somebody who has, who can speak Italian must lead us.</sentence><sentence id="2607">Well who could do that?</sentence><sentence id="2608">I was the only one.</sentence><sentence id="2609">In teaching German and French I picked up, I'm not fluent but I picked up.</sentence><sentence id="2610">So they gave me a stick and a white handkerchief for army and I should lead.</sentence><sentence id="2611">So I led and I was trying to say in Italian, as best as I could.</sentence><sentence id="2612">We are a group of German and Austrian Jewish refugees and I kept repeating this in my mind as we were walking along.</sentence><sentence id="2613">And we must have been a really crazy lot, looking, you know these old men and women were shuffling along and wearing different kind of clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2614">Anyway, and then came three Italians, one an officer with two guys from around the corner and saw us.</sentence><sentence id="2615">And shouted halt.</sentence><sentence id="2616">So I said stop.</sentence><sentence id="2617">So we stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2618">And then as I had expected, he came up to me and said who are you?</sentence><sentence id="2619">And so and he did.</sentence><sentence id="2620">So I then said in my, in the sentences I had rehearsed.</sentence><sentence id="2621">I said we are a group of German and Austrian -- and he didn't let me go any further.</sentence><sentence id="2622">I didn't get, have to say Jewish refugees.</sentence><sentence id="2623">He put his arm around my shoulder and said Tedeski, German.</sentence><sentence id="2624">Italian, friends, amigo,.</sentence><sentence id="2625"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">amigo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2626">I didn't disillusion him.</sentence><sentence id="2627">And so in a sense that was another saving.</sentence><sentence id="2628">So then he put his two soldiers in charge of walking.</sentence><sentence id="2629">He said where do you live?And I said over there.</sentence><sentence id="2630">I didn't say that was the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2631">And so he walked us back.</sentence><sentence id="2632">But on the way back I thought well if they look through our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and if the police had wanted to hide their guns, then they might have put some into our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and if these Italian soldiers find them then the friendship will be off.</sentence><sentence id="2633">But they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2634">They let us go.</sentence><sentence id="2635">They looked through them but the soldiers said the police hadn't hidden anything.</sentence><sentence id="2636">But then I heard somebody knock at the back, where we had the <span class="DLF">window</span> looking out at the <span class="DLF">wasteland</span> and there was a guy standing in Albanian uniform because they had a very small unit of soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="2637">And he made me understand that he wants clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2638">He wants to get Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 48 November 17, 2011 rid of his uniform.</sentence><sentence id="2639">So I gave him one pajama of my father.</sentence><sentence id="2640">And he stuck, changed there and this was my contribution to the freedom fight of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2641">But then the next day the, who was then the governor, the Italian ex Italian counsel, his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came to our <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> and a uniformed driver, chauffeur had a letter And he had, the guardians went to the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2642">And it was addressed to me.</sentence><sentence id="2643">So they were all excited.</sentence><sentence id="2644">Says now we mean, we are being sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2645">And I opened it and it said now I need you even more and he sent me a letter with so many stamps and he sent every day his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, was picking me up and there are so many guard posts on the way because they had just occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2646">I actually went last July when I made this film because King Zog's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was at the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and of course King Zog had fled.</sentence><sentence id="2647">So this new governor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had moved into King Zog's castle.</sentence><sentence id="2648">So we went, I got in touch with the grandson and I said well they want to film it.</sentence><sentence id="2649">So they allowed us in because there weren't many people.</sentence><sentence id="2650">So this is and then I have to -- and then my Greek boyfriend said, and he knew we had the -- among the young lot who were my sort of I was the pied piper and they followed me was a travel agent.</sentence><sentence id="2651">Because I had gone, since we had the visas for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, I went to the French ambassador and said can I fly because Air France was the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airline</span> that would fly from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, fuel, stop there for refuel and then go on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2652">So that's the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that I thought we were taking.</sentence><sentence id="2653">But they told me I should go to the French ambassador to make sure and do you know they were bastards.</sentence><sentence id="2654">We would have, my mother and I would have just stayed the 20 minutes that it would have taken them to refuel.</sentence><sentence id="2655">But they did not.</sentence><sentence id="2656">And they said we do not want refugees in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2657">At a later date they may have had different stories.</sentence><sentence id="2658">So then among this lot of young men, was one travel agent.</sentence><sentence id="2659">So I asked him.</sentence><sentence id="2660">I said well how can I get from here because I can't go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2661">I have to go you know flying there.</sentence><sentence id="2662">I can't fly.</sentence><sentence id="2663">So how do I get there.</sentence><sentence id="2664">So he then said there is one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> that goes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> to <span

said end of April.</sentence><sentence id="2959">They said well this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is two months delayed.</sentence><sentence id="2960">You know I tell this story always to the

soul.</sentence><sentence id="2964">I mean how was I to know?</sentence><sentence id="2965">And I knew my mother, if I tell her she wouldn't say really that's it.</sentence><sentence id="2966">So I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and had a good cry for myself.</sentence><sentence id="2967">And then I said well then I said I must let me Otto know what the problem is.</sentence><sentence id="2968">Because I realized I mean if we can't get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then he can't do anything but at least he would know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2969">But then I looked up and you know this <span class="BUILDING">Italian travel agency</span>, cit, C-I-T is still was then still working.</sentence><sentence id="2970">And it still, you can still see Cit Italian.</sentence><sentence id="2971">So I looked up and there was Cit, so I said well maybe this is a sign.</sentence><sentence id="2972">So I went in with our passports.</sentence><sentence id="2973">And I said I need a flight to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> from here.</sentence><sentence id="2974">Can it?</sentence><sentence id="2975">And he said no problem.</sentence><sentence id="2976">He said have you got the money to pay.</sentence><sentence id="2977">I mean I was a young one and I got out, had money.</sentence><sentence id="2978"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dollars</span> so, it was safe.</sentence><sentence id="2979">So he said no problem at all and so he rang Air France.</sentence><sentence id="2980">And he said well the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passports</span> I wouldn't be (inaudible).</sentence><sentence id="2981">No.</sentence><sentence id="2982">We won't tell them.</sentence><sentence id="2983">Well he rang other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airlines</span>, but of course the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> needed and couldn't fly such long distances.</sentence><sentence id="2984">Everyone had to refuel on the way.</sentence><sentence id="2985">So we had a tough time.</sentence><sentence id="2986">But the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airline</span> that would take us was <span class="BUILDING">KLM</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2987">But KLM was, we were boarding and we had to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2988">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> we could get onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">KLM flight</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2989">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">KLM flight</span> went, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2990">So I knew so that is when I wrote a letter.</sentence><sentence id="2991">I mean in a sense like Horst Teers mother when she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, writing her last letter.</sentence><sentence id="2992">I wrote a letter to Otto and I said we were ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flight</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">KLM</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2993">We are supposed to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> but if we can't get through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, then you know where we to look.</sentence><sentence id="2994">But that's all I could say and I gave him the time we were due.</sentence><sentence id="2995">But then I said well how do I get it to him.</sentence><sentence id="2996">So I went to talk to the KLM steward and that he is another one who had saved my life.</sentence><sentence id="2997">Because really when you come and see you know taken every step, it was really true.</sentence><sentence id="2998">Somebody turned up that helped.</sentence><sentence id="2999">Because I said you know I said you know we are Jewish refugees.</sentence><sentence id="3000">You can see our passport and I said do we have to get out when we dock at <span class="DLF">German ports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3001">They said yes, the Germans don't allow anybody to remain on Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 52 November 17, 2011 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3002">So first stop was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and I said to mother and as we landed we saw all those swastika flags and all those SS young men and SA brown u -- I mean it was really, you know it brought back all we had seen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3003">We thought we got out.</sentence><sentence id="3004">And my mother was terrified so I said listen.</sentence><sentence id="3005">We'll walk straight and we will show we are not scared.</sentence><sentence id="3006">So we all had to go through <span class="DLF">immigration</span> so when I showed our passport, he said (German) you know what are the requirement, (inaudible) have to do.</sentence><sentence id="3007">So I said no, we're not returning to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3008">I said you can see we have an English visa and that's what our tickets say and that's where we are going.</sentence><sentence id="3009">So he said ok and thankful.</sentence><sentence id="3010">And we sat down but then when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, we all had to get out of there.</sentence><sentence id="3011">And the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> was full of people from passengers from all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="3012">And they announced over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeaker</span> Frau Und [ph] report.</sentence><sentence id="3013">So I then thought well couldn't we disappear in this , how would they find, but then I realized with our passports because everybody had to fill out so then that's when the worst (inaudible) in my life.</sentence><sentence id="3014">Because two Nazi bitches, really you can't use any other term.</sentence><sentence id="3015">They were in the female SA, SS uniforms, black skirts black, jackets, swastika and they took us into a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then said now strip.</sentence><sentence id="3016"><span class="BUILDING">Strip</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3017">I felt you know I couldn't say, but what they were after was what we were smuggling.</sentence><sentence id="3018">They went through every <span class="DLF">seam</span> in our you know skirts and I mean I can't describe and then they were beating us and my mother collapsed and I had to pick her up and they would then say stop helping this cow of a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3019">And I mean it just, I don't want to remember that.</sentence><sentence id="3020">But then fortunately I had this letter.</sentence><sentence id="3021">I had forgotten that I had it in one of the pockets in my jacket.</sentence><sentence id="3022">The letter from this, what used to be the Italian cultural and it was in the government, with all these stamps and the letter said that you know Miss senorina, senorina Trude, it was all in Italian is a friend of the governor of the coastal area of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and should be allowed to pass because that was for their know.</sentence><sentence id="3023">And when they saw this one of them said, what's this.</sentence><sentence id="3024">And I said, I then so again I must say when I think my daughters or my granddaughters wouldn't have but they hadn't been through everything that I had.</sentence><sentence id="3025">I said that's the only thing that we" ll say.</sentence><sentence id="3026">So I said don't you understand Italian.</sentence><sentence id="3027">And they said no.</sentence><sentence id="3028">I said well then you're very stupid and I got a big beating but then she said well what does it say?</sentence><sentence id="3029">So I then said but I read out something which wasn't there at all.</sentence><sentence id="3030">I said and I know the governor.</sentence><sentence id="3031">I know that they are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flight</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and that senorina Trude Grunewald will let me know when she arrives.</sentence><sentence id="3032">And if I don't' hear I will check up on her.</sentence><sentence id="3033">I made that up on the spur of the moment.</sentence><sentence id="3034">And she said you're lying and I said is there nobody.</sentence><sentence id="3035">I said everybody like you who doesn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="3036">Tell him tell me.</sentence><sentence id="3037">Interview with Gertrude Scarlett Epstein 53 November 17, 2011 it should be in Italian.</sentence><sentence id="3038"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> is your friend.</sentence><sentence id="3039">So what are you talking?</sentence><sentence id="3040">I got a lot of bashing, but I don't -- so one of them said to the other, look after these two Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3041">And she went out and she came back and she obviously had found somebody who had read this and understood that it was the Governor of Italian governor of the coastline of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3042">So she said get dressed and so we were bleeding and we were not ina fit state.</sentence><sentence id="3043">And my mother certainly wasn't so when I helped her to dress, they stopped me from helping her and it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="3044">And then we were dressed and they said now you can go back on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3045">So I said our passports because they had them on the (inaudible).</sentence><sentence id="3046">They said you have no right.</sentence><sentence id="3047">You can call yourself very lucky that we let you go so don't ask for anything.</sentence><sentence id="3048">If I were you two.</sentence><sentence id="3049">So we sort of go, went very slowly and trying to get back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and the steward that I had given the letter was standing, of course there were steps up to the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3050">And he was standing at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, sort of waving, being very happy to see us.</sentence><sentence id="3051">But then I sort of shook my head so he came down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and said what's up.</sentence><sentence id="3052">So and I said yes, we can go back to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> but we don't have passports and if we don't have passports I know we will never get in for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3053">So he said leave it to me and he went and he retrieved our -- so you know I felt like kissing him.</sentence><sentence id="3054">But foolishly I never tried to get his name.</sentence><sentence id="3055">To say thank you because if he hadn't got our passports we wouldn't be here now.</sentence><sentence id="3056">So there are so many people who all the way have done a good job and have really been helpful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
