working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were actually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another.</sentence><sentence id="1421">He gave us the instructions; we did them.</sentence><sentence id="1422">He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with us one way or another.</sentence><sentence id="1423">But one day, some more

him around several times, and he grabbed the sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him upstairs, dragged my sack and they came down.</sentence><sentence id="1430">Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even, even, even wrap around the sack.</sentence><sentence id="1431">And that was the end of the incident.</sentence><sentence id="1432">After a while, it organized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> working.</sentence><sentence id="1433">The best units were in the <span

bartering food for clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1436">And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their slaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1437">It was going on a, a <span class="BUILDING">business</span> like a regular <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1439">But the <span class="BUILDING">black marketeers</span>, to them bring in food was not such a big thing.</sentence><sentence id="1440">To them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine.</sentence><sentence id="1441">You know what saccharine is?</sentence><sentence id="1442">Sweeteners.</sentence><sentence id="1443">Or sugar or fat or butter.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And that, at one time or another, it was pretty comfortable to get in, bring it in.</sentence><sentence id="1445">But after a while, it became extremely, extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value.</sentence><sentence id="1446">And in that time, the German Nazis put up a Lithuanian Wachmeister"(r) who was a tall, slim person.</sentence><sentence id="1447">By five o'clock in the afternoon, the <span class="DLF">street</span> to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after a day's work.</sentence><sentence id="1448">That Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the <span class="BUILDING">black marketeers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1449">I had a contract in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work brigade</span>, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of Chaimke Lipman (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1450">He was extremely strong, powerful man.</sentence><sentence id="1451">I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of potatoes was a tool for me to

giving their clothes to the black marketeers to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind.</sentence><sentence id="1457">If you come in even with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all.</sentence><sentence id="1458">He didn't bother you.</sentence><sentence id="1459">If you had the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you.</sentence><sentence id="1460">If you had barley or any other, or any other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no value.</sentence><sentence id="1461">He didn't bother you.</sentence><sentence id="1462">But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and chocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things.</sentence><sentence id="1463">So I had a contract with <span class="BUILDING">Chaimke Lipschitz</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1464">I was buying a big sack of potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I couldn't even move the sack from the, from the, from the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where I bought it.</sentence><sentence id="1466">Chaimke, it was after the <span class="DLF">line</span>-up to go to work, Chaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and after the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, after Jewish walked in there were two <span class="DLF">lines</span> of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg.</sentence><sentence id="1469">Among them was the famous writer, Joseph Garr (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1470">Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out.</sentence><sentence id="1471">Because it was my human duty to give it to them.</sentence><sentence id="1472">And the rest of it was easy to haul with a little more simply, with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1473">And there my neighbors got, and my family got.</sentence><sentence id="1474">I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine.</sentence><sentence id="1475">And there was five hundred saccharine in each box.</sentence><sentence id="1476">That product, brought in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, was deg8 Watchmaster (German).</sentence><sentence id="1477">5 converted to millions, probably, in that time.</sentence><sentence id="1478">You could have gotten twenty-five suits.</sentence><sentence id="1479">You could have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little box.</sentence><sentence id="1480">So I was carried this -- the box was not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin.</sentence><sentence id="1481">So I was carrying under my arm, and dancing like a prima donna with that little box.</sentence><sentence id="1482">Except one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1483">You do realize that if I were caught with that little box getting in the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, I would have been brutally beaten up and shot right there on the <span class="REGION">premises</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1484">And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have
