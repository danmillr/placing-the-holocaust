<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">aunts and uncles and cousins missing from my life.</sentence><sentence id="2">I was very keenly, keenly aware of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6">Q: Did you -- let's -- be-before -- well, let's -- let's follow up on this then, before I ask you again a little bit more about the personas of the -- the persons that your parents were.</sentence><sentence id="7">Ho-How did -- how -- did you -- how did you ask them about it?</sentence><sentence id="8">Did you ask your mother, how come I don't have grandparents?</sentence><sentence id="9">How -- how did this evolve?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: My father came before the war, so his experience was growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from late teenage-hood on, here, as his brothers and sisters, who had been farmed out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="15">And they all had international experiences, some went to <span class="REGION">South America</span>, some went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, some -- I mean, every brother and sister was sent to a different relative around the world.</sentence><sentence id="16">His parents both died before I got to know them, his mother outlived his father, and was alive when I was born, but also died when I was quite young.</sentence><sentence id="17">My mother's side of the family only came through me -- to me verbally, because there were no -- no pictorial histories or scrapbooks, or mementos handed down.</sentence><sentence id="18">So it was only her stories and my imagination that gave them any kind of reality.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: How would she talk about them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="27">Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin , March 15, 2001</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: She talked about holidays that she remembered when she was growing up, what her family life was like.</sentence><sentence id="29">The talents of the various people.</sentence><sentence id="30">The intellectual capabilities, the accomplishments.</sentence><sentence id="31">Her family was very accomplished in many different <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">Sh -- and I think that's why she had great hopes that I would be a pianist like one of her cousins who was world renowned.</sentence><sentence id="33">That didn't do t -- I didn't do too well there.</sentence><sentence id="34">Maybe a dancer.</sentence><sentence id="35">The Russian -- the Russian ballet instructor told my mother, save your money.</sentence><sentence id="36">So th -- so -- so there were -- there were quite a few talents that I did not pick up from her fa -- family side, but reading and education were certainly something that she impressed upon me and I developed my own curiosity in pursuing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="46">Q: Do you remember the circumstance of when you sort of first became aware of your mother's experience during the war, when you realized she was a Holocaust survivor, although at that time you would not have thought about it in those terms, probably.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: No, the dawning was gradual, but the visual indicator was always there.</sentence><sentence id="49">My mother was always physically very different than other mothers.</sentence><sentence id="50">Her physical disabilities worsened as I grew up, and it was because her condition was becoming much more visible and apparent to the outside world that then I came to understand</sentence><sentence id="52">that she had been born perfectly normal, but because of the beatings that she received in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, it was the cause of these physical abnormalities worsening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: How did -- how did you learn about that, though?</sentence><sentence id="60">Did you ask her questions, or did she under certain condi -- circumstances talk about that?</sentence><sentence id="61">Ho-How did you learn about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="65">A: There was never a special day that I remember, that was set aside to say this is what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="66">It was, I think, always part of my consciousness.</sentence><sentence id="67">I think -- I remember one thing, one day I remembered seeing one of my friend's parents who had a number on their arm, and I asked my mother why she didn't have a number on her arm.</sentence><sentence id="68">So I knew that there was a commonality of experience that my friend's parents had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and my mother had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but there was a difference.</sentence><sentence id="69">And I think that started the storytelling a bit more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Did you have -- you just mentioned your friends.</sentence><sentence id="76">Did you have Jewish friends and non-Jewish friends, or pretty much Jewish friends and were there si -- children of -- of survivors, other children of survivors among them too?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: The <span class="REGION">area</span> that I grew up in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> was a terrific mix of Jewish, Italian, Irish and in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, black.</sentence><sentence id="80">But for th -- my earliest <span class="BUILDING">school</span> experiences, I would say 95 percent of my classmates -- at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> used to place you in a class of your ability, so the classes were numbered one, two, three, four, so if you were in</sentence><sentence id="82">the first grade in the first class, that means that you were the most academically superior.</sentence><sentence id="83">So always being in that first class, it seemed that the make-up was 95 percent Jewish at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Did you talk -- did you have close friends, like really very close friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: I still have them to this day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: Oh, you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: Did -- did you talk to them -- were they children of Holocaust survivors too, by any chance?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: The three friends that I have from when I was 10 years old were all American born and their parents were American born, so no, they -- they didn't experience the particular childhood that I did.</sentence><sentence id="101">But I had other friends in the second circle of my -- of my associates that had Holocaust survivor parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: And did you talk to your friends about it, and to your best friends about -- about that in some way, did you feel that you wanted to?</sentence><sentence id="105">Did they ask?</sentence><sentence id="106">They probably got -- came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: Sometimes I remember there were discussions at -- at -- at lunch about parents having nightmares and we would only discuss it amongst ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="108">My mother wasn't one of those, but -- but I had a friend, Mary Chewbowski who used to tell</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="115">me about her mother's nightmares, and we were very protective of each other.</sentence><sentence id="116">It was almost a different circle of friends, the immigrant kids, then the other Jewish kids who really didn't have any way of relating to what it was like to have to be a nurturing support to your elder parent.</sentence><sentence id="117">It was -- it was a role reversal even at a younger age that some of my friends had.</sentence><sentence id="118">My mother at that point was stronger than some of my friend's parents, who were much more emotionally crippled at that stage, at that stage.</sentence><sentence id="119">My mother was stronger, but the years have taken their toll.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Let's stay in the earlier years a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="126">What do you remember from your family life?</sentence><sentence id="127">What di -- what did you do?</sentence><sentence id="128">What was the relationship between you and your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: I was an only child.</sentence><sentence id="134">I was told very early on that my mother had lost all her family, and when the doctors told her that she was not supposed to have a child, that her response was that she didn't survive the war not to have a child.</sentence><sentence id="135">So no matter what the physical cost was going to be -- which put a little guilt on me because I knew that she was taking a risk and did damage her condition further by bearing me, but that she felt that she lived for a purpose and the purpose was to have a family, and that was me, but there was only just me.</sentence><sentence id="136">So I didn't have any brothers and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="137">I didn't have any grandparents or cousins, or people from her side that she could relate to.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: When you look back, what kind of a child do you think you were?</sentence><sentence id="143">How do you see yourself as a -- as a -- as a younger child?</sentence><sentence id="144">I don't want to lead you, just how did you see yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: My mother will probably say that I was spoiled, and I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="146">My -- I was -- I was -- I will admit that my parents were extraordinarily generous of their time and the amount of input that they put into my cultural awareness.</sentence><sentence id="147">I grew up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I tell everybody that I did.</sentence><sentence id="148">I -- I spent more time going to <span class="DLF">botanical gardens</span> and <span class="BUILDING">zoos</span> and Radio City Music Hall, and shows when I was young.</sentence><sentence id="149">And I turned around and did the same thing for my daughter because my -- my life -- my childhood was so full of extraordinary outings, that I couldn't wait to turn around and do that when I had a child, so I -- my -- my social activities with my parents were extraordinary.</sentence><sentence id="150">Maybe that was to make up for lack of family affairs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: I take it from your -- from what you just said, that you did not experience that necessarily as -- as a pressure, but more as an opportunity, or was it also sometimes a -- a -- a pressure behind this to -- to -- having to fulfill certain expectations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: No, I wasn't -- I wasn't exposed to these things necessarily to have them drummed into my psyche that this is what you must know in order to be a cultured person.</sentence><sentence id="160">Everything was on an equal basis.</sentence><sentence id="161">Going to the <span class="BUILDING">movies</span>, or seeing the</sentence><sentence id="163">Rockettes was on the same level as going to a <span class="BUILDING">ballet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">So everything was done with a sense of -- of fun and a special occasion, and dressing up and going downtown to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">So it was -- it -- it was never an expectation that I would be able to then recite to impress anybody what I had been exposed to.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was just something that would cu -- just culturally open me up to the rest of the world, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: When you went to the -- to the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of your friends, did you perceive differences?</sentence><sentence id="177">Was your upbringing a different one?</sentence><sentence id="178">And if so in what -- in what way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Lalways believed my parents to be much more strict than my mu -- than my friend's parents who were American born.</sentence><sentence id="183">And we're talking about my Jewish friends.</sentence><sentence id="184">Some of their parent were the -- brought up in the 40's here, very liberal, virtually leaning on the Communist way, so that they were allowed to stay out late and make decisions for themselves when my parents said, we have to know where you are and who you're with and what time you're going to come back, and so I felt that there was much stronger bungee cords on my freedom than my par -- than my - - my peers experienced.</sentence><sentence id="185">Now that I'm a parent, I don't know whether it wasn't a good idea, cause I probably mimicked more than I -- than I want to admit.</sentence><sentence id="186">But no, my parents were more strict than my friends.</sentence><sentence id="187">And ma -- and my friends used to</sentence><sentence id="189">push me and my parents would explain to my friends why they did what they did.</sentence><sentence id="190">And ma -- and my friends respected and still respect my parents for doing that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Are your parents very different from each other?</sentence><sentence id="202">Are they -- how -- do you see them very differently?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Describe the --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Entirely differently.</sentence><sentence id="210">My mother is the intellectual.</sentence><sentence id="211">My father is the very easygoing sense of humor.</sentence><sentence id="212">My mother is very nervous and ferociously protective.</sentence><sentence id="213">My father was strict, but yet, not as verbal about it as my mother was.</sentence><sentence id="214">But I didn't want to cross any <span class="DLF">lines</span> with my father.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: Let's talk about your education a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="222">You -- what kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go to in the beginning?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: I went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>, New York public schools were wonderful at that time, and then to, as I said, keep broadening my field of reference, my parents would, on a very meager income, sacrifice and send me to <span class="BUILDING">Swiss schools</span> for the summertime.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="226">I always say that there was a <span class="BUILDING">finishing school</span> and th-they finished me off but good.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="227">I'm very polished, highly polished, to a g -- a great gloss.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: I detect the irony, of course, but -- but si -- say -- say a little bit more about that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="233">Was it -- I mean, it was obviously a very different cultural experience [indecipherable] Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yes, I mean they sent me to -- they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sleep away camps</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and -- when I was younger.</sentence><sentence id="235">Some of them were Jewish, some of them were not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="236">My memories of them are that I -- I know that they sent me away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so I didn't have to bear the city heat.</sentence><sentence id="237">My -- before I was sent away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we always went away -- my mother and I went to the Catskills, and my father would come up weekends, just like the other fathers would come up and visit, so that my summers were very pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="238">But then when I became of an age where there -- they wanted to also have some kind of growing experience, or benefit to be derived from a summer away, that's when they looked into these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> for me, and I went to the same one for two summers in a row.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Did that subject matter ever come up, being in Europe?</sentence><sentence id="249">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was neutral at the time, but sort of the Holocaust, did that ever come up?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: Do you think it was difficult for your mother to let you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="270">A: Pm -- I'm sure -- I'm sure fo -- for any mother of a single child, it's difficult to let a child go, but you g -- you get tremendous satisfaction from seeing your child come back glowing with the experience.</sentence><sentence id="271">If they've had an unhappy experience, of course you carry that guilt with you also.</sentence><sentence id="272">But what could be terrible about spending the summer in Europe?</sentence><sentence id="273">So I had -- I had fabulous times, and it -- it certainly made a seed germinate that I wanted to study in Europe later on, which I did in <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Let's stick with being a teenager a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="279">You sort of came of age in a kind of an interesting time.</sentence><sentence id="280">I mean, the 60's were rolling around.</sentence><sentence id="281">What -- what had impact?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="282">I mean, there was so much happening at that time, what -- what -- what had an impact on you?</sentence><sentence id="283">What kind of music did you like?</sentence><sentence id="284">How were you as a teenager?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: I was a very -- I was a very typical teenager.</sentence><sentence id="286">I was as crazy about the Beatles as everybody else in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">Some of my American second generation friends were experimenting with drugs, and this is where the strictness factor came in with my parents, they -- they practically used to sniff out the backpacks of my friends when they came in, were very, very protective about what was coming into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and -- and what was be -- what activities were being engaged outside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">So I was not as brave, or as adventurous as some of my American friends because I didn't want to upset my parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: In terms of social movements, was there anything that kind of had an impact on you, that sort of was important to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: What did you do for them, or with them?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: I know of course that things don't always work on that kind of simplistic, linear, logical order, but do you think that the experience of your -- that your awareness of your mother's past and of the Holocaust and so on, and second World War had kind of sensitized you in a different way, or is that no -- is -- is that not -- set apart from it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: The -- the Vietnam war was affecting my friends, and I didn't see it as a corollary to World War II.</sentence><sentence id="331">I mean, yes, if you want to take war is a bad thing in</sentence><sentence id="333">Interview with Shelly Rothschild-Sherwin 6 March 15, 2001 general, but that was really so subliminal.</sentence><sentence id="334">It was -- it was affecting my friends, my friends were having to go through the draft.</sentence><sentence id="335">So it was a close, personal fear.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Okay, let's talk about your education a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="343">So what did you study, and when -- we have to -- I -- I want to get a few figures in there, so that we don't get totally lost in -- in -- in where we are.</sentence><sentence id="344">You -- you went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="563">A: We talk about it sometimes, and I -- I think -- I think I'm -- my mother really tries to be forgiving, it's -- it's getting harder, because when we talk about it when there is a rise in neo-Nazism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> now, what has the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> learned?</sentence><sentence id="564">Why should we be -- be more fo -- mo -- why should we be more forgiving when the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is opening itself up to this type of hatred again?</sentence><sentence id="565">It's -- it's too threatening to be able to say that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has learned its lesson and it'll never happen again.</sentence><sentence id="566">It could.</sentence><sentence id="567">I'm not saying -- I'm not saying a Jewish Holocaust will happen again, but that kind of -- of rise of that party is very disturbing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
