<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="12">A: My father was born in 1889.</sentence><sentence id="13">He was drafted into the old Czarist Russian army in World War I. He was wounded at the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tannenberg</span>, the only battle the Russians really fought in World War I and was a prisoner of war in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria-Hungary</span> for four years.</sentence><sentence id="14">It runs in the family.</sentence><sentence id="15">He came back in 1919, married his childhood sweetheart.</sentence><sentence id="16">They had very promptly two children, a girl and a boy.</sentence><sentence id="17">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liepaja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">Then they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ventspils</span> and now they had in this <span class="BUILDING">musical home</span> a future pianist and a future violinist so I had to come along and play the <span class="INT_SPACE">cello</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">We were at the cross-culture in that western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, which was heavily influenced by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="20">We spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and Russian, and Latvian and when they wanted to speak so that we wouldn't understand it, they also spoke English.</sentence><sentence id="21">Like I say, it was a very musical <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and then everything -- well, he had some standing timber and a <span class="BUILDING">sawmill</span>, and a <span class="DLF">dock</span> for exporting lumber, and he bought all of that on credit after World War I and lost the whole kit and caboodle in the depression.</sentence><sentence id="22">So, then he sold everything except our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> during the depression where he sold insurance door to <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">My mother went to work as a bookkeeper and we three kids took care of each other.</sentence><sentence id="24">I was five years old at the time.</sentence><sentence id="25">My sister was five years older, and a brother in between.</sentence><sentence id="26">So, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">I did my first two years in a German</sentence><sentence id="29"><span class="BUILDING">language school</span> because our last governess was German and we spoke predominantly German.</sentence><sentence id="30">Before that it was Russian, so I was raised in the classics of both languages.</sentence><sentence id="31"><span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> didn't have classics yet.</sentence><sentence id="32">So, I wore all the hand-me-downs from my sister and brother.</sentence><sentence id="33">It was a fairly routine life.</sentence><sentence id="34">That was 1930 from there until 1934 <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> went through a benign revolution, so- called, and a fellow by the name of Karlis Ulmanis took over as President.</sentence><sentence id="35">He had his own secret police, which was heavily oriented to the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="36">There were no anti- Jewish campaigns and | lived there in that fashion until it came time to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">My sister was a secretary to earn some money but she also was predominantly a ballet dancer and did that from age six until the end.</sentence><sentence id="38">She died at 20.</sentence><sentence id="39">My brother was totally geared to music and finally under the Soviets enrolled in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and studied economics, which is quite alien to his nature.</sentence><sentence id="40">That was a rather peaceful co existence until 1940, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="41">1940 the Soviets came and converted <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> into a Soviet republic.</sentence><sentence id="42">In 1941 the war broke out for us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Before you go any further, now these <span class="BUILDING">German language schools</span> you went to I assume they were <span class="BUILDING">public high schools</span> and they were mixed with Gentiles?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Any incidents or was that pretty comfortable?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: No, before 1938 it was pretty comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="83">After "38 or just before "38 Hitler called all the ethnic Germans back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the so called Volksdeutsche, people whose families had</sentence><sentence id="85">lived there for centuries suddenly discovered that they were German instead of Latvian.</sentence><sentence id="86">Some kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started to wear the Hitler Youth uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="87">So, there were frequent fist fights after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">Never in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it wasn't done.</sentence><sentence id="89">The pasttime was "Well, let's go out after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and beat the Germans," and they had similar past times.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: So you were involved in all of this as a boy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: Yes, but not very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="104">Q: It didn't make you concerned, or it did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: There was no prediction of the future, no.</sentence><sentence id="107">On the contrary because we were raised in the German classics, and people who could produce Beethoven's 9th with Schiller's words couldn't possibly do what was being done.</sentence><sentence id="108">And really until the Kristallnacht of "38 there was no such official program.</sentence><sentence id="109">So, no there was no premonition.</sentence><sentence id="110">There was some premonition when in 1940 a business friend of my father's, a German from <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span>, came to visit us and said, "You must get out of here."</sentence><sentence id="111">We had, at the end of the Polish war, we had a joint parade with the Soviets, and we marched in formation and you know with the goose-step and all that, to impress the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="112">Then there was nothing for a while, and then we heard this distant thunder.</sentence><sentence id="113">Then there was this incredible cavalcade of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">T-34 tanks</span> and it scared us.</sentence><sentence id="114">You must get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="115">There will be a war.</sentence><sentence id="116">Well, we didn't believe that.</sentence><sentence id="117">So, no there was not really a premonition.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: Did you come from a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: My mother came from a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">My father was a self- professed atheist who thought that his children should attend <span class="BUILDING">religious institutions</span>, <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">Pick one that is comfortable and stick with it.</sentence><sentence id="141">I'm still looking.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: How was life under the Russians?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: For us it was an improvement because my father didn't have to -- he wasn't on his own anymore.</sentence><sentence id="149">He became a bookkeeper for two nationalized industries as a full time job.</sentence><sentence id="150">He was on salary, and our financial situation improved.</sentence><sentence id="151">My mother didn't have to work anymore.</sentence><sentence id="152">My brother's <span class="BUILDING">college</span> was paid for, so in that respect at that time, life improved.</sentence><sentence id="153">It didn't stay that way, but it improved.</sentence><sentence id="154">It changed just before the outbreak of hostilities between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.</sentence><sentence id="155">The Soviets were very confused apparently.</sentence><sentence id="156">Stalin did not believe that there was going to be a war, that his friend Adolf was going to attack him, and apparently made no preparations for such a war.</sentence><sentence id="157">There was on the other hand there was a movement in the Soviet Union to move unreliable elements out of the <span class="REGION">areas</span> where there might be a conflict.</sentence><sentence id="158">That included certainly <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">So, on the night of June 13, 1941, the word got out that they are rounding up people, and it was a memorable night.</sentence><sentence id="160">It was my mother's 50th birthday.</sentence><sentence id="161">They simply had a list prepared by the NK VD, by the secret police, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army trucks</span> came around and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and you went with your little satchel via <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and from there to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gulags</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">We anticipated being taken because we were classified as former bourgoise, therefore untrustworthy.</sentence><sentence id="163">They didn't come.</sentence><sentence id="164">And it was few weeks later on I met a young man in the NK VD who told me that he had taken our paper and put it to the bottom of the pile because he was a college friend of my</sentence><sentence id="166">brother's.</sentence><sentence id="167">So, that was his favor to us.</sentence><sentence id="168">About that time, my brother was drafted into the Soviet Army.</sentence><sentence id="169">He was a musician.</sentence><sentence id="170">He didn't know which end of a gun the bullet came from.</sentence><sentence id="171">Youngsters were shipped off to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> in the coming battles, but since they didn't trust the non-Soviet peoples, the Latvians, with a weapon, he wasn't given a weapon.</sentence><sentence id="172">So, when the Germans did come, they weren't even able to shoot back.</sentence><sentence id="173">So, my brother was killed near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">The exact date and <span class="NPIP">place</span> are unknown.</sentence><sentence id="175">That was the beginning -- that was just before the war for us.</sentence><sentence id="176">I'll spend a little bit of time on life before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbarossa</span>, before that war, to set the stage, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="177">What did we do, how did we live?</sentence><sentence id="178">We had a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span>, five <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">We had managed to retain from Ventspils a concert grand, a <span class="DLF">Steinway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">My mother used to play in a rather unique orchestra.</sentence><sentence id="181">Eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> played four handed so there was a full sound utilizing what Liszt had done to arrange all the Beethoven's symphonies, for example, for that kind of orchestra.</sentence><sentence id="182">One of her distant relatives, Maria Solmonovich, was a concert pianist since age 6 and a student of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glazunov</span>, who did her pre-concert exercises, if you will, on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> because it was larger than hers.</sentence><sentence id="183">We would sit in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, quiet as church mice listening to that.</sentence><sentence id="184">It was uninterrupted pleasure really, except for the concert she gave with Professor Metz, the head of the violin section of the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span>, and a young cellist named Aronson.</sentence><sentence id="185">They played the Tchaikovsky trio which was dedicated to the death of a dear friend.</sentence><sentence id="186">Maria died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soviet Gulag</span>, Professor Metz in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and Lev Aronson I found quite by accident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> where he was the principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony and a teacher at the <span class="BUILDING">Southwestern University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">This musical tendency just permeated a lot of our life.</sentence><sentence id="188">Like I said, my sister was a ballet dancer and she with four other girls toured the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> giving ballet performances.</sentence><sentence id="189">So the language was culture.</sentence><sentence id="190">The interruption of that culture became doubly painful.</sentence><sentence id="191">That was the background.</sentence><sentence id="192">My personal tendency, I played the <span class="INT_SPACE">cello</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">My personal tendency was towards engineering and I became the outstanding physics student in my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and</sentence><sentence id="195">that love for physics stayed with me afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="196">My best friend was Alexander Bergmans.</sentence><sentence id="197">Sasha, as he was called.</sentence><sentence id="198">Sasha and I used to hang out together every evening when I wasn't busy with my girlfriend Helga, who was totally adorable, and whom I was going to marry.</sentence><sentence id="199">It was generally assumed in the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at some later time.</sentence><sentence id="200">That kind of existence, rather almost pastoral until things collapsed.</sentence><sentence id="201">Our first indication of things to come was when my father didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work one day.</sentence><sentence id="202">We found out that by bribing people that he had been arrested by the Latvian secret police and was held in one of their <span class="BUILDING">jails</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">On the denunciation by the Gestapo in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that he was a British spy.</sentence><sentence id="204">This was very interesting later on.</sentence><sentence id="205">It came about because he had a former business competitor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who wanted to get rid of him.</sentence><sentence id="206">In German the in between man between the seller and the buyer is an agent, ein Agent.</sentence><sentence id="207">That has a double meaning, and he was quick to utilize it.</sentence><sentence id="208">So, we got him out.</sentence><sentence id="209">We bribed the police.</sentence><sentence id="210">We got him out, but that stayed in our memory.</sentence><sentence id="211">So, we had to be very careful.</sentence><sentence id="212">We had to check on each other.</sentence><sentence id="213">Except for that one incident, things were "normal."</sentence><sentence id="214">Then came the war.</sentence><sentence id="215">There was very little buildup for Barbarossa, for the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="216">At least not noticeable.</sentence><sentence id="217">There were signs that the governments involved just ignored.</sentence><sentence id="218">The German attack started on June 21, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="219">Within days the German army had slashed through the rather meager Soviet defenses, and kept going.</sentence><sentence id="220">On the way they went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, and with them came the first anti-Jewish regulations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Now, where were you at this time, what was happening?</sentence><sentence id="298">What was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Well, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">It was exciting to witness what was going on, just as it was exciting before to listen to radio Warsaw during the German attack when they played over and over</sentence><sentence id="304">again a piece by Chopin: the same piece, until suddenly they went off the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">Then we knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was no more.</sentence><sentence id="306">It was a strange excitement certainly, witnessing history.</sentence><sentence id="307">We had, ourselves, no premonition of what was to come afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="308">I was in the <span class="DLF">street</span> witnessing it, watching the German army come in.</sentence><sentence id="309"><span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> had a very strong pro-Nazi underground, or movement if you will called Perkonkrusts".</sentence><sentence id="310">These people were out in force, of course, waving the swastika and greeting their brothers in blood.</sentence><sentence id="311">It was a chilling experience but interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Frightening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: Not frightening, but scary, a slight difference.</sentence><sentence id="328">But again, had we known what was going to happen, we would have been doing other things.</sentence><sentence id="329">Under the Soviets we had to declare a <span class="INT_SPACE">spare bedroom</span> and we received somebody that the Soviet government decided should stay in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">He was the director of the <span class="BUILDING">Latvian bank</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">When his family arrived, he brought two Russian girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, the head bookkeeper and the head cashier.</sentence><sentence id="332">They were adorable youngsters, 20, 21 years old.</sentence><sentence id="333">When things fell apart, when the war began, they urged us to come with them, that they would make room for us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">And we said, no, it's going to pass.</sentence><sentence id="335">So, we didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="336">Again, in retrospect, it was very foolish, but it was not a normal situation.</sentence><sentence id="337">So when the Wehrmacht--the German army--came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, they were promptly followed by civilian administrators from the party and they instituted anti-Jewish regulations.</sentence><sentence id="338">You had to wear a star that identified you.</sentence><sentence id="339">Your passport was stamped.</sentence><sentence id="340">You couldn't get ration cards, so you had to finagle your food using up all resources.</sentence><sentence id="341">You couldn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">You had to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, like the horses.</sentence><sentence id="343">They were basically things designed to set you off from the rest of the population and to reduce your self image, "Latvian: Thunder Cross.</sentence><sentence id="344">Latvian pro-fascist party.</sentence><sentence id="347">and I think that everything the Nazis ever planned to do was centered on reducing your physical resistance and imposing regulations that would detract from you as a person.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: Was it effective?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Oh, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="374">I think so.</sentence><sentence id="375">I developed a stutter which I ascribed to that, and it took me quite a while to get rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="376">Yes, I think it was effective, at least it was in me.</sentence><sentence id="377">Not enough to remove me from society.</sentence><sentence id="378">A German officer of the German Marine Corps was then billeted in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span>, and we quickly became acquainted.</sentence><sentence id="379">He had an orderly who was a cute youngster who had been working on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ocean liners</span> all his life, and we became close friends.</sentence><sentence id="380">That gentleman wanted our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">He got our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and he got a signed receipt that it was given to him.</sentence><sentence id="382">I don't know how grateful he was, but he did suggest that my father and I both go to work in his organization in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">He was in charge of a German Marine Corps food supply warehouse.</sentence><sentence id="384">A big nine story affair with chilled <span class="INT_SPACE">cooling rooms</span> and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="385">So, we became longshoremen.</sentence><sentence id="386">My dad and I would walk off to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> every day and work until they closed up and then walk <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="387">It was hard work.</sentence><sentence id="388">They quickly liked my father because of course we spoke fluent German and he was so darn intelligent that he could guess what they needed and tell them what they needed.</sentence><sentence id="389">I was the guy who dragged the heavy boxes and bags.</sentence><sentence id="390">I had two teachers, professional longshoremen who said they were going to make a laborer out of me or kill me in the process, and they did a very good job.</sentence><sentence id="391">I developed physically very well.</sentence><sentence id="392">I ate like a horse.</sentence><sentence id="393">My breakfast in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was nine eggs, raw, with a half of cup of sugar and a cup of rum.</sentence><sentence id="394">That was my breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="395">It went down <span class="DLF">hill</span> from there.</sentence><sentence id="396">Low cholesterol.</sentence><sentence id="397">It was an existence, abnormal as it was.</sentence><sentence id="398">Then came an order that all Jews</sentence><sentence id="400">had to move, leave their belongings and leave their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and move to this one part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow suburb</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">That was in September.</sentence><sentence id="402">Once we were all there, they put a <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> around it and then guards, and it now became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: Let me just interrupt you a moment before we get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">In this period after the Germans had entered in June and until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> you were still out in the world a bit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="441">Q: Your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had stopped?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: What about the people that you knew from before the war.</sentence><sentence id="446">What was the local reaction to what was going on?</sentence><sentence id="447">Were Jews safe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="451">A: Relatively speaking, yes.</sentence><sentence id="452">There were incidents early on.</sentence><sentence id="453">There was the famous Gogol Street synagogue incident where Jews were rounded up on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> and locked up in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and then put to fire.</sentence><sentence id="454">They all died.</sentence><sentence id="455">The ruins of that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> are preserved as a monument to the occasion, but another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> was recently, in June of 1995, was bombed so that the anti-semitic tendencies of the Latvian population are still fairly strong.</sentence></p></dialogue>
