<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="742">A: So he was -- he was offered to build a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Puerto Rico</span>.</sentence><sentence id="743">So since that uncle, who was a dentist representative of <span class="COUNTRY">Ecuador</span>, he told him, well, if you just came from <span class="COUNTRY">Ecuador</span>, you speak Spanish, you want to manage my <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> [indecipherable] from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">So they settled to <span class="COUNTRY">Puerto Rico</span> for some time.</sentence><sentence id="745">So Georgine, not having any other family, from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Puerto Rico</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
