<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Tell me your full name and then tell me when and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Iam Rudolf Haas and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1912.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Tell me a little bit about your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and your family life dating back to the earliest memories that you have - even before World War I.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: On that I can't quite remember, but when I recall my earliest years, that was approximately 1917, 1918, during the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="10">We lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> which was the most common arrangement those days, and probably still is.</sentence><sentence id="11">My father had a small business of his own selling paper material and printing to the various <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">It was a middle class family, quite reasonably comfortable, without the luxuries of this day.</sentence><sentence id="13">You had a cold water flat actually.</sentence><sentence id="14">You only had hot water once a week when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen stove</span> was on because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen stove</span> heated the water as it were.</sentence><sentence id="15">And so once a week you had hot water.</sentence><sentence id="16">That's when you took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> in those days.</sentence><sentence id="17">Otherwise, you had these old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> - you know, these coal fired <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">And during the 17-18's, during the war, coal supplies became very short and I still remember when we had to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pushcart</span> and go to the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where the coal was brought in.</sentence><sentence id="19">And you had to try to get the supply of coal to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so you could be warm during the winter years - 1917-1918.</sentence><sentence id="20">And I also remember those days when you had to get up in the middle of the night and go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> as a bomb shelter because the French primarily bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in those days, and I remember the tracer bullets at night.</sentence><sentence id="21">I can still see that, believe it or not.</sentence><sentence id="22">And I remember the shaking of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> when the bomb landed nearby, and one actually did get this close - I would say it was a hundred yards from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">There was a <span class="DLF">zoological garden</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and that's where the bomb landed.</sentence><sentence id="24">And I remember the impact of that.</sentence><sentence id="25">And I remember seeing the <span class="DLF">bomb crater</span> the next day when we looked at the damage that was done.</sentence><sentence id="26">And, so I still have quite vivid memories of the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="27">And I also remember the great day in 1918 when the War ended, and for the first time then we were able to have rolls for breakfast again.</sentence><sentence id="28">And that was something I had never experienced before because that was a special treat.</sentence><sentence id="29">During the war that wasn't available.</sentence><sentence id="30">That's about primarily what I remember of the War years.</sentence><sentence id="31">I did enter the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1918.</sentence><sentence id="32">I started <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> in 1918 and, <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> let's say.</sentence><sentence id="33">And I remember one of the first things we had to do was practice going to the <span class="DLF">bomb shelter</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">That was then in the spring of 1918.</sentence><sentence id="35">That's when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started - in April usually.</sentence><sentence id="36">So that still sticks in my memory quite vividly... My first <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year was practicing to go to the <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Tell me in general about... Tell me a little more about your family.</sentence><sentence id="66">Introduce me to your family that was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> - your grandparents...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="69">A: Well, I, actually I only knew very little of my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="70">Our own family was my father, mother and two sisters who were quite a bit older.</sentence><sentence id="71">One sister was ten years older; the other sister was eight years older.</sentence><sentence id="72">And so | actually had very little contact with them until later years.</sentence><sentence id="73">But we had a grandmother living with us who was quite ill, and I remember she was bedridden.</sentence><sentence id="74">And for a short period of time that I recall, she was taken care of at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and died probably in the early 20's.</sentence><sentence id="75">That was my father's mother.</sentence><sentence id="76">My mother's mother had died a long time ago as had my father's father.</sentence><sentence id="77">So the only one I really knew was my mother's father who was born in 1850, lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">He was a cattle dealer like so many people in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and he was active until 1930 when he passed away at the age of 80, which was quite a remarkable age in those days.</sentence><sentence id="79">That was the place where we use to spend our summers.</sentence><sentence id="80">There was no such thing as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> for children or anything.</sentence><sentence id="81">We had a vacation in the summer.</sentence><sentence id="82">is short only six weeks usually and that was spent in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with some relatives.</sentence><sentence id="83">So what I especially treasured was a vacation with my grandfather who had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, and I was able to hold the reins for the horse.</sentence><sentence id="84">That was the biggest treat that I could think of.</sentence><sentence id="85">So, several summers I spent with my grandfather in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and enjoyed country living which was typical, with running water from the <span class="DLF">fountain</span> in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">horse stable</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> - or actually inside of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> kept the horses - and once and awhile a cow... some chickens.</sentence><sentence id="86">So that was our summer vacation and our summer treat.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I remember the mid-twenties when radio became popular.</sentence><sentence id="88">And I remember - I must have been about ten years old when I started building a radio receiver and you had to string a wire across the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span>, or somewhere where you could possibly hang up an antenna - and had a little crystal with a needle on it - fashioned a radio receiver.</sentence><sentence id="89">That was quite an accomplishment in those days.</sentence><sentence id="90">Otherwise, the pleasures were very simple.</sentence><sentence id="91">You played soccer with the kids - ball of any form - ball games of any form.</sentence><sentence id="92">But, all in all, it was a relatively simple existence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: So then tell me about <span class="BUILDING">schooling</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: <span class="BUILDING">School</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Yea.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: Well I entered a Jewish parochial(ph) school - a <span class="BUILDING">day school</span> at the age of... I was still five, not quite six when I entered <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">And that was a religious atmosphere.</sentence><sentence id="125">Boys and girls were separate in different <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> -- and we had both our religious education as well as secular education during the nine years of <span class="BUILDING">day school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">And one of the things that was routine there, that you started languages at an early age.</sentence><sentence id="127">At the age of seven you started French and the age of eight you started English.</sentence><sentence id="128">So every one of the children had two languages to be fairly well versed in.</sentence><sentence id="129">In addition to it, of course, you learned Hebrew and the Bible, and some of the Talmud.</sentence><sentence id="130">So it was a full day.</sentence><sentence id="131">Started at 8:00 o'clock in the morning and usually went to 3 or 4 in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="132">So it was a very intensive study course.</sentence><sentence id="133">And it was routine.</sentence><sentence id="134">It wasn't unusual in those days.</sentence><sentence id="135">And then after the ninth grade I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because there was no other <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> available, and there we, again, continued our language classes, and naturally mathematics and physics.</sentence><sentence id="136">Then, if you wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, you had to also have a course in Latin.</sentence><sentence id="137">You had to pass a Latin examination in order to enter <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">And as you might know, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in Europe, at least in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, led directly to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">There was no such thing as <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">You had to be prepared to enter the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> at the end of the twelfth grade - when you were eighteen.</sentence><sentence id="141">And so from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, directly we went to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">In those days, that was during the good old days of the German Republic.</sentence><sentence id="143">There was a real democratic government to which, I guess, the Germans never got quite use to, but at least you had a great deal of freedom in those days, politically and otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="144">There was a very liberal education and a very comfortable existence because people were really not polarized in those days.</sentence><sentence id="145">That was between 1924 and 1930.</sentence><sentence id="146">The life was quite comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="147">There was very little friction amongst the various groups of the population, and it wasn't until the Nazi Party started the activities when very violent demonstrations occurred, and the Communists on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Nazis on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> were shooting each other and killing each other during these demonstrations.</sentence><sentence id="148">That was the beginning of the violence really, in the late 30's.</sentence><sentence id="149">And, of course, it continued until 33 when Hitler took over altogether.</sentence><sentence id="150">So those were dangerous times.</sentence><sentence id="151">And you could tell by the early 30's that the future of the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was at great risk.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Tell me more about that... I mean, from a personal perspective.</sentence><sentence id="182">Tell me changes that you saw.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="185">A: Well, primarily, the agitation of the Nazi Party which at the very beginning derived most of their appeal by promising the general population to take over all the Jewish businesses and take away their wealth, which they supposedly had, and sold their ideas primarily with anti- Semitism, which was quite easy to do because the economic situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very bad, and jobs were hard to come by.</sentence><sentence id="186">So enough people who were looking for some free giveaways for their benefit, so that the idea of the Nazis tried to make popular fell on very fertile ground.</sentence><sentence id="187">And you could tell that the mood of the population changed steadily and gradually.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: And you saw a distinct change and increase in anti-Semitism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Oh, yea, very definitely... very definitely.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: And what kinds of specific incidents stand out in your memory?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Well, personally I don't have any stories to tell of any threats, but the usual attitude of youngsters already, let's say, was different.</sentence><sentence id="198">However, while I was at the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> between 27 and 1930, I personally had no real problems of any sort.</sentence><sentence id="199">Everybody was still, in those days, very friendly and perfectly congenial; except you knew several of the classmates were members of a nationalistic group.</sentence><sentence id="200">You knew they were members, some of them became members of the Nazi Party.</sentence><sentence id="201">There were still a fair number of right wing groups that wanted the Kaiser back.</sentence><sentence id="202">And so between those two right wing political Camps there was considerable friction as well.</sentence><sentence id="203">And the worst part was that the political parties increased every year and ended up, I think it was approximately 26 political parties that went to election day.</sentence><sentence id="204">So there was really no majority anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="205">They had to make friends with strange bedfellows Sometimes to get their votes together.</sentence><sentence id="206">But one of the difficulty of the German political system at that time was that the split in 26 different parties made matters a great deal worse and made governing almost impossible.</sentence><sentence id="207">In addition to that, of course, the attitudes of the people had changed.</sentence><sentence id="208">I still remember very early, as you may know, that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had a social security system even in those days that started after the First World War, where people got unemployment benefits.</sentence><sentence id="209">And I quite clearly recall a conversation that I listened to on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> where a couple of fellows talked about the pay they were getting for the job.</sentence><sentence id="210">And they said, "Ralph(ph), I almost get just as much from social security, but get unemployment compensation, that doesn't pay for me to work even."</sentence><sentence id="211">So that added to... started even then.</sentence><sentence id="212">I've never forgotten the strange idea that people do prefer to take a handout rather than earn it by working.</sentence><sentence id="213">It was quite an eye opener and I've never forgotten it.</sentence><sentence id="214">It's amazing how these ideas took hold very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="215">On the other hand, the ideals of democracy didn't sink in very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="216">They have never quite gotten to that point.</sentence><sentence id="217">They still preferred to be told what to do and be managed rather than to participate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: After... At some point in the 1930's, you were tutoring.</sentence><sentence id="240">Tell me about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Well, I... Since we were not particularly wealthy by any means, I had to - well, I wanted to and I more or less had to help pay for my University tuition.</sentence><sentence id="244">And in order to earn some money for that I was tutoring students, and help them do their homework, sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="245">And I was able to pay most of my tuition with the money that I earned that way.</sentence><sentence id="246">Tuition was very minimal anyway because <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was owned by the state and so actually the fees you had to pay were very small by comparison - no comparison what one has to pay today, even at a <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">So I was able to finance my <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> education pretty well - fairly closely anyway.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: But during this time period, when was this, and you were tutoring people who weren't Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="256">They were not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="257">That's right, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="258">Well, there was still a large group of the population who was not influenced by the Nazi ideas and continued to be perfectly friendly, and have - not having any prejudice.</sentence><sentence id="259">So I was able to tutor non-Jewish students til - close to the time I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, which was 1935.</sentence><sentence id="260">And, of course, the first couple of years of the Nazi regime, things were not nearly as difficult as they became later on.</sentence><sentence id="261">The people that I worked for... well they became a little bit anxious towards the end and, you know, they wasn't going to announce my activities.</sentence><sentence id="262">And they weren't going to tell everybody who was teaching their - was tutoring their children.</sentence><sentence id="263">But it was getting more and more difficult, and people had to be more and more careful not to give away their liberal ideas.</sentence><sentence id="264">That wasn't very appreciated by the neighbors very frequently.</sentence><sentence id="265">And during the years of my <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> training, right after 1933, many of the students - well I wouldn't say many, but a fair number of the students appeared in their storm trooper uniforms during classes.</sentence><sentence id="266">And some of the professors - some of the doctors who were teaching appeared in their uniform with a white coat over it.</sentence><sentence id="267">| remember one or two of these students in uniform even brought their gun and holster along and had their (rollover-ph) strapped to the side all through the lectures, which wasn't particularly comforting.</sentence><sentence id="268">But, we got by.</sentence><sentence id="269">I go along.</sentence><sentence id="270">I was able to attend the <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">I was able to do the practical work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> - on the <span class="DLF">wards</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">I even was allowed to deliver babies, which was part of our curriculum.</sentence><sentence id="273">So all-in-all, I personally was not restricted particularly.</sentence><sentence id="274">Of course, one was always very careful not to step on anybody's toes.</sentence><sentence id="275">But, all- in-all, I was able to get by reasonably well and was able to finish <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, which was, as I said, in 35, two years after Hitler had taken over.</sentence><sentence id="276">On the other hand, you had to face every day the signs on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> with all the Nazi propaganda which was anti-Semitic, by promising the people all the supposed wealth that the Jews had.</sentence><sentence id="277">They got more and more followers and one could feel that the situation was getting more and more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="278">But nobody ever would have dreamt that it would lead to extremes like it actually did.</sentence><sentence id="279">And politically one always thought, well the economic situation being what it was, that Hitler was never going to Survive another winter because he wouldn't be able to feed his people, and give them anything of what he had promised them.</sentence><sentence id="280">But he had more staying power than anybody ever thought.</sentence><sentence id="281">So it became quite clear then, by the time I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, that I had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="282">And interestingly enough, in those days the Nazis were perfectly satisfied to have you get out Of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">When I finished my state board, which in the Germany system comes before the medical degree, you graduate without a degree actually.</sentence><sentence id="284">You get a certificate that you have passed the state board that you're entitled to practice medicine, but you do not have a doctoral degree - a doctor title either.</sentence><sentence id="285">And you can practice medicine - I presume it's still this way - without a doctoral over there.</sentence><sentence id="286">When I finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> and I got my certificate that I was entitled to practice medicine, I was told then right there that you won't be allowed to practice medicine in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> - and we won't - you can take your examine for the doctor, which required a thesis and another exam, but we won't give you your diploma until after you've left the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">So that was an open invitation to get out, which was, in looking back, was favorable to help us make up our mind because very few people could make up their mind since there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go unless you happen to have relatives in <span class="REGION">foreign countries</span>, particularly in either North or <span class="REGION">South America</span>, which was relatively safe.</sentence><sentence id="288">totally helpless then because the economic situation was the same and we were to the point where nobody was allowed as a foreigner to earn any money.</sentence><sentence id="289">So there was a good reason to leave and to find some way, if you could.</sentence><sentence id="290">So when I got this invitation to go to get myself a M.D. degree elsewhere, I accepted that and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, which had reciprocity in those days, probably still now, with <span class="BUILDING">German medical schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">So on the basis of my German certificate, I could enroll in the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss University</span>, write a thesis, take and exam and then get a doctor degree from the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">And, fortunately, I was able to do that and... On the other hand, I had no idea where I was going to go after that.</sentence><sentence id="293">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to practice medicine because every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, particularly in Europe, was completely closed off.</sentence><sentence id="294">If you, as a foreigner, earned any money in any of the <span class="REGION">European countries</span>, you were immediately expelled.</sentence><sentence id="295">And when it came to practicing medicine, it was was totally impossible.</sentence><sentence id="296">In <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, for example, you had to go back to get your high school diploma before you could... and then go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="297">And the other thing was that they wouldn't let you have a citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="298">The Swiss had a good system.</sentence><sentence id="299">The required period of time that you were... to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was five years.</sentence><sentence id="300">So they let you stay there for 4'4 years and then said, "Now you gotta go."</sentence><sentence id="301">So you never were able to accomplish a stay of five years so you could apply for citizenship, even if you had gone back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">So that was pretty much the same in all the <span class="REGION">European countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">Since the economic situation was bad, they had unemployment which was very high.</sentence><sentence id="304">They tried to keep any foreigner out of the <span class="BUILDING">labor market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">So unless you had relatives elsewhere, in North or <span class="REGION">South America</span>, you had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="306">So when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, I really had no plan.</sentence><sentence id="307">I had no idea where I could possibly go afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="308">Still, I suppose, I wasn't really at that point to be desperate yet, and I wasn't really sure what would happen.</sentence><sentence id="309">But while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> then, for my last semester to get my M.D. degree from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, I met an old friend of mine again who was a medical student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> for a period of time.</sentence><sentence id="310">He was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">And while I was there, at one point he asked me for a loan of a small amount of money which I had no idea what he was going to do with.</sentence><sentence id="312">And it ended up that he took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with that money to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where he shot a Nazi official.</sentence><sentence id="313">The Nazis had sent their organizer to organize a Nazi Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">And somehow or other he heard about him - he knew about him - and apparently this fellow as fairly successful in recruiting some Swiss, a small number - not a really large number I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="315">But he was recruiting people to foil the Nazi Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">And the Germans, of course, would have loved to take over <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="317">So he went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> and shot this Nazi gaulietier(ph) - killed him.</sentence><sentence id="318">At the time he had the idea of committing suicide.</sentence><sentence id="319">He was depressed.</sentence><sentence id="320">He was ill and all that.</sentence><sentence id="321">But after he had shot this man, he gave himself up and the next morning I was staying at the <span class="BUILDING">rooming house</span> where during those semester months and got a call from the police to ask me to come over there to the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">Of course it was not unusual in those days, whenever you were in a <span class="COUNTRY">foreign country</span> you were always subject to police checks, and you always had to register with the police wherever you were.</sentence><sentence id="323">So I did go that morning and, to make the story short, they asked me about this friend of mine and wanted to know what I knew about him and all that.</sentence><sentence id="324">And I finally said to them, "What's happened to him?"</sentence><sentence id="325">They said, "Did you see the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span> today?"</sentence><sentence id="326">I says, "No, I didn't see a newspaper today."</sentence><sentence id="327">So they said, "Well, we'd just like to know what you knew about him."</sentence><sentence id="328">I said, "Well, what happened?</sentence><sentence id="329">Did he commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="330">I know he's been depressed."</sentence><sentence id="331">Well finally, they said, "Well, he shot Gustov(ph)."</sentence><sentence id="332">I said, "What's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gustov</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="333">I had not idea who it was.</sentence><sentence id="334">I had never heard of him before.</sentence><sentence id="335">So anyway they realized that I was not an accomplice and I didn't have anything to do with it, but they had found my address in this <span class="BUILDING">students house</span> - in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> - and they checked out every <span class="NPIP">angle</span>, of course.</sentence><sentence id="336">And so it ended up that they kept my connection with this man totally quiet and never - the Nazis never found out about the fact that I had any contact with this man.</sentence><sentence id="337">They were looking for everybody, of course, that they could possibly accuse of accomplice...of being an accomplice.</sentence><sentence id="338">And nothing ever happened to my parents during that time, but of course I never dared to go back on account of that.</sentence><sentence id="339">However, the day of the trial in the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Court</span>, my testimony was read and the next day the Nazis came to my parents" <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and looked for any kind of evidence that I had been in a political scheme of sorts, or party, or anything.</sentence><sentence id="340">And that was quite uncomfortable for my parents, of course.</sentence><sentence id="341">So the idea not to go back was justified and I would have been in trouble very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="342">And in addition to that I probably would have stayed too long - to the point where I would have been deported myself.</sentence><sentence id="343">So in a way, this friend of mine whose name happened to be Frankfurter, by killing this Gustov(ph), saved my life actually.</sentence><sentence id="344">I would have probably never gotten through alive otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="345">So he was then sentenced to eighteen years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by the Swiss.</sentence><sentence id="346">Also the Germans, of course, agitated as much as they could and wanted as heavy a sentence as possible.</sentence><sentence id="347">And he was kept in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> until the day after the Germans surrendered.</sentence><sentence id="348">The Swiss let him go the day after <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> surrendered in 45.</sentence><sentence id="349">So that was really, for me, a great life saver.</sentence><sentence id="350">On the other hand, I was stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> then with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="351">All I had with me was one suit and there was things you couldn't... You couldn't send out much money any more - out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="352">Just a minimum was permissible.</sentence><sentence id="353">So I didn't really know where to go next.</sentence><sentence id="354">Nevertheless, I went to one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> - <span class="BUILDING">University Hospital</span> - just to volunteer in order to, you know, be occupied and to at least learn something more after finishing <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">And there I had the first, well actually this was the second, remarkable incident that helped me.</sentence><sentence id="356">The first one was Frankfurter's murder of Gustov(ph) and the second was that I volunteered at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and, not knowing what to do next and where my next money would come from, one of the residents at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> asked me if I would be willing to help her out because her finance had been a resident at this small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where the chief had to go to his annual military service.</sentence><sentence id="357">Every Swiss up to a certain age had to spend three weeks in the military and the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was due to leave and all he had was one resident to care for the eighty patients of this small <span class="BUILDING">district hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">And her fiance panicked.</sentence><sentence id="359">He ran away, which embarrassed the family terribly, of course.</sentence><sentence id="360">He was a nice Swiss boy but I guess he didn't have much guts, and he was afraid to be stuck with eighty patients not knowing how he would take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="361">So this young lady asked me if I would be willing to take his <span class="NPIP">place</span> because everybody was terribly embarrassed and the doctor, the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, needed somebody to come in.</sentence><sentence id="362">So I said, "Sure.</sentence><sentence id="363">I'd be glad to if I can get permission."</sentence><sentence id="364">Whatever you did in those days in these <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>... If you wanted to work, you had to have a police permit.</sentence><sentence id="365">So I said, "Well, if I can get the permit, I'd be glad to do it, of course.</sentence><sentence id="366">I'd love to."</sentence><sentence id="367">So what happened... She got me on the phone.</sentence><sentence id="368">The chief of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was at the other end.</sentence><sentence id="369">He says, "Well, do you want to take the job?"</sentence><sentence id="370">I said, "Sure." "</sentence><sentence id="371">Alright.</sentence><sentence id="372">Such and such a time there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">You get to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and you come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Choffingen(ph</span>) and I'll meet you at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="374">I hadn't the slightest idea where it was and I really didn't care either.</sentence><sentence id="375">I ran to my <span class="BUILDING">rooming house</span> and packed my things, went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and I got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Choffingen(ph</span>) and I left my suitcase at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> because I didn't really believe I could get a job there.</sentence><sentence id="376">So I walked out to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">It was outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> - a little small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, actually - and the chief met me there.</sentence><sentence id="378">He said, "Okay, here's a white coat.</sentence><sentence id="379">Here's a piece of paper and pencil.</sentence><sentence id="380">You can speak some Swiss German?"</sentence><sentence id="381">I says, "Well, I'll get by I guess."</sentence><sentence id="382">He said, "Okay, let's go."</sentence><sentence id="383">So he made rounds with eighty patients and he said, "Goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="384">I'l 1 see you in three weeks."</sentence><sentence id="385">So there I was with a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> on my hands and I said, "Well, you've just got to wait a moment and call up the police chief.</sentence><sentence id="386">I can't just take a job without a permit."</sentence><sentence id="387">So he did call the police and says, "Well, I'm leaving for a military service.</sentence><sentence id="388">I've got to have somebody to take care of my patients.</sentence><sentence id="389">You've got to give me a permit."</sentence><sentence id="390">So he did.</sentence><sentence id="391">And I was able to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> and manage reasonably well.</sentence><sentence id="392">And when he came back after three weeks, said "Well, would you like to stay here?"</sentence><sentence id="393">I said, "Sure I would." "</sentence><sentence id="394">Well," he said, "I'll see what I can do."</sentence><sentence id="395">He had some good connections so fortunately he got the permission for me to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="396">But this had to be renewed every three months - from three months to three months.</sentence><sentence id="397">You had to go through a rigmarole where you had to get permission renewed that you could stay and could work.</sentence><sentence id="398">So he did that for me and there was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="399">I got along beautifully there and people were as friendly as you can possibly imagine.</sentence><sentence id="400">And I enjoyed my work and I made friends.</sentence><sentence id="401">But still it was no solution for me because I knew that wouldn't last.</sentence><sentence id="402">And sure enough, after a year and a half, the Swiss finally said, "That's it.</sentence><sentence id="403">No more."</sentence><sentence id="404">They gave all kinds of reasons.</sentence><sentence id="405">First it was the unemployment was too high.</sentence><sentence id="406">I couldn't stay.</sentence><sentence id="407">And then he next thing was the "too many foreigners in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>."</sentence><sentence id="408">And they gave me a date when I had to leave no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="409">And they said, "Well, we'll give you three months to figure out where to go and to find some other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but got to leave."</sentence><sentence id="410">There was no choice in the matter.</sentence><sentence id="411">So that was all fine while it lasted and it was a big help, but.... It was a rare opportunity because very few, if anyone, had been able to work in a foreign country in Europe during those years.</sentence><sentence id="412">But still I then had to look for a more permanent arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="413">So my next idea was to try to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, which began to take in some of the European Jews, but there were only two ways of entering <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days during the British control.</sentence><sentence id="414">You had either be a farmer proving that you had so many months of training in farming, or you had to be a capitalist.</sentence><sentence id="415">That meant that you had to have a thousand British Pounds in your name on the bank account.</sentence><sentence id="416">And if you had that, then you could get a certificate from the British to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">On the other hand, this was controlled by the Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="418">The Zionist organization had available a certain number of these certificates and they could give those certificates to anyone who they wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="419">So the Zionist organization invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel(ph</span>) to appear before the committee and decide whether they would give me that permission.</sentence><sentence id="420">That was the end of 36.</sentence><sentence id="421">And so when I appeared there they asked me, "Are you a member of the Zionist Organization?</sentence><sentence id="422">Do you have any money?"</sentence><sentence id="423">So I told them, "I just have those few francs that I earned here in the last year, and I'm not a member of the Zionist Organization.</sentence><sentence id="424">Observant Jew."</sentence><sentence id="425">Zionists are not observant generally.</sentence><sentence id="426">They said, "Well, you're not a member of the Zionist Organization, don't have any money -- nothing doing.</sentence><sentence id="427">We will not give you are certificate."</sentence><sentence id="428">So that was hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="429">So then when I had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> I had luckily been given a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">Usually they did not give you any visa unless they knew you could go back somewheres else afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="431">So, somehow or other they did give me a visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="432">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> hoping that I would be able to get some type of arrangement where I could go to one of the <span class="REGION">South American countries</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in those days would not admit anyone that did not have an affidavit of a relative - had to be a relative, and had to be a relative who had sufficient amount of money to be able to guarantee that you would not become a public charge for five years - until you became a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="433">So unless you had a relative, and unless you had somebody that sufficient amount of means, you have no chance of getting a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">And I didn't have any relatives.</sentence><sentence id="435">I knew of nobody at the time and so there was no chance to consider the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> even.</sentence><sentence id="436">And I went to the various <span class="BUILDING">consulates</span> or <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> of different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="REGION">South America</span> where you could get a visa depending on how much money you had.</sentence><sentence id="437">If you had a lot of money, you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="438">If you had a little less, you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">If you had a little less, you could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="440">But wherever you went you had to pay a fair amount of money to buy a visa and I just didn't have enough for any of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="441">The only one I could afford to buy a visa from would have been <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">So I started to learn Spanish because you had to take your exam there in Spanish and all that.</sentence><sentence id="443">And I figured, well eventually that's what I would have to do - go to <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span>.</sentence><sentence id="444">And I was just living on money I had earned in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> during that year and a half and I was just living on money I had earned in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> during that year and a half which got me by fairly well; not in luxury by any means, but I somehow managed.</sentence><sentence id="445">So that process of trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> took about six months and, except for <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span>, there was no <span class="DLF">opening</span> that I could have possibly found.</sentence><sentence id="446">And just at that point my parents who were still living at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>... another coincidence... happened to receive a family tree from one of... from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> - from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">One of the distant relatives had gone through the trouble of making a complete family tree of their relatives who went back to the late 1700's, early 1800's, and, lo and behold, in this family tree my father then found his - a cousin.</sentence><sentence id="448">And so he got in touch with him, and I got in touch with a friend of mine - a schoolmate of mine who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> - and he started to talk to this relative who was instrumental in bringing quite a few people over, and already had felt that he committed himself to take care of so many people that he couldn't well afford another one.</sentence><sentence id="449">But, eventually he relented and did get me an affidavit, which was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="450">And I very happily took that to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and he said, "That's fine.</sentence><sentence id="451">But we won't be able to process this until you are... until a certain date at which time your German passport will have expired.</sentence><sentence id="452">So we can't give you the visa.</sentence><sentence id="453">We have to go and get another passport."</sentence><sentence id="454">Well, that was not a small matter in those days either because you didn't trust even the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">But anyway I got up my courage one day and went there and applied for another passport.</sentence><sentence id="456">Miraculously, I came across a fellow who was perfectly friendly, and he said, "How much time do you want?"</sentence><sentence id="457">I says, "Well, whatever time - three months would be enough.</sentence><sentence id="458">Whatever you can give me." "</sentence><sentence id="459">T'll give you a year's passport.</sentence><sentence id="460">I don't mind" - and renewed my passport, shook my hands, says, "Good luck to you," and I was ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">So happily I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">United States Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> with my passport.</sentence><sentence id="462">He says, "Yes, well that's fine, but we don't have any quota number for you anymore.</sentence><sentence id="463">No quota number now."</sentence><sentence id="464">So he said, "We'll let you know when you... when we find another quota number."</sentence><sentence id="465">So in the meantime I had to go to the French Police to get a permit every month to stay another month..., another month...until I was able to leave.</sentence><sentence id="466">And that got - those permissions after, you have to give a puboir(ph) - you know... had a little hand, a little bit under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="467">And anyway, I did get that police permission finally for the... the whole year it took me to finally get the visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="468">So I did get a call after a month or six weeks that they had a quota number for me and I did get my visa.</sentence><sentence id="469">So after one year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> I finally managed to get my visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and was able to get a ticket on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, and July 4th of 1938 I managed to arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="470">So the worst was over at least at this point.</sentence><sentence id="471">However, I had very little luck helping my family - my parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="701">A: Well, actually, I came over here in 38 and... in July of 1938... and actually all I knew was that everybody was trying desperately to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="702">And in 38 deportation actually hadn't really started yet.</sentence><sentence id="703">People were arrested frequently, but then they were released again.</sentence><sentence id="704">So I did not know just how bad the situation was.</sentence><sentence id="705">I did realize, like most everybody else, that one should bring out one's family if it was at all possible, but no details really were known at that time - at least not to me.</sentence><sentence id="706">I don't think too many people realized what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="707">And in 38 it really - in the summer of 38 - things weren't as bad because the worst started only after November, 38, when Kristall Nacht occurred - when the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burned and <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were looted and destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="708">So this is actually the time when everybody realized they had to get out.</sentence><sentence id="709">And until then L.... Well, first of all I was busy trying to pass my exams so and do... so I would be able to get the license to practice in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">So I was not as anxious to... about my family.</sentence><sentence id="711">I didn't realize how difficult the situation was.</sentence><sentence id="712">And, actually I had no money either to do much for them.</sentence><sentence id="713">The only financial support I had was a... the money that I received for a camera which I had bought over - one of the - the only valuable thing that I think I remember must have gotten about $250 for it in those days, which was a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="714">And I had to live on that for quite a while before I would have earned anything else.</sentence><sentence id="715">So I was handicapped.</sentence><sentence id="716">I had no relatives here actually.</sentence><sentence id="717">The only one was the cousin of my father's who brought me over - gave me the affidavit.</sentence><sentence id="718">And so I was really handicapped to doing anything, but I did start talking to people to get affidavits for my parents and for my sis.... I had two sisters who had six children between them.</sentence><sentence id="719">And there I had some distant relatives.</sentence><sentence id="720">My brother-in-law had some distant relatives.</sentence><sentence id="721">So, trying to get something done as much as possible, but it took me until 1939 to get some relatives to try to get affidavits for them and get them to come over here.</sentence><sentence id="722">And actually I had even made arrangements for my parents to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">I was able to find somebody who was able to arrange - put some money in their name in a <span class="BUILDING">British bank</span> - again the same old arrangement - so they would come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="724">Then in September, 39, the war started which cut off every possibility for anything - for any of them to come out.</sentence><sentence id="725">And so that, that was quite a blow.</sentence><sentence id="726">As it happened then, my father took ill suddenly in December of 39 and died of a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="727">They had to give up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="728">They had to sell it for a minimal amount to an Aryan, and so they moved to some little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> somewheres.</sentence><sentence id="729">And with all that I'm sure it was too much.</sentence><sentence id="730">My father was only 67 then and he had a heart attack and died.</sentence><sentence id="731">So then I tried to get my mother out at last, and the only way to do that in those days was to get an <span class="DLF">Italian steamship line</span> to take them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santo Domingo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="732">And I did manage to get a ticket on the 1 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamship</span> from - to - to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santo Domingo</span>, and hoping that from there I could bring her over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">So the day came when she should have gotten onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> - taken a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">And nothing happened, so I finally, through a sister who was still living then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, one of my sister, I found out that she took ill early in 1940 and had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and never left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">She had cholangitis, if that means anything to you.</sentence><sentence id="736">And there were no antibiotics in those days, so she never survived.</sentence><sentence id="737">So I almost succeeded in getting her out, but didn't quite make it.</sentence><sentence id="738">Then, one sister had escaped with her family to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and they thought they were quite safe, of course, until the Nazis took over <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and invaded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="739">So they were the first ones to be deported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French concentration camp</span>;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="825">A: Well, he was the one friend that really would have liked to keep me there if he could have - 2 if he had been able to who.</sentence><sentence id="826">He was a real good Swiss citizen who was - well - connected to the various military people in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and he was just as helpful to me as he could be.</sentence><sentence id="827">He, as a matter of... He was... He had to report.</sentence><sentence id="828">He had to make an annual report of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">And the first year I was there I worked on that report and completed it.</sentence><sentence id="830">And then after the Swiss insisted I leave in 37, he had me come back in 38 while I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to make up the next year's - the annual report for the following year - just to help me out and get me a little extra money.</sentence><sentence id="831">And this was a remarkably fine, fine man, and his wife equally generous and good hearted.</sentence><sentence id="832">They would have done anything possible that they could have done to help me.</sentence><sentence id="833">But they too, of course, were limited in their ability to do things.</sentence><sentence id="834">And after the war we renewed our contact and we visited with them in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> several times after I got settled and was able to afford a trip to Europe which we first did in 1962 - the first time I could manage to get away and take my wife over to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="835">And so this has been a very close friendship.</sentence><sentence id="836">They both have died since then, but I'm still in contact with the son of this Dr. Meyer who is a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="837">He has been visiting with us and - in <span class="COUNTRY">Maine</span> at the time - and we visited at their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">He still feels very close, though he is thirty years younger than I am, but we are a very close friendship still and he calls from time to time.</sentence><sentence id="839">He doesn't like to write letters so he calls from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">So it's quite remarkable.</sentence><sentence id="841">And one of the nice things that - when they visited us in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> - was that they came on a Friday and on a Friday night I said to him, "Well, you have to bear with us.</sentence><sentence id="842">We have special things we say or sing on a Friday night to celebrate the Sabbath."</sentence><sentence id="843">So he says, "Well I don't know much about it but my wife does."</sentence><sentence id="844">She is a Swiss schoolteacher and she spent two years in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and she knew more Jewish songs than I did.</sentence><sentence id="845">And so they had a great time celebrating the Friday night with us.</sentence><sentence id="846">That was a particularly heartwarming experience.</sentence><sentence id="847">So like everywheres else you find good people, and some that are not quite as good, but it's heartwarming to have this friendship.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="877">A: Well, the.... My experience in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> was also very wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="878">When I started out I - being totally alone of course - I only had two old schoolmates of mine I had contact with and who helped me out; one of whom was a dentist who took me in and I slept in his <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for the first few months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the - during the hottest months of the year of course - on the bottom of one of those 50 story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">But that was a big help even at that.</sentence><sentence id="880">And I use to get by on about $.55 a day of food with horn(ph) for breakfast and lunch, and rolls and bananas for supper.</sentence><sentence id="881">It was very inexpensive in those days.</sentence><sentence id="882">And till I got my first job - when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> I had also spent some of the time in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> so I would at least learn something and maybe get some connection.</sentence><sentence id="883">And one of the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was Hospitale(ph-French) St. Antoinne, and I happened to work in the X-ray Department there.</sentence><sentence id="884">And the Chief of the <span class="BUILDING">Radiology</span> at that time had some contact in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">So after I had worked there for several months - working mean following them around and I wasn't much help I don't think, but I learned something - this Chief of the Radiology Department had a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="886">So when I left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> he gave me a letter along to this particular friend of his and through him I got my first job as a resident in <span class="BUILDING">radiology</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New 3 Rochelle</span>, New York.</sentence><sentence id="887">Unfortunately, the.... It was a strange situation where the Chief of the Radiology Department at the <span class="BUILDING">New Rochelle Hospital</span> had as his associate his wife and it was not a very healthy situation.</sentence><sentence id="888">There was a lot of friction there.</sentence><sentence id="889">And I managed to stay there for six months, but after that, that just was a difficult - so difficult - the first and only time I gave up and left there.</sentence><sentence id="890">But as it happens, there's another one of those many coincidences that I have to be thankful for.</sentence><sentence id="891">I found out through a friend I had met in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> that a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> was looking for a resident - a similar situation where a young man had run away because he couldn't stand the responsibility of the work, or the situation, and also about an eighty bed hospital for chronic diseases.</sentence><sentence id="892">And so I heard that this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> needed somebody.</sentence><sentence id="893">Because that was ... Because in those days, in 1939, - 38, 39 there was a surplus of doctors everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="894">Nobody needed doctors.</sentence><sentence id="895">People didn't go to annual checkups.</sentence><sentence id="896">People didn't see a doctor unless they absolutely had to and they were very sick.</sentence><sentence id="897">And doctors couldn't do too much in those days.</sentence><sentence id="898">There were no antibiotics and medications were few and far between.</sentence><sentence id="899">And so it was very difficult to get any <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> appointment, particularly, as I said, there was a surplus and nobody wanted a foreign graduate - a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="900">They didn't need them in most instances and they would try anything to get somebody else - an American graduate, rather than to take in a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="901">So it was very difficult to get any <span class="BUILDING">job</span>.</sentence><sentence id="902">So anyway, I did find out about this opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and a friend took me up by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="903">They happened to make a trip anyway from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="904">And so the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> - well, they played a little hard to get at first, but they finally gave me the job which was the first one when I earned $100 a month, which was a lot of money in those days.</sentence><sentence id="905">And I stayed there for two years.</sentence><sentence id="906">And during that time I was again looking for an opportunity to practice - to start a private practice because I couldn't stay in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> forever.</sentence><sentence id="907">It was always very protective, but it wasn't - you couldn't earn a real living that way - or support a family.</sentence><sentence id="908">So anyway I stayed there for two years and then looked for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to practice and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> was hopeless like any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> - any big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="909">Everybody wanted to be in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> then already.</sentence><sentence id="910">And unless you had enough money to support yourself for two years, you just couldn't even start.</sentence><sentence id="911">Doctors were a poor credit risk.</sentence><sentence id="912">No <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> would give you a loan.</sentence><sentence id="913">So unless you had somebody with money or relatives or family, or good connections, you just couldn't think of starting, particularly around a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="914">So I did talk to some of the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> that <span class="BUILDING">Tufts Medical School</span> - was in those days New England Medical Center.</sentence><sentence id="915">And they said, "Well if we hear of something we'll let you know, but in the <span class="REGION">Boston area</span> there is no place that needs a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="916">There's just no chance."</sentence><sentence id="917">And the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> wouldn't, as a foreign graduate, they wouldn't - weren't too anxious to give you hospital appointments either, even as a visiting or attending physician of course.</sentence><sentence id="918">So it was a very difficult time.</sentence><sentence id="919">And as I said, the need of doctors was minimal.</sentence><sentence id="920">People didn't go for their routine checkups.</sentence><sentence id="921">They didn't need doctors that much and there was no army or navy medical corps that needed help.</sentence><sentence id="922">The <span class="BUILDING">Veterans Administration Hospital</span> didn't exist in those days, so the number of doctors that were needed was quite limited - was totally different before the war, and there was a total change after the war, when suddenly there was a shortage.</sentence><sentence id="923">So finally they called me one day and said, "Well there's a place in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> that needs a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="924">I had no idea where it was or what it was.</sentence><sentence id="925">So anyway I said, "Sure.</sentence><sentence id="926">I'll go and see what the situation is."</sentence><sentence id="927">And since I only wanted to go into practice anyway I was able to buy a 1936 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dodge</span> for $300.</sentence><sentence id="928">That was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="929">It was one of those oil burners.</sentence><sentence id="930">We had to stop every hundred miles to fill up the oil... and drove up to <span class="COUNTRY">Maine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="931">And there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on 4 the <span class="DLF">Canadian border</span> of 900 people.</sentence><sentence id="932">And so I drove up there and, sure enough, they needed a doctor badly.</sentence><sentence id="933">There [were] two people that hadn't seen a doctor in several weeks.</sentence><sentence id="934">The doctor that they had had left for the army because that was... end of 1940... and he was very happy to find an excuse to leave there.</sentence><sentence id="935">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of 900 - mostly lumberjacks.</sentence><sentence id="936">And all said, "Sure you can come.</sentence><sentence id="937">We would love to have you.</sentence><sentence id="938">We need a doctor badly.</sentence><sentence id="939">You can rent a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for $20 a month.</sentence><sentence id="940">All you have to do is cut your own <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> to heat it."</sentence><sentence id="941">And they said, "Well there's an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> here with 300 children.</sentence><sentence id="942">You can take out all the tonsils you want."</sentence><sentence id="943">I said, "Well that's too bad.</sentence><sentence id="944">That's not my <span class="DLF">line</span>."...</sentence><sentence id="945">Internal medicine, but not in - not in the business of taking out tonsils.</sentence><sentence id="946">Well, they says, "You can do physicals for the Immigration Service.</sentence><sentence id="947">You get $5 for each physical, for every Canadian that comes across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and wants to work in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> has to have a physical."</sentence><sentence id="948">So... well.... It wasn't too tempting and I said, "Well, it's too bad I have a New York license, I have a Massachusetts license, but I don't have a Maine license.</sentence><sentence id="949">So I would like to accept your offer but I don't think I can take it."</sentence><sentence id="950">He said, "Well you go down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span>, <span class="REGION">Maine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="951">They'll fix it up for you.</sentence><sentence id="952">They'll get you a temporary license so you can come up here."</sentence><sentence id="953">Well, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> and, fortunately, they couldn't get me a license.</sentence><sentence id="954">They had to take a <span class="BUILDING">state board</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="955">But while they were talking to me they said, "How would you like to stay here for a few months as an intern," after I have been a resident for two years, "and you have a better chance to pass your state boards if you work right in the state.</sentence><sentence id="956">You can hopefully do better that way."</sentence><sentence id="957">And there was no pay.</sentence><sentence id="958">Interns did not get paid in those days - absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="959">They got <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board and uniform.</sentence><sentence id="960">That was it.</sentence><sentence id="961">So I said, well, it was a very very nice <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="962">I was very much impressed by it and it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of 60,000.</sentence><sentence id="963">I figured, well if 1 get acquainted, maybe that would be a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to settle.</sentence><sentence id="964">So I accepted and for six months I worked as an intern again, and took my state board in the meantime - in the middle of a horrible blizzard - but managed to squeeze by.</sentence><sentence id="965">And so when I finished the six months then as an intern, that was 41, and they offered me to stay as a resident, which again was paid $100 a month which was from nothing quite a bit of money.</sentence><sentence id="966">So | accepted and that was July of 41.</sentence><sentence id="967">And in December, war started - Pearl Harbor - in December of 41 and quite a few of the doctors left, went in the service, and so the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was very short handed.</sentence><sentence id="968">And so I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of course, and in those days the draft also started and not being a citizen at this point, I would have been drafted as a private.</sentence><sentence id="969">So the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> declared me essential.</sentence><sentence id="970">That got you out of the draft.</sentence><sentence id="971">And I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> until 44 when I got my citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="972">And then I applied for a commission in the service and then I entered the service here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in August of 1944 - another one of those hot months that I remember vividly.</sentence><sentence id="973">And I stayed most of my time I spent in <span class="COUNTRY">Alaska</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">Handed me a <span class="BUILDING">hundred bed hospital</span> to turn into a <span class="BUILDING">tuberculosis sanitarium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="975">So that's where a spent the war years - 40, 46.</sentence><sentence id="976">And then before I left <span class="REGION">Maine</span> they offered me an appointment as an attending at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">So naturally I went back and 48 years later I finally retired.</sentence><sentence id="978">But I certainly had a wonderful time there working with the people in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> and taking care of the Maine people - delightful.</sentence><sentence id="979">So L..
