You know, people laugh when I say "a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>"; but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> was the second largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> that was taken over--Vilna--by the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="77">But in that time, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.901111" long="23.979444">Kaunas</span> was a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, was the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>; the next one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span>--or as we Jewish people called it, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shavli</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">And in Hebrew, we referred to it as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shavli</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">We had a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, which was called <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium Bialik</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">It was a (unclear word) type of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, what as you started through <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Beth Sefer Chevra</span> for people who could not afford as much.</sentence><sentence id="82">There was a Yavner for very religious people who were ultra-orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="83">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, although everybody was orthodox, we did not have a conservative or reform.</sentence><sentence id="84">We just had <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span>; but we were Misnagdim, not Hasidim.</sentence><sentence id="85">What it means is, our people did not believe in the Rebbe, did not wear curlicues and the black clothing and the fur hat.</sentence><sentence id="86">Our family looked pretty much like an American family.</sentence><sentence id="87">My father did not cover his head just to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> or to make a prayer.</sentence><sentence id="88">So we had the <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> Yavner, we had a Fortshuler (ph) for people that were Yiddishkeit--you know, Bundistin [NB: socialists] that didn't believe in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="89">Then we had many <span class="BUILDING">cheders</span> where people just sent their children.</sentence><sentence id="90">They went to regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, to <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian school</span>; and then they went to learn customs and prayers in a <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: So you grew up this way.</sentence><sentence id="116">Tell us in growing up what happened then, what happened, how old were you when the Germans came and what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Also, I would like to remark [that] for a small--at this time--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which is not so big, we had quite a few <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">We had all the time <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish Theater</span> come; we had a Jewish paper, newspaper; we had Maccabee, which was a sport organization.</sentence><sentence id="121">We have every type of Zionist organization from the right to the left existing in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">When I grew up, as I said, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>; I happened to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasia Bialik</span> from <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> to the age of 12.</sentence><sentence id="123">At the age of 12, in 1940... You know, many people skipped that year.</sentence><sentence id="124">Even when I go out to speak to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I'm giving just a half hour, I cannot go into detail about history.</sentence><sentence id="125">But in 1940, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was occupied by the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="126">And that's when we were not allowed to study Hebrew anymore.</sentence><sentence id="127">All the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> had to study Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="128">At that point, the very wealthy of the community--the Burjui, as they called them--were deported to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">But ironically, these people lived through cold and hunger but nobody killed them.</sentence><sentence id="130">They survived, and many of them came now to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">My family, as I told you before, were Balabatish--which is comfortable, but not very rich.</sentence><sentence id="132">So we were allowed to stay.</sentence><sentence id="133">And in our business, the Communists put in like an overseer; but my parents were still running the business.</sentence><sentence id="134">Now, 1941, we heard before that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> already things are being bad for the Jews--Jews are made to leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and go away.</sentence><sentence id="135">I, as a child at the age of 12, had firsthand information about it; because in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> came what we called Platim--runaways-- people that escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">My mother's first cousin, her name was Regina Vlafsia (ph); I can't recall her husband's first name--they were children of a family by the name of Fabilisski.</sentence><sentence id="137">They were manufacturers for cloth in the city of _6d_, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">They had a lot of money, and somehow they bought their way out to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">And they came to our</sentence><sentence id="141"><span class="BUILDING">home</span>; and they told us that they were all made to leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and relocate their particular family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">This young couple did not know exactly what happened during that time, but we had gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>--my aunt also in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>--some letters from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, assuming they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, from this great uncle of my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="143">So we knew what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">But you don't think it will happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="145">I'm telling you the truth.</sentence><sentence id="146">You know, I make a smile with it, and I'm saying it because people don't realize that it can happen anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="147">If we don't learn from this part of history how it happened, it can happen anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="148">We lived so nice in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>--Jewish people, non- Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="149">The children played together, our parents did business together.</sentence><sentence id="150">We didn't think that our own neighbors are not going to stand by us and help us at the time of need.</sentence><sentence id="151">In 1941, the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in three days.</sentence><sentence id="152">You will see documentation shows it.</sentence><sentence id="153">I was 13 years old--a little girl--but I remember it.</sentence><sentence id="154">I remember it well.</sentence><sentence id="155">My <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, they marched through in one night.</sentence><sentence id="156"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that stands from the main <span class="DLF">road</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">In every war, the armies had to pass through it; because the main <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> had to pass this <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">So that's why we saw the war going through.</sentence><sentence id="159">But we were not affected by this military occupation.</sentence><sentence id="160">The military went through that night; no bombs fell, no people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="161">They went on farther to fight the war.</sentence><sentence id="162">But they left behind the (unclear word) the Gestapo, the Nazi party, the special unit that were called...I don't even know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="163">Einsatzgruppen, or whatever they were called at the time--to take care of the Jewish affairs.</sentence><sentence id="164">And their aim right away started like in any other <span class="NPIP">place</span> with different laws for Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="165">Jewish people are not allowed to have <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">Jewish children cannot go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">Jewish people are not allowed to go to buy food in the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> but at certain hours.</sentence><sentence id="168">By the time we got to that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to get the food, there was no food there.</sentence><sentence id="169">You know, they didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freezers</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerators</span> like here.</sentence><sentence id="170">Small <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">Every day the farmer brought the food.</sentence><sentence id="172">So right away, we suffered hunger already, too.</sentence><sentence id="173">The law came out [that] Jewish</sentence><sentence id="175">women were not allowed to be pregnant, they had to have abortions.</sentence><sentence id="176">No future for the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="177">Every Jew had to wear a Star of David in front and in back of the garment.</sentence><sentence id="178">Many people say to me, "Why did you have to wear it?"</sentence><sentence id="179">Two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="180">One, a symbol of shame.</sentence><sentence id="181">But the most important: why did they want us to wear it?</sentence><sentence id="182">An ID.</sentence><sentence id="183">They wanted to make sure they know exactly where the Jew is.</sentence><sentence id="184">The punishment for not wearing this... Specific[ally], we called it the "yellow letter."</sentence><sentence id="185">We didn't even call it a star.</sentence><sentence id="186">It was a Star of David; but the "patch of yellow," that's what we called it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">We didn't say Magen David, or yellow Magen David.</sentence><sentence id="188">The "yellow letter," we called it.</sentence><sentence id="189">It was a "yellow letter," we called it; it was a patch that was the ID.</sentence><sentence id="190">If you didn't wear it, the punishment was death.</sentence><sentence id="191">Now, you think about it.</sentence><sentence id="192">Children many times say, "Why did you have to put it on?</sentence><sentence id="193">You could go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>; they would think you are Christian."</sentence><sentence id="194">But unfortunately, not too many friends around us.</sentence><sentence id="195">The same people that were our neighbors deceived us, reported on us, showed where a Jew was.</sentence><sentence id="196">If you didn't put on, they would say, "This is a Jew."</sentence><sentence id="197">They killed you for not wearing that patch, that star.</sentence><sentence id="198">The next process was, they started to grab Jewish men off the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, out of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, out of the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">Allegedly, they have to clean the city of war damage.</sentence><sentence id="200">The Rabbis, the scholars--a thousand men were put into the <span class="BUILDING">city jails</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">We had two <span class="BUILDING">jails</span>; a white <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and a red <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">That's how it was called.</sentence><sentence id="203">The red Deturmen and the white Deturmen.</sentence><sentence id="204">Because one was painted white, the other was red bricks.</sentence><sentence id="205">They put them into those <span class="BUILDING">jails</span>, the most terrible Lithuanian sadists taking care of them.</sentence><sentence id="206">Who were they?The same policemen of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> that walked around.</sentence><sentence id="207">We didn't have even <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">They just walked around to make sure everything is in order.</sentence><sentence id="209">They joined the evil cause.</sentence><sentence id="210">They put on arm bands, they helped to get rid of the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="211">They had 1,000 men in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, with promises they are going to take them to labor.</sentence><sentence id="212">And we believed it.</sentence><sentence id="213">You don't think you don't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="214">You believe it.</sentence><sentence id="215">Well, some people ran and they tried to get people out of that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">But nobody succeeded.</sentence><sentence id="217">These thousand men were taken out to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> near</sentence><sentence id="219">our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kuzhi</span>, where they were made to dig their own <span class="DLF">graves</span>, they were made to get undressed naked, they were shot and they were covered with earth.</sentence><sentence id="220">How did we know exactly what happened there?</sentence><sentence id="221">The farmers in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">They came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and told us exactly.</sentence><sentence id="223">I, as a child, remember those farmers that used to bring milk to our <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>, to our <span class="BUILDING">dairy store</span>, doing like this (motioning), telling the earth shook over the so-called <span class="DLF">graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">Why did it shake?</sentence><sentence id="225">Many, many people fell into that <span class="DLF">hole</span> and were not even shot to death.</sentence><sentence id="226">They covered them with earth, and they suffocated.</sentence><sentence id="227">There are many incidents.</sentence><sentence id="228">I know a young man who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> who ran away from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of Aniksht.</sentence><sentence id="229">In this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the Germans and the Lithuanians were so drunk that they didn't cover the <span class="DLF">hole</span> that night.</sentence><sentence id="230">The only time when people tell you they run away from those <span class="DLF">holes</span> was if you were injured and they didn't cover the <span class="DLF">hole</span> that night -- they were too tired or didn't want to bother -- then they had a chance to escape.</sentence><sentence id="231">And also, many times, when I talk about escaping you have to understand to escape you need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to escape to.</sentence><sentence id="232">Everybody wanted to escape.</sentence><sentence id="233">But if your neighbor doesn't let you in, or if you try to run to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and while you are running somebody points a finger--"Here is a Jew"--and you are killed.</sentence><sentence id="234">So you wonder does it pay to escape, or maybe I should wait in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> for a week, a month.</sentence><sentence id="235">The war will end, and I will live.</sentence><sentence id="236">So after we heard what happened to this thousand men, we knew the Holocaust was happening to us.</sentence><sentence id="237">This is when in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> our own Jewish Community Council, marvelous leaders, marvelous men.</sentence><sentence id="238">And as I told you before, my mother was connected.</sentence><sentence id="239">Because she was on this committee of helping the poor and the widows, and so she knew firsthand from the leaders what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="240">They decided to go to the Christian clergy to beg them to help to save our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">Those Priests, Roman Catholic, they were marvelous men;

small <span class="REGION">area</span>--and that's where the Jews were supposed to relocate.</sentence><sentence id="270">Now, you couldn't take your bundles and move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">It was a special commission that came to every <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">The commission consisted of Germans and Lithuanians, because the Lithuanians showed them where is the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and the little secretaries.</sentence><sentence id="273">Now, I will share with you what happened in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>--firsthand information.</sentence><sentence id="274">My two brothers--one older five years than me, one seven years older than me--so one was 18, one was 20.</sentence><sentence id="275">I was 13.</sentence><sentence id="276">And my parents, my mother was at that point 43 and my father was maybe 45...yes, 45.</sentence><sentence id="277">And they came with commission, they looked around our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>; and they told my parents how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, how many pillows, how many clothing we can take to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and how many people.</sentence><sentence id="278">They issued four certificates.</sentence><sentence id="279">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was originally for people to work--not for children, not for sick, not for elderly.</sentence><sentence id="280">I was 13.</sentence><sentence id="281">They didn't need me.</sentence><sentence id="282">I remember it very well, how I felt when I saw I was going to be separated from my family at that point.</sentence><sentence id="283">My mother succeeded to bribe the Lithuanian Secretary.</sentence><sentence id="284">How did it happen?</sentence><sentence id="285">As a child, I had a ceramic cat where I used to save my money that I got for Chanukah, for my birthday--silver money.</sentence><sentence id="286">And my mother said to the secretary, quietly, "This is full of silver money.</sentence><sentence id="287">If you will ask for it and I will have to give it to you, please leave a blank certificate--the fifth one--on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>."</sentence><sentence id="288">And as they were walking out, this commission...the Secretary said, "I want this little cat.".</sentence><sentence id="289">My mother said, "That's my little girl's.</sentence><sentence id="290">She loves it."</sentence><sentence id="291">The German said "Give it to her."</sentence><sentence id="292">You understand, how she could bribe -- it's important to know this little fact -- and he walked out with a lot of money.</sentence><sentence id="293">But I remember my mother counting those certificates.</sentence><sentence id="294">Four were there with names filled in; a fifth blank certificate.</sentence><sentence id="295">My parents filled it in.</sentence><sentence id="296">Now, to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you just had to show the certificate.</sentence><sentence id="297">If you had the certificate, they let you in through the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">So about 5,000 people got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">We had 10,000 Jewish people in the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">The people that did not get this yellow certificate, I believe it's about 3,500.</sentence><sentence id="302">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, the elderly, the sick, the children from many families, and many, many people that came to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> last and there was no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>--they were put into the <span class="BUILDING">city synagogues</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">shulen</span>, as we called it, within the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">With hunger, no water; they were begging for food, they were begging for them to be saved.</sentence><sentence id="304">People were trying -- our Jewish Community Council, who were wonderful people, they tried so hard to save.</sentence><sentence id="305">They were saying already, "Okay, take them to this little city of Jagga.".</sentence><sentence id="306">They thought at least they will live; because we had already the 1,000 men experience.</sentence><sentence id="307">These people were killed just like the thousand men in another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, 3,500 of them.</sentence><sentence id="308">So by the time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, I don't know exactly whether it was August or September, I don't remember; but I know [by the] High Holidays, we were already--my family--in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">Half of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">population</span> was killed.</sentence><sentence id="310">So, that's how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">You know, feel free to interject or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="312">Now, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>... I will tell you how it was when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">All the working people went to work in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="314">Girls like me--at the age of 13, you see, I had a certificate to go in.</sentence><sentence id="315">But I wasn't on the master list, you understand?</sentence><sentence id="316">The same way, I was smuggled in.</sentence><sentence id="317">People succeeded to smuggle in some sick, some elderly, some children even younger than me.</sentence><sentence id="318">But you were not on the master list, master list or whatever, you didn't get food.</sentence><sentence id="319">You didn't get the rations.</sentence><sentence id="320">So your family shared with you.</sentence><sentence id="321">Let's say we got X amount of bread, or... don't remember how much it was at that time.</sentence><sentence id="322">Five people ate of the ration of four; and some people, four people ate of the ration of two.</sentence><sentence id="323">So this is... People have to understand that even as little as the ration was, if you were lucky enough to have your child or your elderly with you at that point, they didn't get food.</sentence><sentence id="324">Your ration of food became smaller.</sentence><sentence id="325">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, girls like me had to take care of little children.</sentence><sentence id="326">Many families right away tried to make some little hiding place, whether it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or in a <span class="DLF">wall</span>; because we saw that things look bad.</sentence><sentence id="327">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, selection upon selection, they came for no reason whatever to take people because they heard the rumor there are</sentence><sentence id="329">0 children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there are sick in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">How did they get in?</sentence><sentence id="331">We don't want to feed them.</sentence><sentence id="332">So they came to take them away.</sentence><sentence id="333">I lived through two years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like this.</sentence><sentence id="334">I don't know how I survived.</sentence><sentence id="335">How I have hidden.</sentence><sentence id="336">One time I remember -- the Jewish police in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were wonderful, they ran through and warned us that the SS is coming to take people so quickly hide, do whatever.</sentence><sentence id="337">So I was supposed to get out my <span class="DLF">door</span> and go into the little <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where you keep wood, that's where my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="338">As I was pulling the <span class="DLF">door</span> to open up I felt pressure on the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I remember not breathing but I could hear my heart pound and the German opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, the SS man, and he looked in and he said to his friend or whatever, his associate, "This <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is empty."</sentence><sentence id="339">And he closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind him.</sentence><sentence id="340">I tell you many incidents like this that I was saved at that time, really by the grace of God.</sentence><sentence id="341">Two years like this.</sentence><sentence id="342">When I was 15, I was allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">Now, there were many ways of people being put on a list.</sentence><sentence id="344">Let's say they took a selection of people, they took -- sometime they didn't even know how many they took -- they took 120, and the list was 100.</sentence><sentence id="345">20 people, kids that got a little older or the sick that got a little healthier could go out to work instead.</sentence><sentence id="346">So this is when I was 15, I went out to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> instead.</sentence><sentence id="347">So this is when I was 15, I went out to work.</sentence><sentence id="348">At that time, in 1943, they did not need two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">We were living already spacey so many people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="350">They combined both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> together, just the one on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trakai</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaukazas ghetto</span> was closed completely.</sentence><sentence id="352">We were transferred to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">A little bit people, there were too many of them, they took out some men and women.</sentence><sentence id="354">And we thought they were going to kill them.</sentence><sentence id="355">But no, they took them to a small <span class="NPIP">place</span>--I really don't remember the name--to work, to make turf.</sentence><sentence id="356">I don't know what turf is.</sentence><sentence id="357">It is a material that comes from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span>, and you press it for burn purposes, for heating purposes.</sentence><sentence id="358">I don't really know what you call that composite of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> and weeds.</sentence><sentence id="359">We used it a lot for heating purposes.</sentence><sentence id="360">So they took them there.</sentence><sentence id="361">We came in 1943 into the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">We were nine people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>: two uncles and aunts and our family [of] five.</sentence><sentence id="363">We</sentence><sentence id="365">1 were still together, that many of the family.</sentence><sentence id="366">And I recall that time, many times to my friends, I would say, "I remember it as a better time."</sentence><sentence id="367">And they say, "Why was it a better time?"</sentence><sentence id="368">And I said, "I still was surrounded with my family, which was pretty lot.</sentence><sentence id="369">Many uncles, many aunts, many cousins, grandparents, were dead at that time--that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around our <span class="REGION">area</span>, and in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">But my immediate family was still there."</sentence><sentence id="371">I tell you, really, I'm sitting here and trying to think of certain things to share with you.</sentence><sentence id="372">I think I forgot to tell you like in 1942 we had a hanging in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">A man was hung because he was caught at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> with some bread and a few eggs.</sentence><sentence id="374">Somebody said he had a few cigarettes on him, somebody said he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="375">But documented incident, because as you went out to work all through the year there were kind Lithuanian people, too.</sentence><sentence id="376">I really wants to share that and admire these people that wanted to give you a little bread for you to eat and wanted to give a little type of other food also to take back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for your family.</sentence><sentence id="377">But it's worthwhile talking about it because as you come back from work they frisked you bodily to make sure you are not smuggling in ammunition or food.</sentence><sentence id="378">Many guards were bribed.</sentence><sentence id="379">Many, many guards, you know especially Lithuanian guards, you would bribe them with a fur coat or whatever so if nobody was around they looked the other way and let you bring in that food, so we had a little more food to eat.</sentence><sentence id="380">But if let's say German Commission or another guard came that wasn't bribed, they came quickly and they grabbed the people, they beat them terrible.</sentence><sentence id="381">But that one incident this man's name was Mussevitsky, Batsalom Mussevitsky, he was a young man, he had a wife and a child in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">He was caught with that few eggs or half a loaf of bread but very little, maybe he had a few cigarettes, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="383">He was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">The Jewish Community Council was called and they were told they are holding a big criminal, the Jews have to learn a lesson, no food is in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">The following Sunday a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallow</span> was to be built in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">What was a gallow in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence><sentence id="387">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, some stick hammered to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> going this way like an L, upside-down L, a cord</sentence><sentence id="389">2 hanging there.</sentence><sentence id="390">Two men sitting there, they were supposed to be the henchmen, Jewish men.</sentence><sentence id="391">How they were picked, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="392">They ordered that we have to provide these henchmen.</sentence><sentence id="393">We all had to gather in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I remember very well a dozen SS men with guns outstretched like this went in with this one criminal that wanted to bring a little food for his child, you know.</sentence><sentence id="394">People say why didn't he run away, many times people say why didn't he run away.</sentence><sentence id="395">I said three hijackers hijack a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with hundreds of people, three guns against hundreds of people and they are in control.</sentence><sentence id="396">Imagine dozens of guns in control of one prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="397">Well, this man was marched in like this.</sentence><sentence id="398">He walked over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="399">He said to the two men "Thou shalt not kill," you know in Yiddish, "I will do it myself."</sentence><sentence id="400">He hopped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, they did not even have a chance like you know in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> they tie their hands back or they put a cover on their face.</sentence><sentence id="401">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="402">He hopped, he put a string of his own, the loop you know over his, the noose, whatever it's called, over his neck, and to the assassin, the Gestapo, he said you are not going to win a war by killing me" and somebody pushed or he pushed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> from under his feet and I remember his body dangling like this.</sentence><sentence id="403">I remember it so.</sentence><sentence id="404">Linda, it was terrible times.</sentence><sentence id="405">You know, I always try to control myself, not to be too emotional because otherwise if I get too emotional, I cannot bring the message.</sentence><sentence id="406">You know, you know, this what people have to think about.</sentence><sentence id="407">I say over, I say this man resisted the Germans, I always say there is a spiritual resistance.</sentence><sentence id="408">If you didn't fight back, if you didn't punch it or whatever, I say we live the extra day we resisted them.</sentence><sentence id="409">They wanted us dead.</sentence><sentence id="410">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> there was sign, "Yiden"--Jews--"Don't despair.</sentence><sentence id="411">Live an extra day.</sentence><sentence id="412">We will overcome it."</sentence><sentence id="413">The hope we gave each other all through, that's all I remember as a child saying (unclear phrase), in spite of the enemy, we will overcome it, we will live, we will be free.</sentence><sentence id="414">So you can imagine this punishment.</sentence><sentence id="415">Now go back to 1943 where I was before.</sentence><sentence id="416">When we got into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when they condensed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, we got a little more food.</sentence><sentence id="417">Things looked kind of better.</sentence><sentence id="418">Everybody thought, said gee, they start to treat us a little better.</sentence><sentence id="419">I was</sentence><sentence id="421">3 working at that time in the <span class="BUILDING">war hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="422">My job was to put wood into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> so the German soldiers would keep warm.</sentence><sentence id="423">You know we had a job, we had to do our job.</sentence><sentence id="424">That morning when I came to my commander to go to work -- it was exactly November 5, 1942, when I went with my group to go out to work -- we saw outside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ghetto trucks</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> covered with canvas, we were told we cannot go to work.</sentence><sentence id="425">I remember running back to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="426">My mother put two dresses on me one dress on top of another.</sentence><sentence id="427">You see people said maybe they don't let you take along a bundle.</sentence><sentence id="428">To be safe, a little bread in the pocket, a coin in the pocket, we were prepared to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="429">A half hour or whatever, I don't remember exactly, maybe 20 minutes, it was a short time, the Jewish police were running through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> saying a mistake was made in the order, all the working people should leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="431">People did not know what's better.</sentence><sentence id="432">Some people said it's better to hide in that Malina, in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malina</span> was called the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> during those times, a Malina -- some people said it's better to go to work.</sentence><sentence id="433">The Jewish police ran through and said whoever can go out to work -- we had marvelous people that were Jewish police in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">You won't hear not one had word about the leadership and the Jewish police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> after a certain point because after a certain point them to cover other people that the Germans appointed, they brought them from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, it was different.</sentence><sentence id="435">But as long as we had our own people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> it was good.</sentence><sentence id="436">So they said it's better to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="437">I remember leaving that day for work but all day long we wondered.</sentence><sentence id="438">What were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> doing near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">At one point in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we worked with a german, he was from a building commander that was called Ortek (ph) and he was a civilian and he was pretty nice man, he gave us sometime a little bread but he had nothing to do with the security or taking care of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="440">His job was building whatever.</sentence><sentence id="441">So we asked this man to go near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and see what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="442">When he came back he said nothing happened but we saw he was pale, we saw he was bothered.</sentence><sentence id="443">But he said nothing, there was nothing there.</sentence><sentence id="444">That evening when we were</sentence><sentence id="446">4 coming back from work, blocks and blocks away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, Linda, we heard cries, such cries I hope nobody will hear.</sentence><sentence id="447">What happened in the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> on November 5, 1943, SS and Gestapo with the help of Ukranians, Ukranians that left the Russians and joined the evil cause so many of them just came -- so many of them just came and joined to kill Jewish people, it was terrible time -- they went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they found every <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, they went in, they broke every dish, every pillow, made every single person come to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> near that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you gathered for work, all the children, all the elderly, all the sick, all the babies that were born illegally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">You see, they told us we were not allowed to be pregnant but women got pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="449">They stayed in their little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="450">If they were caught in the selection, then they were caught, but if they were not caught they had their baby in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">But on that day not one child was spared.</sentence><sentence id="452">At the <span class="DLF">gate</span> a selection to the right and to the left, a thousand children.</sentence><sentence id="453">Five hundred elderly and sick and a few hundred healthy and strong, including two men from our Jewish Community Council because these two men said to them "Where are you taking these children?"</sentence><sentence id="454">They said "To a better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, you are welcome to come and check it out" and they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="455">We did not know then where they were taken to.</sentence><sentence id="456">We honestly believed that they were taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they have children.</sentence><sentence id="457">They said these children need supervision, you all go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, we will take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="458">After the war we found out they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> where they were gassed and cremated, they did not even keep them there one day.</sentence><sentence id="459">The Rabbis told me that I have to keep Yarzeit on that day that my father was taken.</sentence><sentence id="460">My father was taken with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">My father was 47 years old.</sentence><sentence id="462">He was among the nice Healthy, strong, tall people.</sentence><sentence id="463">Can you imagine how I feel even sharing with you?</sentence><sentence id="464">You know, Linda, I am talking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">I am giving you just my own but by now, 1989, we know what happened all over Europe.</sentence><sentence id="466">The life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after the children selection was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="467">No laughter, no crying.</sentence><sentence id="468">My mother used to say to me, "Nessele, don't</sentence><sentence id="470">5 go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> after you come from <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="471">The neighbor lost a child one year younger than you.</sentence><sentence id="472">She will hurt."</sentence><sentence id="473">Can you imagine -- you know European people had a lot of children -- can you imagine in one day from a mother six children, eight children, you came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="474">We were a lucky family, just my father was taken.</sentence><sentence id="475">Can you me saying a lucky family after they killed my father but we were a lucky family because on that day every family lost dear ones.</sentence><sentence id="476">Not just one, two, four, six, eight people of a family went on that terrible day.</sentence><sentence id="477">So the life was terrible after that, it was just terrible.</sentence><sentence id="478">They were trying -- I don't remember exactly details -- they were trying, I mean the Germans, the SS, the Gestapo, make some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> where they thought the workers could work separately.</sentence><sentence id="479">They thought they would get rid of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> completely.</sentence><sentence id="480">Then they thought they still need some people that should stay.</sentence><sentence id="481">There was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that was making the shoes, a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that was making some brushes.</sentence><sentence id="482">So they left some people in those <span class="BUILDING">workshops</span> for a little bit longer but us in June of 1944, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> for deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="483">We had to walk about 10 kilometers to this specific <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> because in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> bombs fell already.</sentence><sentence id="484">The last few days that we were in the ghetto Russian bombs fell in our city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siaulai</span>.</sentence><sentence id="485">We were so glad to see the bombs but quite a few fell in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> too and quite a few people died and at that point we said already maybe they are luckier that they died of a Russian bomb than what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="486">So we were taken to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> by foot, we had to walk.</sentence><sentence id="487">I remember that walk very well because my mother at that time had an injury in her leg and she walked on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and she had injured her knees and she couldn't walk to well and they said whoever cannot walk, whoever is sick or weak should stay and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> will bring them to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, and my mother, like a <span class="DLF">pool</span>, stood in that group saying -- they couldn't see the injury, it was so tight, it was covered -- she said "I cannot walk, I would like to go on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>" and a German said to her, "What do you think, run, you are still young, go to work," you know he saved her life because we never saw the rest of the people that were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">We
