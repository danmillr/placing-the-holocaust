<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: We felt very comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="57">We were not one of the richest, but we made a living.</sentence><sentence id="58">And my father was respected as a very good mechanic.</sentence><sentence id="59">People came to him with repairs and bought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> from us.</sentence><sentence id="60">And my mother was, so to say, the bookkeeper and taking care of the things.</sentence><sentence id="61">And she had the very good handwriting.</sentence><sentence id="62">At that time we hadn't <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span>, and people came from far and wide and had her write letters.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Were you involved in cultural activities or community activities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: To a certain extent, with the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and I had religious lessons there in the afternoon, because we did not have a <span class="BUILDING">day school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">So I went in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="75">And besides this, I was very friendly with some people, some youngsters who lived a little further out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hammerlichen</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="76">And those Jewish people whom I saw there, it was a two hours walk, but I went on the weekends several times.</sentence><sentence id="77">They were mostly from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and they had settled there.</sentence><sentence id="78">There was a difference in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> between what they call the ost stuent (ph) and the west stuent (ph).</sentence><sentence id="79">And I felt very comfortable with the ost stuent (ph), too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: Did -- were you involved in any political organizations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="90">A Not really, but I remember that sometime before Hitler came to power, 1932, I remember, I was associated of going with the Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="91">And in the Zionist organization, it was more leftist.</sentence><sentence id="92">And I did not like this, because they are very close to Communism, and I did not like it, and I left.</sentence><sentence id="93">And some 30 or 40 other youngsters left with me, and we joined a different organization.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: This was also a political organization?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="101">It was not really a political organization.</sentence><sentence id="102">It was more or less a religious organization, a of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: What did you do in that <span class="BUILDING">organization</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: We tried to teach people something about Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="109">And we also tried them how to behave in the Nazi -- during the -- in the Nazi time.</sentence><sentence id="110">And, but we were not political in that sense.</sentence><sentence id="111">We did not want to join any political movement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Judaism was quite important to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="119">It was very important to me, because despite the fact that my father was not very religious and my mother came from a religious family.</sentence><sentence id="120">But I felt more religious.</sentence><sentence id="121">And especially through teachers whom I had there in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish religious school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: And at this time, prior to 1933, there were never any obstacles to you expressing your Judaism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: No, not to me.</sentence><sentence id="129">However, to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="130">And I remember that already in 1928 when we went for a trip to the <span class="DLF">park</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, the Nazis were very influential, and they just had received 107 people, I think, 107 members in the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">And they came into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where we were riding, into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> where we were riding, and my mother was very much afraid that Jewish life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would become different, which it did.</sentence><sentence id="132">And I saw many times that -- that the Nazis had in mind to exterminate all the Jews, especially in the non<span class="BUILDING">-Jewish school</span> where I went, they sometimes ridiculed me and they said to me, "Go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span>, go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">You don't belong here."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: These were other students?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="142">A Students, yeah, from the non-Jewish school.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: And this was all prior to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="146">A: This was even prior to Hitler.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: So you were -- you were fairly aware of Naziism before Hitler came to power, then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="151">But we never thought that he would get power, because the largest party in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were the social democrats.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: So how did all of this start escalating when Hitler came to power?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: When Hitler came to power in January 1933, we listened to the radio, and we thought that it would only last a little while.</sentence><sentence id="157">Because we had non-Jewish friends living near us, and they told us, "Don't worry, it will only last a little while, and it cannot go on this way.</sentence><sentence id="158">It will stop."</sentence><sentence id="159">However, by that time, many youngsters and many other people had joined the party.</sentence><sentence id="160">Some of them joined the party even though they were not 100 percent convinced about Hitler and had no -- much belief in him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Why did they join the party?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: They knew things would change.</sentence><sentence id="169">And there were different reasons, because of the political speeches which Hitler made, because of blaming the Jews for having mishandled and brought <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into such a mishap, like the S.I. and all kinds of things, you see.</sentence><sentence id="170">And they blamed the Jews on it, because that was one thing in order to get the -- to unite the party against Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: So did you sense that the people in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> started to believe this and believe in all of this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: There were some people who did not believe it.</sentence><sentence id="177">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, even more than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was more Communistic at that time than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> was still, when they had the elections in 1933, 64 percent social democrat.</sentence><sentence id="180">And many times, I saw Nazis coming to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> who told me, "I'm really a Communist.</sentence><sentence id="181">But I have to cover it up, because if they ever found out, they would send me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>," because they already had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in 1933.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: So you didn't feel that it was going to be this serious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: We felt -- we felt that every day had got more serious.</sentence><sentence id="191">Because in the very beginning, when they had the seven states -- seven days of celebration, when Hitler came to power, afterwards when they had the Reister (ph) fire, the burning of the ragster (ph) at the end of February.</sentence><sentence id="192">And then finally, when on April Ist, they had the first progrune, (ph) the day of solidarity, they called it, when -- which happened to be on the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="193">And Jews were not allowed to go out.</sentence><sentence id="194">Non-Jews could go out.</sentence><sentence id="195">So we really felt it was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="196">Also, they forbade right away Schreichter (ph), that means slaughtering according to Jewish custom.</sentence><sentence id="197">So we felt it was getting bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Now, how did the attitudes of your friends, your teachers, start changing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: In the beginning, they still came to our <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">But as time went on, when Hitler made a law that all the parties were prohibited, except the Nazi national party, national socialist.</sentence><sentence id="210">And anyone who joins Jews, who talks to Jews, then they slowly kept away from Jews, from us.</sentence><sentence id="211">And it happened before, you see, that they tried to do something against it that we should not have business anymore, and take away the business from us.</sentence><sentence id="212">It happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Can you -- do you have specific memories of situations with good friends of yours who were not Jewish, or your teachers, how they started changing toward you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: There were many changes.</sentence><sentence id="221">Let's talk about, if I may, so talk about our neighbor.</sentence><sentence id="222">We had a neighbor who had also -- who had been placed there by the Nazis and had also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and <span class="BUILDING">repair shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">And he didn't know very much about the business.</sentence><sentence id="224">He came to my father, and my father taught him and gave him business and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="225">One day, the Nazis told him to build a high <span class="DLF">wall</span> near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so high that we could not look out anymore, completely close our <span class="DLF">windows</span>, just in order to take away business from us, even though he came to us and he wanted to -- he needed it, because he didn't know too much about the mechanics.</sentence><sentence id="226">Regarding the youngsters, the children, more or less, they were forced to join the Hitler Youth.</sentence><sentence id="227">And as soon as they joined the Hitler Youth, they were not allowed to have any more contact with Jewish people, with me and others.</sentence><sentence id="228">But the teachers, if that's what you are asking me, were different.</sentence><sentence id="229">The teachers were a different generation, the generation before.</sentence><sentence id="230">And they felt that it was not right to do this.</sentence><sentence id="231">And quietly taking me apart, they told me about it.</sentence><sentence id="232">But not publicly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: So for a while, you still were in the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span>, the teachers were kind to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Things didn't change too much initially?</sentence><sentence id="250">A No.</sentence><sentence id="251">In fact the teacher told me at that time in 1934, they made a law that Jewish children, especially orthodox Jewish children, were no longer allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="252">They used to do this.</sentence><sentence id="253">And when they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Sabbath, they would not write, would not take baggage along.</sentence><sentence id="254">Now they said, "If you come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you have to do everything."</sentence><sentence id="255">So I went to my teacher and I said to him, "I don't want to come any more on Sabbath."</sentence><sentence id="256">He said to me, "Why don't you want to come anymore?"</sentence><sentence id="257">So I said to him, "You know, when Hitler came to power, Hitler wanted Germans to know about their background as Germans, to give them a certain sense of identity, according to what he thinks is the identity.</sentence><sentence id="258">So I want to go a little bit back to my own identity to being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="259">I want to be more Jewish now.</sentence><sentence id="260">You want to be more Nazi; I want to be more Jewish."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: This was brave in 1934.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="276">And then the teacher told me, "What I will do to you is, whatever I teach on the Sabbath, I will tell the students to give you the notes.</sentence><sentence id="277">And besides this, on Sabbath, I will teach them Mein Kampf, Hitler's book, so you won't be there."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Why do you think the teachers -- was this a risk for the teachers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: It was a certain risk.</sentence><sentence id="284">But they did not do it publicly.</sentence><sentence id="285">They put on the Nazi emblem, which was like a life saver, double ring, with a swastika in it.</sentence><sentence id="286">And the teacher told me I had to put this on.</sentence><sentence id="287">This is my life saver. "</sentence><sentence id="288">They are taking away my job," and many jobs from teachers were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="289">The principal of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I went, non-Jewish, was retired, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="290">The teachers at that time were about between 50 and 60 years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of how all this started changing.</sentence><sentence id="300">And my guess is that every year it certainly got worse in terms of your ability to spend time with your Gentile friends, or your teachers" relationships with you.</sentence><sentence id="301">How did life start changing?</sentence><sentence id="302">Do you remember any specific people or instances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="308">We were good friends with people, neighbors.</sentence><sentence id="309">And there were some young people.</sentence><sentence id="310">We came together; we played together.</sentence><sentence id="311">There was a <span class="DLF">yard</span>, what they call a <span class="DLF">playground</span> like this, not far from us.</sentence><sentence id="312">And we played together with them.</sentence><sentence id="313">And everything was fine.</sentence><sentence id="314">I even went on bicycle tours with some of these people and everything was fine.</sentence><sentence id="315">I even have a picture at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I am in this picture with the neighbors, the non-Jewish people who were with us.</sentence><sentence id="316">They were all very nice to us.</sentence><sentence id="317">However, it changed because everyone was forced -- two things.</sentence><sentence id="318">They were forced number one to join the Hitler Youths.</sentence><sentence id="319">And number two, they were forced to tell the Hitler Youths of what their parents thought about the Nazis at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">And so slowly it infiltrated to the parents and to others, you see.</sentence><sentence id="321">And they felt it was not safe anymore to talk to Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: And they stopped talking to you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: Slowly, they stopped talking to us.</sentence><sentence id="339">Then later on, they started to avoid us by walking on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, or by just not talking to us.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Were they ever abusive or violent?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: No, not in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="343">But you could not complain, because there were still people there who were of the old type.</sentence><sentence id="344">And I remember that one day I went to the -- a fair, which they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> nor far from us, and they showed a puppet show.</sentence><sentence id="345">And in the puppet show, they showed how the one person went against the Jews, boop, boop, boop.</sentence><sentence id="346">So I asked a policeman there, which actually was stupid of me.</sentence><sentence id="347">But I asked the policeman, "Why do you show such shows?"</sentence><sentence id="348">You see, "Why do they show such shows here," you see. "</sentence><sentence id="349">The Jews are also people."</sentence><sentence id="350">He didn't answer, because the answer was simply, "Because this regime is against the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="351">That's why we have to infiltrate the public, and we have to make them aware that Jews are different.</sentence><sentence id="352">And they have to be done away with."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: As time went on, were you ever hurt or abused in any way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Not directly.</sentence><sentence id="367">But I remember that one day, when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span>, the boys came and they took away my hat.</sentence><sentence id="368">And they threw it up, and they tried to hurt and beat me.</sentence><sentence id="369">And, but I was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="370">Somehow I got this hat back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="376">Q: Were you ever afraid?</sentence><sentence id="377">Did your parents start getting fairly worried about the situation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: My mother was very much afraid of this situation.</sentence><sentence id="381">And my father, too.</sentence><sentence id="382">But, so we started quite early, 1934, "35, or even before that, to find relatives or people all over in the world, wherever we thought we had some people.</sentence><sentence id="383">Because some of my mother's relatives had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">Some had gone to <span class="REGION">South America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">And my father, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was out of the question.</sentence><sentence id="386">To find out if they would be able to help us getting out, because we want to get out.</sentence><sentence id="387">And the only way, especially after the Nuremberg laws, 1935, and then 1936, they made it like imperative to move out.</sentence><sentence id="388">We couldn't stay there anymore, because the business got worse.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: Was your father's <span class="BUILDING">business</span> closed down?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Eventually, you see.</sentence><sentence id="401">They made very little -- they earned very little in that <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">And they had something like what's called a community project whereby they collected food and so on.</sentence><sentence id="403">And we even had to use some of this food in order to live, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: Now, you graduated from <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: Yeah, even later.</sentence><sentence id="411">I graduated from some kind of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1936.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="412">Q: And then you went -- then you went onto --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="413">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="414">Then 1936 when I graduated from there, through the help of a teacher, a Jewish teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.1259073567769" long="8.65818761080501">Frankfurt am Main</span>.</sentence><sentence id="415">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.1259073567769" long="8.65818761080501">Frankfurt am Main</span> for one year.</sentence><sentence id="416">We considered this, like, instead of military service, Jewish service, you see, because many people there prepared what they called Hashra (ph), which means preparation for moving out to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">At that time it was very difficult even to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because it was under British dominion, and the British didn't want anyone there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="423">Q: So you went to -- you went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="428">And things -- were things more difficult, less difficult there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="431">A In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, contrary to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, we lived in a Jewish -- more of a Jewish environment.</sentence><sentence id="432">And at that time, we did not feel so much about what the outside world did.</sentence><sentence id="433">But we read, of course, the papers.</sentence><sentence id="434">But from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> after one year, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span>, which was a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">And this <span class="BUILDING">teacher's seminary</span> was not far from the <span class="DLF">railroads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="436">And there, I saw every day <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span>, dozens of them, covered up with tarpaulin, with machine guns, moving to the front, to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, to all kinds of <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: What did you make of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: So we thought -- of course, this was done secretly.</sentence><sentence id="446">But we knew or we thought that this was a preparation for war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="449">Q: Of course, now, you were thinking about war.</sentence><sentence id="450">You weren't necessarily thinking about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="453">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="454">You see, at that time we knew there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">Because already in 1933, "34, "33, when they had the Sachsenhausenbergerhomme (ph), we heard from friends of ours, Jewish friends, that they had received urns of ashes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">And it said, "This person was killed while trying to flee," or, "This person committed suicide," or, "This person had been ill."</sentence><sentence id="457">And so we knew something was going on there, but we didn't really know what was going on there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="463">Q: Do you -- do you have memories of any of the book burnings or any of some of the more violent outbursts?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="465">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="466">I remember the book burning was early in May 1933.</sentence><sentence id="467">And just because of curiosity, I wanted to go and see it.</sentence><sentence id="468">So I went out, it was in the evening, about 9:00, 10:00 o'clock, I went out to this big <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they had all the books and they were burning the books.</sentence><sentence id="469">And I was standing from afar.</sentence><sentence id="470">And I saw all of the -- thrust all of the books into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span>, into this fire and burned them.</sentence><sentence id="471">So I saw the book burning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="479">Q: This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="481">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="483">Q: What did you make of it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="485">A: I only thought, "They don't know what they are doing."</sentence><sentence id="486">Because these were some of the most intelligent people, you see, that burned the books.</sentence><sentence id="487">They probably don't know anything about these books, you see, just to burn it.</sentence><sentence id="488">I say, by burning books, you cannot really do much, because other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> have the book.</sentence><sentence id="489">And so the books wouldn't get lost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: Was it frightening at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="498">Europe was frightening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="501">Q: Do you have memories of <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> closing down, or any other violent outbursts prior to Kristallnacht?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: Prior to Kristallnacht, we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> what we called great big <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="504">And there were two or three <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> in the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">And they had actually built <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> which were new at that time, you see, were the newest kind.</sentence><sentence id="506">There was one <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> by a Jewish person who had for the first time this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="507">They didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="508">And this went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="509">And people went there a lot, just because of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span>, I think, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish department store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="510">And they were closed and taken over by non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="511">Or if they were not taken over directly by non-Jews, a non-Jew was made the chief manager of that <span class="BUILDING">department store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="512">I think it was Bamberger's department store, if I remember, and certain others.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: Did -- I mean, did this make it more difficult to start getting things to have a normal life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="525">Not just the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, but in general?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="526">A: We tried to live a normal life as much as was possible.</sentence><sentence id="527">And we tried to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as soon as possible and to find some way of living.</sentence><sentence id="528">You could not change, because since we had this business, and my father knew this business, and we were helping him in this business, that was a way, you see, we could make a living.</sentence><sentence id="529">You couldn't just change and do a different job.</sentence><sentence id="530">Because eventually he was thrown out of the , which means the trade union, and all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="531">And they even tried to -- to find something out against him, like they came in and they bought certain things.</sentence><sentence id="532">And then they said, "These things were stolen."</sentence><sentence id="533">And they want to accuse him of having stolen these things.</sentence><sentence id="534">They came in and buying things at a different price, and just to say, "He oversells, he overprices," and things of this sort.</sentence><sentence id="535">But thank God, he was -- they couldn't put anything on him, you see.</sentence><sentence id="536">But they tried.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: How did you all combat this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="551">A: It was very hard, very hard.</sentence><sentence id="552">I was not then so much involved anymore in the business, because I was living away, <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="553">And I was more in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish environment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">But my mother felt very bad about it.</sentence><sentence id="555">And my father, too.</sentence><sentence id="556">And they tried to handle the situation as best as could be.</sentence><sentence id="557">And with the little they had, they continued.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="565">Q: Tell me a little bit about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: Actually, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> did not start at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>.</sentence><sentence id="568">It started, I think, on the 28th of October, when a number of students from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where I had been at that time were of Polish descent, and they were sent away.</sentence><sentence id="569">And that's where the story of Herschel Grynszpan comes in.</sentence><sentence id="570">They were sent away.</sentence><sentence id="571">First they were sent to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="572">And we went there and we threw packages of food in there, and we tried to help them.</sentence><sentence id="573">And we tried to tell them so-and-so.</sentence><sentence id="574">Then when the Germans and the Poles concluded their contract, I mean, the negotiations, then suddenly it stopped.</sentence><sentence id="575">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which had been sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was like this: A part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they could go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="576">The part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, they could stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">Even the Polish were just as much anti-Semitic as the Germans, maybe more.</sentence><sentence id="578">And the people in the middle were in No Man's Land.</sentence><sentence id="579">And that's where Herschel Grynszpan came.</sentence><sentence id="580">But two weeks later on November 9th, the 10th, was the Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="581">No one thought of this.</sentence><sentence id="582">What happened is this: On the day before Kristallnacht, we were studying in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a test which should have been the next day.</sentence><sentence id="583">And I had already been a student and a teacher in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time, because I spoke a little bit of Spanish, so I gave a little bit Spanish classes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> from October to November.</sentence><sentence id="584">And then in the night it happened, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> early on that evening, because I wanted to study some more.</sentence><sentence id="585">And besides this, I wanted to have a good night's sleep for the test the next day.</sentence><sentence id="586">You want to hear more about that?</sentence><sentence id="587">So we went to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="588">Then in the middle of the night, about 2:30 or 3:30, I don't remember anymore the time.</sentence><sentence id="589">I think it was -- it was the night that I remember, the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="590">We heard noise coming in, into the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> where I stayed, which was in this little side <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="591">And I woke up my colleagues, and I said to them, "What shall we do?</sentence><sentence id="592">There is noise.</sentence><sentence id="593">Shall we go and find out where the noise comes from?"</sentence><sentence id="594">So we waited, and we heard -- the noise got louder.</sentence><sentence id="595">So I said to them, "Let's make sure we are safe."</sentence><sentence id="596">So the <span class="DLF">window</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on the top, barricaded so we couldn't even go through that <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="597">Outside, there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">And outside the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="599">So I said to them, "The best thing is we get dressed now.</sentence><sentence id="600">And if anything should happen, we are ready to encounter whatever there is."</sentence><sentence id="601">And I said, "Let's get our bags ready, if anything should happen."</sentence><sentence id="602">And then I said, "Let's maybe hide under the -- under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, or in that corner."</sentence><sentence id="603">And then I decided, "No, we don't -- 0 shouldn't hide.</sentence><sentence id="604">We should just meet it head-on."</sentence><sentence id="605">So there was a <span class="DLF">door</span>, one <span class="DLF">door</span>, with a little lock.</sentence><sentence id="606">First I tried to lock it, but then I said, "It's no use.</sentence><sentence id="607">If they come, they come."</sentence><sentence id="608">And they did come.</sentence><sentence id="609">They made a lot of noise.</sentence><sentence id="610">They came in, and they saw our suitcases there.</sentence><sentence id="611">And they said, "Take these suitcases and throw them against the <span class="DLF">window</span>."</sentence><sentence id="612">They wouldn't fall outside the <span class="DLF">window</span> anyhow, because the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were barricaded.</sentence><sentence id="613">Then he said, and I said to them, "What shall we do?" "</sentence><sentence id="614">Stay here and wait until we give you orders.</sentence><sentence id="615">And you should know, we never even bent a hair of a Jew, and we won't do it this time.</sentence><sentence id="616">But eventually, you will all be exterminated," something like that.</sentence><sentence id="617">I don't know if they said the exact words.</sentence><sentence id="618">So we waited, then said, "What should we wait for?</sentence><sentence id="619">Let's go downstairs."</sentence><sentence id="620">That was on the second floor.</sentence><sentence id="621">We went through the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span>, and we saw in the big -- there was another <span class="BUILDING">dormitory place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="622">We were on a small side room with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lamps</span> hanging down.</sentence><sentence id="623">They just took their swords, or whatever they had, and cut off the electric lamps that were hanging down.</sentence><sentence id="624">They cut the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faucet</span> so that the water was just coming out.</sentence><sentence id="625">And they said to us, "Go downstairs."</sentence><sentence id="626">There was a non-Jewish janitor.</sentence><sentence id="627">And he said to us, "You better get dressed and get ready, because we don't know what's going to happen," because they didn't tell anyone else.</sentence><sentence id="628">Then the caretaker of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> thought it would be good idea to go to the police and tell them what happened.</sentence><sentence id="629">But that was a joke, because going to the police, they just kept him there.</sentence><sentence id="630">He never came back, and probably afterwards was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="631">Then the woman of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> downstairs said, "What I will do," it is 4:00 o'clock in the morning, 4:30, "I will make some coffee for you.</sentence><sentence id="632">I will give you something to eat."</sentence><sentence id="633">And she did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="701">Q: This was a non-Jewish woman?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: Yes, it was a non-Jewish woman.</sentence><sentence id="704">There was also Jewish woman there, both.</sentence><sentence id="705">Then we said, "Let's wait and see what's going to happen."</sentence><sentence id="706">The people who had come into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, 10, 20 people, left.</sentence><sentence id="707">And there was quiet.</sentence><sentence id="708">But the non-Jewish janitor said to us, "They will come back."</sentence><sentence id="709">And they did come back.</sentence><sentence id="710">About 6:00, 6:30, they came back.</sentence><sentence id="711">And they told --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: Excuse me, this is the same morning?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="723">A: This is the same morning.</sentence><sentence id="724">On November 10th, it was a Thursday morning, they came back.</sentence><sentence id="725">And the Nazis who were not dressed in Nazi uniform, because they wanted the people to believe it's the foixvut (ph), the anger of the people.</sentence><sentence id="726">And this does not come from the party, but comes from the plain civilian people.</sentence><sentence id="727">They were in civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="728">They told us, "Get a little bit together."</sentence><sentence id="729">We thought we should pack all of this. "</sentence><sentence id="730">No, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="731">You will come back."</sentence><sentence id="732">Of course, it wasn't true, you see.</sentence><sentence id="733">So we took a few things along, and they said, "All of you assemble in this <span class="NPIP">corner</span>."</sentence><sentence id="734">And so we assembled in that <span class="NPIP">corner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">And then about 7:30 or so, they said to us, "Now let's go and march."</sentence><sentence id="736">They marched about three or four, maybe even six in a <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">We were about -- I don't even remember how many people there were.</sentence><sentence id="738">But there were 50, 60 people or more.</sentence><sentence id="739">And we walked, it's a narrow <span class="DLF">street</span>, through this narrow <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">And we walked toward the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> they led us.</sentence><sentence id="741">And while we were going through the <span class="DLF">street</span>, the populace, the people were 1 standing at the side.</sentence><sentence id="742">I think they were all Nazis, because they spit at us, and they threw stones at us and all kinds of -- and they made noise and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="743">We went through the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we passed by the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">We saw the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> burning.</sentence><sentence id="745">And we went all the way, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where there used to be a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> of the Bavarian king.</sentence><sentence id="746">We passed by there, and they led us to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="747">And they were -- the Germans were very methodical.</sentence><sentence id="748">When you came in, they took a picture of you, on the right side, from the left side, from the front.</sentence><sentence id="749">And they took all your money, or all kind of things which you had in your pocket.</sentence><sentence id="750">And they made a complete record of it.</sentence><sentence id="751">They were very meticulous.</sentence><sentence id="752">They were very orderly in that sense.</sentence><sentence id="753">And they gave it to us, and they said, "Sign here."</sentence><sentence id="754">Okay, we signed.</sentence><sentence id="755">Then they led us into <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="756">And I was in <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cell</span> number 99, I think.</sentence><sentence id="757">And there were about 15 boys in that <span class="INT_SPACE">prison cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="758">They put us in there, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">water cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">And there was, like, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bowel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">And there were <span class="DLF">windows</span> on top, with iron bars.</sentence><sentence id="761">And there was -- I don't think anything else, maybe a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> or so.</sentence><sentence id="762">And in the <span class="DLF">door</span> was a little <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">And through this <span class="DLF">window</span> they gave us food about an hour later, like water with a few beans in it and things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="805">Q: How long were you in this <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: From that Thursday until the next Thursday, eight days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: It was fairly --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: And we always thought we would all be sent away.</sentence><sentence id="812">Because every morning and every evening, they took us all out.</sentence><sentence id="813">Once a day, they led us around the <span class="DLF">prison yard</span> to give us a prison walk for an hour.</sentence><sentence id="814">And then they led us all out, and they read a list of names to make sure everyone was still there.</sentence><sentence id="815">And every day, the number had come less.</sentence><sentence id="816">And we imagined, because no one told us, that they probably were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">And then came the last day of the seven days.</sentence><sentence id="818">They called us a list.</sentence><sentence id="819">They called us a list, and they read all the names.</sentence><sentence id="820">Then they read seven names, and I was among the seven whom they read.</sentence><sentence id="821">And they said to them, "Stay at the side."</sentence><sentence id="822">We stayed at the side.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: What were you thinking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="837">A: I didn't know what they would do with us.</sentence><sentence id="838">I think they would send us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="839">But what happened was, all the others were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">And these seven, I among them, was stateless.</sentence><sentence id="841">And they said to us, "You are stateless, and we are going to send you away," not telling us where.</sentence><sentence id="842">So I thought maybe they send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, because my father came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="843">And I said to myself, "It's better to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> than to stay here," even though I didn't know that at that time it was just as bad.</sentence><sentence id="844">And I already made up my mind to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="845">Within 24 hours I will be in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>."</sentence><sentence id="846">That was at noon-time then.</sentence><sentence id="847">Then they came back in the evening, and they called us again, the seven people.</sentence><sentence id="848">And they said, "Go downstairs and report to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">prison office</span>."</sentence><sentence id="849">I know now that all the others were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> because they wanted to empty the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of all the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="850">All people under 15 and over 60 were 2 sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">They only kept the people between 15 and 60, I think.</sentence><sentence id="852">So when we came downstairs, they told us, "You are free.</sentence><sentence id="853">Sign this."</sentence><sentence id="854">And they gave us back all the things which they had taken away from us.</sentence><sentence id="855">They were very meticulous.</sentence><sentence id="856">And they said, "Return within 24 hours to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home cities</span>, and report to the Gestapo."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: Now, how did this feel?</sentence><sentence id="878">I mean, it must have been a fairly strange feeling that you were so close to being sent away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="881">A: I didn't -- I felt -- I said, "Whatever is going to happen to us, we cannot do much about it.</sentence><sentence id="882">We can maybe pray a little bit," and that's what we did while we were together in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="883">But what can we do?</sentence><sentence id="884">We hope for the best, you see, and we know bad things -- bad things are going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="885">We hope that a miracle or something would happen, and things will change for us."</sentence><sentence id="886">Well, it was very bad, and nothing helped us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: Now, while you must have had a certain immediate relief at not being sent away, what were you thinking about the other people you had spent time with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="895">A: We felt very bad about the other people that were sent away.</sentence><sentence id="896">And we hoped that maybe they wouldn't have to stay there such a long time.</sentence><sentence id="897">At that time, they had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, but they did not do the killings in such large measures as afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="898">They killed a few people, as I mentioned before.</sentence><sentence id="899">They sent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urns</span> to those people about -- Jews and non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="900">I even know non-Jews whose urns they had sent away, back to them, to family.</sentence><sentence id="901">So we thought -- and beside this, when we came out, we knew that Greppels (ph) had called off -- Gurling (ph) had called off the sending away the Jews on the day afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="902">It didn't make much difference.</sentence><sentence id="903">I only felt, I only thought that maybe I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I would see what's going on there.</sentence><sentence id="904">But for eight days we didn't know what was going on in the world because we were completely separated from any news.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="915">Q: I'm going to ask you, do you want a glass of water?</sentence></p></dialogue>
