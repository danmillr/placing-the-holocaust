<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: When you say they tried to shield you, how did they shield you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: By not talking about any of their problems in front of us.</sentence><sentence id="99">It was always hush hush.</sentence><sentence id="100">And that's why I have so few memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: After Kristallnacht, what was next for you and your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: Well, we piled into this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my father, his brother and one of the cousins were terrified about being picked up and put into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">So for three or four nights they would sleep during the day and drive through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> at night in order not to be picked up.</sentence><sentence id="258">The only thing they did was stop for gas.</sentence><sentence id="259">They did this for -- well, Kristallnacht was on a Thursday, they did it Friday during the day, Friday night was Shabbat and they stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> shab -- and they were hiding, because the m -- there were very few men around of their age.</sentence><sentence id="260">And they started doing this again Sunday, and I think Monday and Tuesday.</sentence><sentence id="261">And then they tried to go across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, illegally.</sentence><sentence id="262">And of course they were caught and sent back.</sentence><sentence id="263">And tried -- a day or so later they tried again and they managed to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span>, but were picked up by Dutch police that were friendly to the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="264">And they informed the Nazis and they put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">They were imprisoned.</sentence><sentence id="266">And as I said earlier, my uncle and aunt had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> already.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="270">And with the assistance of highly prominent people in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, that had connections to the queen, etcetera, they were able to arrange that they were not being sent -- that they would not be sent back.</sentence><sentence id="271">So -- and they were put into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, which was kind of like restricted.</sentence><sentence id="272">They were not allowed out, but they were not in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">And they were there from November "38 to May 1939.</sentence><sentence id="274">We did not see my father in all that time, we had no contact with him.</sentence><sentence id="275">And my mother then handled -- my mother and my aunts handled all the emigration things because after Kristallnacht, they m -- the Jews were told that they had to go and clean up the mess.</sentence><sentence id="276">And my mother went back and she looked at it and she said, Ill never do that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="277">The Persian carpets were on the manure heap.</sentence><sentence id="278">The prayer books were full of eggs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="279">We still have some of them -- show you.</sentence><sentence id="280">And it was very, very difficult, but many -- not many, but several of the non-Jewish families came to her aid and helped her.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="281">And of course, food was very difficult to obtain at that time, and the people from the <span class="REGION">land</span> would come with baskets to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> to bring us food.</sentence><sentence id="282">As a matter of fact, they knew we would only eat kosher chickens, one woman came every week with a live chicken on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">And two of my uncles were Shochten, they had learned that, so that way we had our kosher chickens.</sentence><sentence id="284">You see, we -- we weren't -- we really did not any -- have any deprivations in that way, because people helped us.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: You said your mother handled the emigration work, what kind of work was she doing at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Well, she didn't do it alone, there was her sister, the cu -- and two cousins, and one of my unc -- two of ma -- of the cousin -- two of the three brothers that were cousins were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so they all had -- worked on it together.</sentence><sentence id="291">But you have to remember, we had a <span class="BUILDING">17 room house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">It was fully furnished, that you could find on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">Linens, clothing, everything in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was smashed.</sentence><sentence id="294">There wasn't a single piece that was left together.</sentence><sentence id="295">And at that time my mother went and bought a complete ha -- n-new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, dishes, pots, pans, housewares, linens.</sentence><sentence id="296">She bought everything new.</sentence><sentence id="297">She knew she was not allowed to take out any money when she left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">And everything she bought had to be paid to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, had to be documented, and the same amount of money had to be paid to the German government for export tax.</sentence><sentence id="299">And I would say 75 percent of the stuff that she bought was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> when the British bombed it in the -- in the port of Hamburg.</sentence><sentence id="300">And I think if you look at the bottom, you'll still find it there.</sentence><sentence id="301">So I would say 75 percent of the stuff she bought never -- never got to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Why <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
