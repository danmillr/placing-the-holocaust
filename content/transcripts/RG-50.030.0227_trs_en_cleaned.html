<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A:Uh my father uh was a very successful commander of the local battalion in the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="20">He was one of the very early educated, university educated, uh, young people so he immediately in the First World War got a commission in the Austro-Hungarian Army.</sentence><sentence id="21">In those days the army consisted of local battalions, people from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, from the same <span class="REGION">province</span> went together; and, uh, that goes back to the feudal ways, how armies were organized.</sentence><sentence id="22">Uh, my father, uh, brought many of the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local district</span> back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alive and, uh, after the First World War, he took his non-commissioned officers and, uh, set up a business where the non-commissioned officers from his</sentence><sentence id="24">battalion became his distributors and my father was the wholesaler, and by 1930 my father dominated the, uh, the oil, fertilizer and, uh, uh, flour distribution business in the, in the entire <span class="REGION">province</span>.</sentence><sentence id="25">In the, uh, mid-thirties, my father became a member of the, uh, provincial government, which was a part of...it was a sort of supervisory government on top of the bureaucracy and, uh, he became very closely associated with two priests, who, uh, subsequently figure very importantly in the events that happened sub...in the in the forties, and, uh, so my childhood was really, uh... as the only son...I had an older sister...of a very well-known public figure, and, uh, from my childhood I was aware of my father's position and his military background, which again will figure very importantly in, in the events to come.</sentence><sentence id="26">My mother and, uh, my father worked together in the <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">They were very close partners.</sentence><sentence id="28">The business was downstairs and we lived upstairs and, uh, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span>, and had the usual normal childhood until, uh, 1936 when I decided to join HaShomer HaTzair, which was a youth organization which, uh, had very strong, uh, views of its, of its role in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, especially with regard to the notion of HaShomer being the guardian.</sentence><sentence id="30">Again, this is an important heritage because HaShomer HaTzair, uh, provided the backbone of all the Jewish guerrillas in, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">It it was sort of assumed that, uh, HaShomer HaTzair will fight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q:How did you as a young man feel about it and, uh, why did you become involved in it?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q:<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">HaShomer HaTzair</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A:Oh, it's just uh...I don't know...you go with a certain crowd, uh, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">The...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">It's it's a provincial head...uh, center of fourteen thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="56">The</sentence><sentence id="58">Jewish population in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was about fourteen hundred.</sentence><sentence id="59">Uh, there were not that many organizations and HaShomer HaTzair was very well organized and it was the organization and the people and, uh, the young people I gravitated to.</sentence><sentence id="60">The other group was a religious group and, uh, although my mother was very religious and was kosher and my grandfather always took me to <span class="BUILDING">schul</span>, and I was a particularly good scholar, uh, my father and I were always sort of fairly, uh, liberal in our views from from the very childhood and therefore it was in...in...incomprehensible for me to join the the the religious part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">In fact the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> were really divided into three sort of groups.</sentence><sentence id="62">There were the the sort of conservative.</sentence><sentence id="63">Of course, this doesn't apply to the American definition of conservative.</sentence><sentence id="64">Uh there was reform conservative and then there was really the extremely religious Jews; and uh being uh very much involved in a community and uh with a father as a public figure and uh and particularly leader of HaShomer HaTzair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> uh who had quite a bit of training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palmach</span>, uh we we sort of were set up for this this kind of an experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q:Tell me what happened to you as uh as things began to change in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A:Uh we had a...a very difficult decision.</sentence><sentence id="82">We were going to leave in uh 1938.</sentence><sentence id="83">My father decided uh to leave and we were all set up to leave.</sentence><sentence id="84">We had passports and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: What?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A:Uh my father was a fairly astute individual and he felt that the situation was untenable and becoming more so.</sentence><sentence id="92">Uh he uh uh interpreted the the the the experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> uh much more correctly than others did and he just did not feel that he wanted to to risk his family uh to the uh to the sort of experience that was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and uh so we were going to leave uh the uh...we were sort of stashing money away.</sentence><sentence id="93">My</sentence><sentence id="95">my mother, who was always the treasurer of the uh of the, of the family...as we got money and change it into foreign currency ... you know, uh mother took it and put it into a a metal box which she uh hid upstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">The week when we were supposed to leave in 1938, she went up to withdraw the money.</sentence><sentence id="97">The box had fallen behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiator</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam radiator</span>; nevertheless the metal box focused the heat out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam radiator</span> and all the money that was in there, which was our escape money, was charred and my father never said a bad word about it.</sentence><sentence id="99">In addition to that, there were uncles and grandparents and the whole family...my father was sort of the kapo of the family, I mean in the in the uh in the grand...godfather kind of a style...I mean there was a whole series of retinues, and uh uh my father, although he could have left totally poor and destitute uh between having no money at all and uh and uh the fact that there were just too many people who we couldn't take with us, my father decided to stay.</sentence><sentence id="100">So that what happened in'38.</sentence><sentence id="101">In'39 uh we uh started uh looking at the way how to change our relationships and at that time my father anticipated that the business would be taken away so he started uh really working with one of his confidants to divest himself of the business and in that respect my father was very forward looking.</sentence><sentence id="102">Of course when when the extreme measures came and particularly the legislation which started in, late in 1940 uh which was a very elaborate process for uh expropriating the Jews before destroying them, uh my father was sufficiently skilled to uh to uh divest himself of things before people divested him of it.</sentence><sentence id="103">In addition to that his relationships with the uh two priests who were prominent including the Catholic priest, a man by the name of Branecky, who just by coincidence was in the same <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> as Dr. Joseph Tiso, who became the quisling president of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, uh Branecky assured him that whatever will happen to Jews, uh Branecky personally protect my father because of the services my father has rendered to the community, so uh we in many respects always anticipated the losses that were coming and uh we divested of property.</sentence><sentence id="104">We moved out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">Uh, we moved uh started moving into less and less uh proper <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">We ultimately ended in a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, sort of in the slums of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span></sentence><sentence id="108">but but uh at least the, the family stayed together and uh although the cousins and the nieces and the uh in-laws were all deported in'42.</sentence><sentence id="109">My father couldn't protect them anymore.</sentence><sentence id="110">Uh, my father, uh, with the protection of Branecky got a presidential writ which protected my father uh from deportation.</sentence><sentence id="111">My father continued working in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> which was economically very important for for <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> because still of the distribution of oil and fertilizer and flour, so my father continued actually managing the enterprise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q:Can you pause a little bit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A:Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q:Uh Paul, tell us what it was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> from 1940, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="142">You have described what was happening to your family, but I'd like to know a little bit more about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, what life was like for you as a young man during that period.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A:Well, my life was revolving around uh the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and HaShomer HaTzair and uh as 1940 came to pass, uh there were restrictions where you could go for instance.</sentence><sentence id="146">There were certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we could not go hiking anymore.</sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, you couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">movies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">By 1940 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span> were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="149">Um... by 1941 you couldn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">Uh by uh early 1941 the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> had to collapse itself, all of its grades, into a small <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">I mean there was continual, almost monthly, new regulation and proscriptions and prescriptions of what you could or couldn't do.</sentence><sentence id="152">Uh by 1941 you had to wear a yellow star, and that meant that when you walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> uh when the local ruffians wanted to beat you up, uh they just beat you up.</sentence><sentence id="153">Of course that led to the fact that we always went together as crowd.</sentence><sentence id="154">I mean there were no rough tactics like using knives or anything like that...it was just uh sticks and fists.</sentence><sentence id="155">So, you know, 1940, 1941 uh was conversion of HaShomer HaTzair into sort of a youth gang.</sentence><sentence id="156">Uh from a childhood</sentence><sentence id="158">standpoint actually, uh it was a wonderful experience.</sentence><sentence id="159">It sort of made things very intense and very important, and suddenly things became just very very ... things which you would not have believed were important became very important.</sentence><sentence id="160">For instance uh most of the Jews had to get rid of their books.</sentence><sentence id="161">You were not allowed to have books.</sentence><sentence id="162">I mean there's lots of things...you couldn't have this, this and that, so the notion that you could read a book, or that somebody owned a book, was a matter of great importance because if you could borrow a book uh and you had a book or you had access to somebody who borrowed your book, that was subject of very very much conversation--who reads what.</sentence><sentence id="163">It became a very intense kind of a life..-uh life became very precious.</sentence><sentence id="164">Uh so so I'm not looking at that period in fact uh with with dismay.</sentence><sentence id="165">It became a very very intensive life where every moment mattered and everything mattered, and you became very cautious and very very forward looking, very calculating, and very well organized, so.... Of course by the end of 1940 or early in 1941, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was dissolved.</sentence><sentence id="166">Uh, it just happened that my father arranged for some people, and and there were some refugees, to to start tutoring me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; so starting in 1941, I had private tutors including some very distinguished uh people who otherwise would have, I would never have met in terms of education.</sentence><sentence id="167">Uh I started studying English in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="168">I had an excellent uh English teacher from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">| didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">We were not allowed to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, but uh the local music teacher who was the wife of a local judge let me practice on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">It it's that sort of experiences ... they are they are sort of savoring life and savoring experiences.</sentence><sentence id="172">Uh, you know, sure I got beaten up, but we also beat up some of them too, I mean, so uh we learned how to do dirty fighting and kicking.</sentence><sentence id="173">Uh we did not always run.</sentence><sentence id="174">Most of the time we did.</sentence><sentence id="175">Uh and the relationship between the the the young people, I mean the people with whom I was in those days uh...I mean and and one of them is in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, one of them is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, one of them is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, and they're all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="176">I can pick up the phone and talk to them like I can talk to nobody.</sentence><sentence id="177">Uh, a few months ago one of these boys who was with me uh wrote me a letter and in the letter he just mentioned that he has</sentence><sentence id="179">tremendous headaches and uh that uh the doctors in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> can't find out what's wrong with him, so I get the letter uh in the morning, I call up uh the other boy who was part of the group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, and I said, uh, Sano has headaches.</sentence><sentence id="180">If I send him by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> tomorrow morning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> can you take care...can you take him to a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="181">He said of course.</sentence><sentence id="182">You know, it's like, you know, you know, like like continuing the same conversation of fifty years ago.</sentence><sentence id="183">I pick up the phone.</sentence><sentence id="184">I call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sano</span> in Europe, I said there is a ticket waiting for you.</sentence><sentence id="185">Uh you just walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">travel agency</span> and hop on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and Francl will pick you up at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">Now he hasn't seen Francl in fifty years, but, you know, it was just...it's that kind of a relationship.</sentence><sentence id="187">I, I don't have with nobody...I, I wouldn't pick up a phone like that with anybody else except my nearest family or my children, so you know, coming back to the forties and you want to get the spirit...it's, it's life of great intensity.</sentence><sentence id="188">It's life of great, uh, changing of outlook.</sentence><sentence id="189">Things become very precious, very important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q:And uh the noose then begins to tighten.</sentence><sentence id="240">What happens....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A:And as the noose becomes tightened, of course, then uh, you know, when the deportations start and this this is very ugly, uh but it's very bureaucratized.</sentence><sentence id="244">You know, the lists are made up, and, and, and in fact the the Jewish council administers the list, so the the Gestapo has just a few people.</sentence><sentence id="245">Then they have the Hlinka Guards, the quislings, and then you have the local gendarmes, and the whole thing is organized as a machine, and the machine uh because of its bureaucratic approach, becomes predictable which means that if you're skillful and if you have pull, uh you can anticipate the motions and then you can almost figure out the odds of survival and so life becomes on the part of my father very much preoccupied with understanding which way the laws are going and what do you give up in order to protect, so in 1942 when the uh deportations begin, my father is uh advised that, "Yes, we can protect you but if you would get baptized uh it would look</sentence><sentence id="247">better because it would allow us to reclassify you from column 4BC to column 4DA which is a different priority."</sentence><sentence id="248">See, by that time uh the whole question of destruction becomes an arithmetic calculation.</sentence><sentence id="249">Who owes what favor to whom, what can you do to protect.</sentence><sentence id="250">And by the way, that is the sort of mentality that continues afterwards under the communist regime.</sentence><sentence id="251">It it is not just a Holocaust experience.</sentence><sentence id="252">It is a totalitarian experience.</sentence><sentence id="253">It's a Kafka's, Kafka-like experience, except it's accentuated because now the game becomes deadly, so my father said fine.</sentence><sentence id="254">OK.</sentence><sentence id="255">You know, you want to reclassify.</sentence><sentence id="256">Fine.</sentence><sentence id="257">We get baptized.</sentence><sentence id="258">I just got bar mitzvah in January "42, so then Father comes back and said you know, and we have to get baptized.</sentence><sentence id="259">Fine Dad.</sentence><sentence id="260">You know, how do we do that?Well, you know, uh we have to sort of get the thing organized and you have to qualify.</sentence><sentence id="261">We cannot get you into the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> because it takes too long and it requires Archbishop dispensation and it would take a couple of years, but uh you can get baptized in the <span class="BUILDING">Evangelic Church</span>, which was a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">Uh and the Protestants are more flexible because of the heritage and we can do the whole thing in eight months and you have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn the catechism and so forth, so part of the experience is one of how to survive in a totalitarian environment, how to adapt, how to change your skins, your habits, your behavior, because that is what the rules require.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q:How did you go about it?</sentence><sentence id="287">How did this process of becoming ___ educated to become baptized, how did it...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A:Oh there is a procedure for that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q:I know.</sentence><sentence id="293">But how did...yes, I understand that.</sentence><sentence id="294">What I want to know is what did Paul Strassman do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A:Oh, I, I, I'm, I'm a I'ma very skillful, highly disciplined young man who can concentrate, and if you have to learn the catechism and you have to learn the New Testament, uh, you know, it's it's a drill like learning anything else, so you know, if you have to learn things in order to get...you have to learn the tfillin to get bar bar mitzvah and read the Tanach to be bar mitzvah, well fine.</sentence><sentence id="302">They want me to do something else, I can do that too.</sentence><sentence id="303">It's, it's, uh, it's an adaptability, so if they want, you know...now they want me to jump through this loop, I'll go through this loop.</sentence><sentence id="304">If they want me to jump through this <span class="DLF">hoop</span>, it that, it the price of survival and you know the calculation of this thing...you know classifica...reclassification from 4AB to 4DE means that you have another year to go.</sentence><sentence id="305">OK.</sentence><sentence id="306">And if that's what it takes, that's what you do.</sentence><sentence id="307">So it is the mental process that I'm trying to convey to you is that the genocide is a bureaucratic process with stipulated rules which all have escape clauses and that is not just genocide although it's, again let me emphasize, genocide is deadly.</sentence><sentence id="308">But it is a process which is almost banal in its bureaucratic predictability and manipulability and those who survive are the individuals who either have the power or the money and the know-how, but you have to have all three in order to be able to deal with that system.</sentence><sentence id="309">Now uh there are <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there is no escape clauses.</sentence><sentence id="310">When you're dealing with the Gestapo there is no escape clauses.</sentence><sentence id="311">Although even there there are escape clauses of sorts.</sentence><sentence id="312">Uh of course they are at a completely different level, but under the <span class="REGION">Slovak Republic</span> which basically was a corrupt republic, um and uh a republic that always wanted to have an alibi for certain people...you know, there was...you always built an alibi for the next thing and if somebody's powerful and is protected by Branecky, well he must be important.</sentence><sentence id="313">If you want to preserve your options in the <span class="REGION">Slovak Republic</span> you can navigate through that uh that uh environment and and if you know how to do it, you can survive a little longer than somebody else who does not know.</sentence><sentence id="314">The Jews who are deported in "42 are the powerless, the uh...they are the true victims.</sentence><sentence id="315">They are the ones who are not going to fit into the society very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q:Did you see those deportations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A:Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="341">You know, the the lists were drawn up....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q:I'd like you to describe one deportation that you saw for us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A:Well, you you, there is a list that is drawn up and you know the night before from the friendly local gendarmes who is on the list.</sentence><sentence id="347">OK?</sentence><sentence id="348">Uh some people don't know that.</sentence><sentence id="349">Some people who are on the list don't find out, but if you are connected, you find out.</sentence><sentence id="350">There's always the last moments scurrying around, you know...can I get off the list?</sentence><sentence id="351">In "42 there's still the presumption, well we are just going from a very bad situation to just a worse situation.</sentence><sentence id="352">We are going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">The whole question of <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and so forth is is absolutely not known in "42.</sentence><sentence id="354">Uh all the subsequent evidence shows that that uh that that some of the evidence is coming in at late "42, early "43 and that is being hidden, but in "42 the idea of deportation is just we're going to the next level of negotiation.</sentence><sentence id="355">OK.Now we're going to be entren...no, we already gave up, we already went through twelve circles of <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">OK.</sentence><sentence id="357">And so well, there's just another circle of <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">OK, well what else can they do?</sentence><sentence id="359">OK.</sentence><sentence id="360">Uh of course the the war doesn't look very good in "42, so uh the whole notion of going into any sort of resistance is totally utopian except under very extreme conditions.</sentence><sentence id="361">Uh there is already the first group of Jews who go into the uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> with arms in "42.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q:Are you...were you and your father aware of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A:I wasn't, but my father was.</sentence><sentence id="382">And my father, considering the military situation and the fact that the front was, you know, a thousand, two hundred kilometers away and there was nothing</sentence><sentence id="384">1 on the west, my father's military assessment was, you know, this is an option that uh that is a, you know, this is the twelve... twentieth level of <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">OK.</sentence><sentence id="386">But the survivability of a family uh, you know...and at that time I'm thirteen years old and I have a sister...survivability in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">I mean, you have to get to other levels of degradation before you take that option, although starting in "42 my father starts doing something very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="388">Uh my father...and it has something to do with the squalid circumstances under which we live, although my mother made it, you know...it was quite presentable.</sentence><sentence id="389">I mean I I didn't suffer.</sentence><sentence id="390">We ate, you know, and the family life was very close.</sentence><sentence id="391">Uh, certain <span class="NPIP">things</span> were in short supply, so what?</sentence><sentence id="392">But uh my father starts taking us out...there were certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> which, where we were permitted to go for hikes, certain <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">These were sometimes arbitrary restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="394">In other words, many of the laws as they came in...there was this <span class="BUILDING">bureaucratic factory</span> churning out new restrictive laws.</sentence><sentence id="395">They would...say..."What else can we do to these people?"</sentence><sentence id="396">You know, "What next tightening of the screw can we do to make them miserable?"</sentence><sentence id="397">But there was a whole <span class="REGION">region</span>, a whole <span class="REGION">area</span> where, which was really away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">provincial town</span> which was open, and so starting in "42, certainly in "43, my father takes us out for hikes, very long two-day hikes, and we spent lots of time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="398">My father always liked the <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span>, but it also means we get away from the oppressive environment.</sentence><sentence id="399">When you get get out to the uh small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">peasant villages</span> out there the the, you know, it's different.</sentence><sentence id="400">The, the antisemitism is urban.</sentence><sentence id="401">It's connected with Jewish concentration where they have Jewish merchants and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="402">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> you don't have that.</sentence><sentence id="403">In addition to that, in these various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were all of my father's little friends, so we could always stop in an <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> which was owned by a guy who most likely owed his life to my father, and certainly owed his livelihood to my father, and this was...my father was the kapo and these these were the soldiers out there, so we go out to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and um clearly my father had this, you know, going out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and surviving option on his mind because it was quite clear that if the Germans lose the war, and it was questionable in "42, uh, the front</sentence><sentence id="405">2 will come over and then the question is what do you do in the transition.</sentence><sentence id="406">You clearly have to get out of the urban environment where the fighting will take place.</sentence><sentence id="407">So we get baptized in "42.</sentence><sentence id="408">I get bar mitzvah January 24, 1942, I get baptized in October.</sentence><sentence id="409">I'm very good at that by the way.</sentence><sentence id="410">I mean I mean the, the, the, uh, I mean this was very professionally done.</sentence><sentence id="411">I mean this was a proper baptism and the catechism and the whole thing and I'm very good at that.</sentence><sentence id="412">It turns that theologically the Lutheran religion appeals to me more than the Jewish religion because the Jewish religion is so obscure and so full of, you know, archaic rituals and the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran Church</span> in, uh, in, uh, in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> in in 1940's was very modern, forward looking, highly educated <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and that particular <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a very small minority so when the Lutherans are a minority they are very nice people.</sentence><sentence id="413">Because, you know, they live in this <span class="BUILDING">Catholic sea</span> and uh, you know, then you suddenly can go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, any <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414">They play Bach, and suddenly you can go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday and it's perfectly legitimate.</sentence><sentence id="415">You're expected to.</sentence><sentence id="416">You know, you're baptized and the people are very nice.</sentence><sentence id="417">Lutherans say, well, you know, it's it jolly, you know, you know.</sentence><sentence id="418">You know, we got some Jews you know.</sentence><sentence id="419">Jesus Christ was a Jew and the Old Testament we read once in a while, you know.</sentence><sentence id="420">The more the merrier, and besides Mr. Zeman who was the other priest who uh, uh, liked my father very well and they were quite close...they were really friends, you know, always saw to it that on the way out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> he stopped and talked to my father and talked to me and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="421">And old Zeman really liked me because, you know, I knew the catechism as as good as any, you know...he used...once, once Zeman said a terrible thing which my father sort of laughed about.</sentence><sentence id="422">Uh Zeman was teaching some kind of a theological discussion to a <span class="BUILDING">class</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Sunday class</span>, and this kid just didn't know the answers, so Zeman say, "Well why don't you go and talk to Strassman.</sentence><sentence id="423">He'll explain it to you," and so the kid say, "Well, that's easy.</sentence><sentence id="424">He's a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="425">He knows it." (</sentence><sentence id="426">Laughter) You know, it was a reference to the Old Testament.</sentence><sentence id="427">My fath...father delighted in stories like that.</sentence><sentence id="428">So by end of "42, out of fourteen hundred Jews, uh we are down to about a hundred and fifty Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="430">3 the deportations come in.</sentence><sentence id="431">They are scheduled.</sentence><sentence id="432">There is this scurrying.</sentence><sentence id="433">Uh in the morning the local gendarme knocks at your <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is on a <span class="DLF">siding</span> already scheduled.</sentence><sentence id="435">The whole thing is scheduled.</sentence><sentence id="436">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is, it's usually uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> but sometimes it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>, and uh and the gendarme comes and he gives you a piece of paper you have to sign.</sentence><sentence id="437">Uh early they uh in the first set of deportations uh they actually come for the young people first because they go through the pretense that this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, so let's take the young people.</sentence><sentence id="438">So the parents have to sign a receipt for their son and then they have to sign that they receive a receipt.</sentence><sentence id="439">Procedure calls for that.</sentence><sentence id="440">And so the thing is just denuded, and of course everybody is trying to scurry.</sentence><sentence id="441">Everybody's trying to look for exemption but but...and everybody knows that there is a certain number of Jews who are not going to get to report although nobody knows how many.</sentence><sentence id="442">This is always kept open.</sentence><sentence id="443">And then there is a list and there are grades of protection.</sentence><sentence id="444">There is so-called a presidential exemption, and there is economic essential uh exemption.</sentence><sentence id="445">Then there is an exemption for people who were government employees.</sentence><sentence id="446">In in other words there's grades of exemption.</sentence><sentence id="447">Uh everybody spends a great deal of time trying to figure out what level of exemption they have.</sentence><sentence id="448">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> takes them...and people just go fairly uh fairly ... you know, you go and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="449">Uh there are rules.</sentence><sentence id="450">You can take only twenty kilos per person.</sentence><sentence id="451">Uh there's a big discussion ...well, what do you take?You know, do you take pots and pans, or don't you take pots and pans.</sentence><sentence id="452">Uh there is big discussion to the Judensrat, you know...uh give us a list of what to take.</sentence><sentence id="453">Do we take pots and pans?</sentence><sentence id="454">OK.</sentence><sentence id="455">And and those kind of questions.</sentence><sentence id="456">And the whole thing becomes involved in the minutia.</sentence><sentence id="457">The tragedies are not visible.</sentence><sentence id="458">There is not weeping or tearing.</sentence><sentence id="459">There is very little force.</sentence><sentence id="460">It is...you see you have now you have been through two years of being degraded more and more, so this is just another level of degradation, and by the way, you are going to _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transhipment camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">OK.</sentence><sentence id="462">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">staging camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="463">And there are people who are able to get exemptions out of _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="464">In other words, you are shipped to _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> but that's not the final because you could still then protest and if you</sentence><sentence id="466">4 meet certain requirements you get an exemption to be pulled out of _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span>, so so the energies are invested in trying to escape, and that fits very well with the mentality of survival which is centuries and centuries old and that the Jews survive by bending, accommodating and negotiating.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="831">Q:Again, I need to pull you back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="833">A:And and our family just lived in that environment and starting in "44, everybody starts saying OK, now now uh when the war comes in, how do we survive,

which you live are going to be thrown out, because then uh you have a different law.</sentence><sentence id="835">You also must understand that the quisling government found it very convenient and so did the Germans uh to sort of have</sentence><sentence id="837">0 their own order because that gives them jobs, nationalistic and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="838">And of course the Nazis had other fish to fry and as long as the quislings controlled things...OK.So you want to keep your eight thousand Jews or outofthem__.._I'm going to worry about other things, you know, like the

id="840">OK.</sentence><sentence id="841">And there are documents to that effect, and so starting in early "44, the family starts becoming concerned about how to survive the transition and this is

id="847">This bricklayer finds in that old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> where he's going to make a false <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> and my

liberation scenario becomes very important.</sentence><sentence id="862">At this particular time my father said, "Well we are going to take the option of dispersing the family.</sentence><sentence id="863">We're not going to be together.</sentence><sentence id="864">You're going to go here.</sentence><sentence id="865">You're going to go here...we go to here..." and these things...these are nego...these deals are negotiated.</sentence><sentence id="866">So that's what's early "44.Meanwhile the plots are being hatched and there is news that uh parachutists are dropping uh during the night, and you know, getting ready for the transition and so forth, because everybody is getting ready for for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to collapse any moment.</sentence><sentence id="867">Now this is early "44, again.</sentence><sentence id="868">Am I answering your...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="925">Q:Early "44?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="927">A:Early "44 the quisling army, the two divisions that fight for the for the, uh, Slovak quisling government, uh, makes a deal with the London government [NB: the Czechoslovak government in exile] and the idea is that when the time comes to, uh, for the Russians to cross over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian mountains</span>, uh, that government will come in, the Slovak army will attack the Germans in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> passes from the rear, hold ground until the army can come over and uh that's how it would be.</sentence><sentence id="928">We will liberate <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="929">Uh, the deal is made, uh, in May, but that's when the news comes out what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>."!</sentence><sentence id="930">As you know...again it was a western inspired, western led uprising that uh led to the Russians stopping at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Visla</span> [NB: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span>], and letting the Germans wipe them out.</sentence><sentence id="931">So another meeting takes place and the idea now is to make a deal with the communists, who also have an army running under the Soviet command from the east, and say we are going to make this join and in order to cooperate with the with the uh Soviets we are going to put the communists in charge and so late in May a meeting is held where the communists are going to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="30.523">Kiev</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the uh Russian army is headed by a man by the name of Krushchev, Nikita Krushchev [NB: at this time, acting as Commissar of the Soviet partisans], and the timing of the Russian attacking is the <span class="DLF">mountain pass</span> and the communist leadership now of the Slovak underground will be coordinated so we don't have a situation like in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="932">Turns out the communists don't keep their part of the deal.</sentence><sentence id="933">They actually never communicate with the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="934">The communists were totally " The Warsaw Revolt began in early August 1944.</sentence><sentence id="936">3 different scenario and in fact they want to repeat the same thing that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and so the communists rather than wait for a coordinated army and underground and communists and Russian attack across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in August in large quantity into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and these saboteurs without any coordination with anybody, stopped the night <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that goes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="937">Just happens on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> are twenty-eight German generals.</sentence><sentence id="938">Line them up on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ru_omberok</span> and shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="939">The following day uh my father says "OK.</sentence><sentence id="940">This is it.</sentence><sentence id="941">We are going to go into our escape plan.</sentence><sentence id="942">We are going to execute our escape plan.</sentence><sentence id="943">We are going to disperse," and so that morning which is the 28th of uh 27th of August, 1944, uh we go and we get dropped off in the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and we stay there.</sentence><sentence id="944">Well it turns out that the Germans are a little slow to react.</sentence><sentence id="945">They take some retaliatory action which is local but there is no Sonderkommando, not anything.</sentence><sentence id="946">And also the uh the <span class="BUILDING">base</span> which is the business, it still has to be run and so after two days in our <span class="NPIP">locations</span>, uh my uh my father is told uh look, you better come back.</sentence><sentence id="947">This is...you jumped the gun a little.</sentence><sentence id="948">You...it's premature.</sentence><sentence id="949">So the whole family retrieves from the pre-staged <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and we go back where we were.</sentence><sentence id="950">OK.</sentence><sentence id="951">Now this is a fatal mistake.</sentence><sentence id="952">But it leads...it's it's part of really not understanding what was really going on.</sentence><sentence id="953">Uh and because of course the Russians are not crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathians</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">The Russians have no intentions of crossing.</sentence><sentence id="955">They just start a new offensive in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> is not even on the map of of being crossed.</sentence><sentence id="956">What the Germans meanwhile do is they just land Sonderkommandos for the sole purpose of disarming the Slovak army, the various Slovak, uh, uh, Slovak, uh, garrisons.</sentence><sentence id="957">They successfully disarmed the <span class="REGION">eastern division</span>, which was the highly armed, which was the spear-head of this whole plot.</sentence><sentence id="958">They totally disarmed them and they shoot the, uh, the, uh, the key generals who staged it...who were going to stage that thing because all of this thing is leaked out.</sentence><sentence id="959">The western division, which is about thirty-five thousand men, um, just escape the garrisons before the Germans can get there to disarm them.</sentence><sentence id="960">The, the soldiers mutiny and just take to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and that happens late on</sentence><sentence id="962">4 the 29th of August.</sentence><sentence id="963">At this particular point, the Germans come over and then the fighting starts between the the, uh, Slovak soldiers of the western division and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="964">Uh, on the night of the 29th of August, uh, for reasons which I still don't understand, my father decided, "Why don't you sleep <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tonight and just why, why don't you go and sleep somewhere else so that the whole family's not together," although we are still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>.</sentence><sentence id="965">And I go to sleep at a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a friend, uh, who was half-Jewish and they were workers and, and, and somehow...nobody every paid attention to them.</sentence><sentence id="966">I just slept there.</sentence><sentence id="967">Early in the morning I get the message during the night the Gestapo came and took twelve hostages, and my father was one of the hostages.</sentence><sentence id="968">They were...he was not taken as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="969">He was taken as the head operator.</sentence><sentence id="970">Subsequently in "45, I find out that my father was involved in shipping food, uh, into illegal food caches that were being already staged starting in May, so that when the army starts holding against the Germans there is food already in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> being staged for the for the uh for the soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="971">So in the morning uh my father gets taken away.</sentence><sentence id="972">They were looking for me.</sentence><sentence id="973">All the males were going to be taken.</sentence><sentence id="974">I wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="975">They just came in...they came in during the night.</sentence><sentence id="976">Again this was totally irregular.</sentence><sentence id="977">Whenever Jews were taken, you know, the local gendarmerie came with the bureaucratic procedure, and there was a time to be warned.</sentence><sentence id="978">The Germans...there was no warning.</sentence><sentence id="979">They just took, uh, uh, some some people who are involved, uh, in in the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="980">They were taken as hostages, and so now, uh, the message comes for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="981">You know, I never see my mother again.</sentence><sentence id="982">Uh, we cannot go back to where we were before.</sentence><sentence id="983">We blew our cover.</sentence><sentence id="984">We go to a <span class="NPIP">fallback position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="985">In other words, there were two layers of <span class="NPIP">places</span> to go to and so I leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was sleeping, with this friend, and go to an employee of my father who was in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> outside of of of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">My sister goes to another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="987">My mother goes to another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="988">So the family gets dispersed.</sentence><sentence id="989">We go into what's called bunker mode, which is you go somewhere and you're going to be hidden somewhere in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> or something until the war blows over, but my father isn't there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="990">OK.</sentence><sentence id="991">My father</sentence><sentence id="993">5 gets taken.</sentence><sentence id="994">Uh he gets tortured and he gets shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> where he's killed, but he gets shipped with the uh uprising.</sentence><sentence id="995">Uh there's a whole group of people involved in the uprising who who gets uh who gets annihilated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="996">So I go over to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this this fallback, second position uh backup.</sentence><sentence id="997">And I'm there one night.</sentence><sentence id="998">In the morning the wife of this employee comes in all panicky.</sentence><sentence id="999">This employee had a young wife, recently married.</sentence><sentence id="1000">He was a much older man.</sentence><sentence id="1001">This was his second marriage.</sentence><sentence id="1002">The girl was sort of a floozy or whatever and uh she comes in all alarmed.</sentence><sentence id="1003">She's a new wife, and says, "Look...the Germans are doing <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to house search," and by that time the Germans announced that "If we find any uh partisans, soldiers or Jews uh we are going to shoot them and also shoot every inhabitant in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1004">So the wife gets very alarmed and this newly married older guy goes to me and says, "Look, why don't you just go away for the day out to the to the to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where there are thrushes and bushes...you know, it's it's fairly wooded and near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1005">Throughout the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> flows a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> by the name of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vah</span> and there are all kinds of <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="1006">Why don't you stay there?</sentence><sentence id="1007">And uh then come back in the evening and we'll see how things go."</sentence><sentence id="1008">Now remember...I'm fifteen years old, so L..and oh...and I get a sandwich.</sentence><sentence id="1009">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1010">I go in my sandals, in my short shoes, a shirt a belt and a sandwich, for the day at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Now you also must understand that through all of this time I know the <span class="REGION">area</span> extremely well, and I'ma fabulous swimmer because we swim quite a bit in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1012">It's a wild <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1013">It has it has it has uh rapids too, and we swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rapids</span> and so forth, but you know...and it's it's part of the training and oh...we swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> because we couldn't go to the only <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1014">Since 1940 Jews are not allowed to go to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> so you learn how to swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, which is dangerous and full of rapids, but it's fun.</sentence><sentence id="1015">I told you, you know, hardship creates fun too.</sentence><sentence id="1016">So I go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I sit there and during the day I see on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> coming in and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and the Germans are really moving in.</sentence><sentence id="1017">Now the Germans are coming in full force.</sentence><sentence id="1018">The army has basically abandoned the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1019">There is a huge <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in</sentence><sentence id="1021">6 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1022"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> is a is a <span class="BUILDING">regiment headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1023">It's it's a strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1024">Always has been.</sentence><sentence id="1025">It is...by the way, it is a strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> since Roman times, so it's one of the old, old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Roman camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1026">It's it's a throttle of the of the valley, and there I see the Germans going up and down.</sentence><sentence id="1027">By about three o'clock in the afternoon I hear lots of shooting out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, which is in the direction which I knew very well which we...because we hiked there.</sentence><sentence id="1028">And by four o'clock in the afternoon I decided I'm not going to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this employee where his wife is not sure that really she she likes me and and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1029">It it's purely an instinct.</sentence><sentence id="1030">It's it's...1 don't know...you you learn it as an animal.</sentence><sentence id="1031">There are certain survival uh instincts that you have and I say I will not be able to last there a couple of months.</sentence><sentence id="1032">I mean you are fifteen years old but you can...you know now how to make calculations.</sentence><sentence id="1033">And I say well, they are shooting so that means that that's good news, because you know, if they're shooting there that means that there are some friends out there.</sentence><sentence id="1034">So about four o'clock in the afternoon I uh take off my shirt, take the sandals, tie them up on my head with my belt, and I go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I swim down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, under the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> where the Nazis go up and down, and I swim for about five kilometers, totally out of range of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, get out, know the <span class="REGION">area</span> extremely well...we hiked there.</sentence><sentence id="1035">It's a very picturesque <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1036">It's it's it's a it's a valley surrounded by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> on both sides, highly wooded, and I start marching late in the evening through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and and if you know that <span class="REGION">area</span> these are small land-holdings and there are little <span class="DLF">paths</span>, there are just millions of little <span class="DLF">paths</span> between each <span class="REGION">property</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1037">This...these are not big <span class="DLF">fields</span> and and there are there are <span class="DLF">tree lines</span> and there are bushes so there is always a place to hide and I walk in my shorts in this thing and and again my not being sort of alienated, not being an urban Jew, I just walked through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and the, you know, the the peasants see me.</sentence><sentence id="1038">You know, you say uh the right thing...you...there is, there is a way...you know, bless the God and you know, the answer...bless the Mary and you know you...there there are greetings because the peasants are really very religious.</sentence><sentence id="1039">These are small semi-feudal kind of <span class="BUILDING">enclaves</span>, uh but you can walk free right though those <span class="BUILDING">enclaves</span></sentence><sentence id="1041">7 and I get up to the <span class="DLF">mountain line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1042">There is lots of shooting going on there, and I run into a bunch of soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1043">These are who from the <span class="BUILDING">Tren_in garrison</span>, and they are resting there with a machine gun and and rifles and what have you, and uh I say, "You know, I would like to join you."</sentence><sentence id="1044">So the sergeant says, "You are a Jew aren't you?" "</sentence><sentence id="1045">Yah, lama Jew."</sentence><sentence id="1046">He says, "Well, we...you know, you are just a kid.</sentence><sentence id="1047">We don't...we are out for serious business on the...we are going to be fighting the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1048">Uh we can't have somebody...you have never shot a rifle.</sentence><sentence id="1049">We don't need you."</sentence><sentence id="1050">I said, you know, "But look, I I really need help."</sentence><sentence id="1051">So they said, "Look, kid.</sentence><sentence id="1052">Here is a hand grenade.</sentence><sentence id="1053">We'll give you a hand grenade but just go away."</sentence><sentence id="1054">So I say, "Well, what do you do with a hand grenade?"</sentence><sentence id="1055">So the guy shows me how to unlatch a hand grenade, close the hand grenade, and puts me away.</sentence><sentence id="1056">So I wander through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> (cough) for about a day with a hand grenade.</sentence><sentence id="1057">I stop at...there is a <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> up there and I go to the uh keeper of the <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> and I said, you know, I would like some food.</sentence><sentence id="1058">He gives me plenty of food.</sentence><sentence id="1059">Of course, I carry the hand grenade.</sentence><sentence id="1060">I'm quickly learning the trick how you get food.</sentence><sentence id="1061">And so I wander around and then on the second or third day...I don't know which anymore...and of course I sleep out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1062">I know how to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Although I've no clothing, there is a way of taking pine branches and sleeping out there.</sentence><sentence id="1064">You you really can do that.</sentence><sentence id="1065">I mean if if you...it's not that difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1066">And there are lots of hay rakes, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, so you can always take some straw out of a hay rake, make a bedding out of uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine</span> and then put straw on it and then cover yourself with straw...you can be very comfortable, and if it rains you go into a hay rake.</sentence><sentence id="1067">There's all kinds of shooting going on all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but it's very spotty.</sentence><sentence id="1068">On this morning of the third day I suddenly see a tall figure coming up the <span class="DLF">path</span> with obviously a heavy gun or something and I hide behind a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, unlatch my hand grenade and when the guy passes me I just stick my hand with the hand grenade behind his back and said, "Give me your gun."</sentence><sentence id="1069">The guy turns around and it is a officer who is in civilian clothing who is taking a heavy machine gun over.</sentence><sentence id="1070">He's going to join the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1071">He's looking for the partisans</sentence><sentence id="1073">8 the way I am looking for them.</sentence><sentence id="1074">So he said, "Kid, do you know what you're doing?</sentence><sentence id="1075">I mean are sure you know how to put the pin back?"</sentence><sentence id="1076">So uh, you know, after he identifies himself I finally put the pin back and say, "Well, you and I are going to go and look for the partisans together," so we walk for about a half a day, and then we come in at the bottom of the <span class="DLF">mountain range</span> and there we see at the...from the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> a bunch of guys... obviously not soldiers, funny looking guys, running around and there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> there, and so uh Kartal, the the officer, said, "You know, I'm going to cover you with the machine.</sentence><sentence id="1077">Why don't you go down there and find out what those guys are...are they our side or what are they."</sentence><sentence id="1078">See meanwhile of course the guards and the quislings also had uh civil guards and battalions and all kinds of arms things...I mean this was all mished, messed up, so I put my hand grenade and walked down, and there is this funny looking little squat guy and, uh, his only right hand and his left hand is chopped off and, uh, he carries Soviet stars on his on his epaulets.</sentence><sentence id="1079">And, uh, it turns out to be one of these special commando groups that were dropped by the Soviets two weeks before, and these are really professional killers.</sentence><sentence id="1080">These are real guerrillas.</sentence><sentence id="1081">This is...these are people who have been through the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> in a guerrilla warfare for two, three years, and they are collecting apparently squat.</sentence><sentence id="1082">They just came from scouting around looking for the <span class="DLF">rail line</span> and when they came, the <span class="DLF">rail line</span> was too far away so I...they start immediately quizzing me and I say, well, I have a partner up there.</sentence><sentence id="1083">They see a heavy machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="1084">They say, "Well, we like you guys," so they immediately take the officer with the heavy machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="1085">They need a heavy machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Uh, they they say, "Well, what do we do with you kid?"</sentence><sentence id="1087">And I say, "Well, you know, I really know this <span class="REGION">area</span> very well," so the uh the Russian who's...you know, "you can really understand Russian reasonable well."</sentence><sentence id="1088">This was the Ukrainian uh said, "you know, we really could use somebody who knows the <span class="REGION">local area</span> to walk ahead of us and, you know, we'll dress you up in some ragged peasant stuff and you will just...we'll we'll use you as a as a guide to walk ahead of us, and if you want to keep the hand grenade you can keep the hand grenade as long as you don't show</sentence><sentence id="1090">9 it, and then you can always blow yourself up if they catch you." (</sentence><sentence id="1091">Laughter) So, so, uh, I, I think this is a great... think...I thought this was a fantastic deal, and so uh they logged me in and they signed me up right away, you know...we are put you in and uh then let's hop in the hop in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1092">We mount the machine gun on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in case we run into Germans or Gardists...these were called like guardists, like they were called "Garda."</sentence><sentence id="1093">We go in into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where apparently there is a base being made and there is...it's full of soldiers and there's arms all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there's dynamite all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1094">I mean there was just just all the arms you wanted to see because the soldiers...this was...they vacated the <span class="BUILDING">garrisons</span>, took all the arms and they all and all all the ammo with them and I say well could I at least have a rifle, so we go this through this long negotiation.</sentence><sentence id="1095">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1096">You can have arifle.</sentence><sentence id="1097">And uh I sleep, get fed pork.</sentence><sentence id="1098">I really feel fantastic.</sentence><sentence id="1099">I mean...I'm, I'm really...1 mean this is a bunch of he-men.</sentence><sentence id="1100">I'm clearly the youngest guy.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Uh early in the afternoon somebody says well, do you know how to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="1102">I say I don't even know how to load the thing, so they take me out and they say this is what you do and they show me how to how to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="1103">In the morning uh this, this, this Russian comes.</sentence><sentence id="1104">His name is "Batko" ...everybody's only known by their first name...comes and say, "Well, we're going to go for a raid.</sentence><sentence id="1105">Uh we really have to find a <span class="DLF">rail line</span> that is close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> so we can really get ourselves lined up in here.</sentence><sentence id="1106">Uh we're taking you with us kid."</sentence><sentence id="1107">So I go...but no rifle...peasant clothing, just the hand grenade in your pocket, so I go on the first raid.</sentence><sentence id="1108">Now turns out that this was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me, because the army that fled and the communist government that got created, created actually an <span class="REGION">area</span>, a liberated area.</sentence><sentence id="1109">They declared it a Czechoslovak-liberated state.</sentence><sentence id="1110">It was a hundred by two hundred kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="1111">They decided to hold it until the Russians come.</sentence><sentence id="1112">Now this was in September.</sentence><sentence id="1113">This was another Warsaw Uprising, only on a much bigger scale and uh "Batko""s orders was never stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Never stay put.</sentence><sentence id="1115">Your job is not to fight Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1116">Your job is to mess <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> up.</sentence><sentence id="1117">Now I didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="1118">Now one of the grave misfortunes</sentence><sentence id="1120">0 of the other Jews were that they came in...this was a liberated area.</sentence><sentence id="1121">They joined the established environment.</sentence><sentence id="1122">Many of the Jews who had fled to that <span class="REGION">area</span>, and of course when the Germans cleaned it up by October 28th, everybody got annihilated and there are these hugh <span class="DLF">tank ditches</span> that people dug which are full of bodies.</sentence><sentence id="1123">You know, about eighty-five thousand people got killed in that that process.</sentence><sentence id="1124">So we go on the first raid I think on the 4th of September, and uh I like it.</sentence><sentence id="1125">I mean it is just great.</sentence><sentence id="1126">You know, here are the guys.</sentence><sentence id="1127">You know, there's eight of us, a machine gun, uh lots of ammo.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Uh there are guys who are carrying the TNT...that's what we used, uh TNT.</sentence><sentence id="1129">It's it's it's more powerful than than than dynamite but it's not like plastique, and these are little uh metal boxes about this big, this wide and uh it's a real charming group.</sentence><sentence id="1130">Uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commando squad</span> is a very unusual dynamics.</sentence><sentence id="1131">In other words, in no time everybody knows he is dependent on everybody, so I mean nobody says "I'm a Jew," or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I mean it's just, you know, "Hey, kid.</sentence><sentence id="1133">You know, you going to walk ahead of us, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1134">We we really need you."</sentence><sentence id="1135">And so I lead them through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh we go further north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136">See, below Tren_in the valley widens and the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> hugs the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> so it's about two, three kilometers away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1137">Once you go north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span>, you are in a narrow valley and the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> sort of snakes in and out and there are dozens of places where you can come fairly close to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> without being seen.</sentence><sentence id="1138">So I take them there.</sentence><sentence id="1139">They are very pleased uh with with that, and uh so we march during the day, ducking the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1140">Of course the peasants see us, but everybody turns around.</sentence><sentence id="1141">You know, they don't want to see us and uh we go...starts raining.</sentence><sentence id="1142">We come to the edge, edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> early in the evening and we are just going to sit there and wait.</sentence><sentence id="1143">I I'm not sure I know what's going on, but "Batko" obviously knows.</sentence><sentence id="1144">He must have done it dozens and dozens of times.</sentence><sentence id="1145">He sets up the machine gun so that if if uh the troops would come against us...the idea is to have a high ground.</sentence><sentence id="1146">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> is down, and we find, as I will show you later on a photograph, it's an <span class="DLF">embankment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1147">We sit at the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1148">There is an <span class="DLF">embankment</span> below us where we sit will sit up the machine gun and</sentence><sentence id="1150">1 then uh then a few of us will go to the <span class="DLF">track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1151">Uh as soon as it gets dark uh "Batko" uh says "OK, let's go to the <span class="DLF">track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1152">And why don't you come with us."</sentence><sentence id="1153">So three of us go down to the <span class="DLF">track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1154">Why he took me, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1155">We go to the <span class="DLF">track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1156">We lay the TNTs right on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And the the the trick is in demolition...this is not what you see in movies, John Wayne movies...there is no way how you can carry enough ammo to blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sky high.</sentence><sentence id="1158">To blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sky high you would have to be on a <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1159">You would have to know exactly where the bridge pins are.</sentence><sentence id="1160">The <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were usually in populated areas.</sentence><sentence id="1161">There was no way; and they were guarded and it was too risky.</sentence><sentence id="1162">The real trick is to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> derail itself.</sentence><sentence id="1163">The way how you do it is you find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">track</span> is slightly on a curve.</sentence><sentence id="1164">The way a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> runs is that the it has flanges, sort of...in other words, the way, the reason a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> doesn't derail is because the wheels are open on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but if pieces of steel going down so that the piece of steel always presses against the lip of the rail and the trick then is to blow up the heaviest part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, which is the tender.</sentence><sentence id="1165">In other words, the steam...these are steam <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> by the ways...the heaviest part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is where you have the water and the coal, which is usually about fifteen meters behind the front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1166">I mean, these are standard-sized <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> and the way "Batko" explains it all you have to do is knock out the rail under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tender</span>, the heavy part, and derail the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tender</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1167">The tender will tip over and pull the rest of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down from the <span class="DLF">embankment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1168">So you know, this is an art form.</sentence><sentence id="1169">So far as "Batko" is concerned, derailing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> is an art form.</sentence><sentence id="1170">The...and then he, of course, he is full of stories.</sentence><sentence id="1171">You know, as we sit there he tells me stories.</sentence><sentence id="1172">He is a very lively kind of a guy.</sentence><sentence id="1173">Uh again, the squad is eight people, three Russians and five Slovaks of whom four are communists (including one of them who fought in the Spanish civil war), so that's that's the squad and the guy who fought in the Spanish Civil War, it's it's a father and a son so there's father and son in the squad.</sentence><sentence id="1174">That's that's the makeup of the squad.</sentence><sentence id="1175">Get along very well.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And uh the idea then is to lay the TNT under the rail, connect a fuse so that when the first wheel of the steam engine comes and crushes the fuse it will ignite the</sentence><sentence id="1178">2 detonator.</sentence><sentence id="1179">OK?</sentence><sentence id="1180">And the detonator then will ignite a cord and the cord goes at the rate of one second every twenty centimeters, so that the speed of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is about forty miles an hour, thirty miles an hour, you need a cord approximately four feet long so that when the first wheel detonates the thing, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will have passed approximately fifteen meters and it will blow right under the wheel of the tender.</sentence><sentence id="1181">Again this is this is...now we're doing with professionals.</sentence><sentence id="1182">The problem with most of the partisans that existed and the stories that you hear about partisans...these were all amateurs.</sentence><sentence id="1183">This is this is this is killer stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1184">Highly specialized.</sentence><sentence id="1185">So uh we lay the TNT.</sentence><sentence id="1186">We lay the fuse, but we don't put the fuse on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span>, because we are going to do it only when we get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1187">We don't want to blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1188">Uh and so that's how we do it for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Uh we know by sound how this thing works.</sentence><sentence id="1190">Uh we can tell a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="1191">Batko" knows how to tell a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1192">We go back to the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> about midnight, maybe eleven o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="1193">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1194">By that time it rains.</sentence><sentence id="1195">The <span class="DLF">field</span> that is between the <span class="DLF">embankment</span>...you know, it's only about two hundred meters but it's a it's a soggy <span class="DLF">field</span> and uh between the <span class="DLF">field</span> there is a <span class="DLF">path</span> which is beaten but everything else has been plowed.</sentence><sentence id="1196">I mean this is September.</sentence><sentence id="1197">This is a <span class="DLF">wheat field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1198">It has been plowed, and "Batko" says, "You just make sure that you're in there where the <span class="DLF">path</span> is."</sentence><sentence id="1199">So we go back up.</sentence><sentence id="1200">When the uh when when "Batko" says, "I've seen we've got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span>," and we go back up on the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and we crouch against the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and we wait until we see the lights of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1201">You have to see the lights of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> because if the Germans have what's called a draisienne [NB: a handcar], which is a little <span class="DLF">platform</span> or a a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> ahead of it...they usually used to push a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>...later by the way they had hostages on the on the flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with them from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local villages</span> but this time they didn't...you want to make sure they don't blow up the uh flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And of course this was still early, and I don't think on the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the Germans expected anything.</sentence><sentence id="1203">You know, they used a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1204">This is the main <span class="DLF">rail line</span> between <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the way.</sentence><sentence id="1205">This is the <span class="DLF">train line</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span>, and the Germans did</sentence><sentence id="1207">3 not know whether the Russians are going to attack through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube Valley</span> or through the Vis_a[NB: Vistula] Valley, so those three <span class="DLF">lines</span> that were going north-south were critical to the ability of the Germans to shift troops back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="1208">They were running out of troops, out of out of troops and out of uh the ability to defend, so those three <span class="DLF">lines</span> were very dependent.</sentence><sentence id="1209">The Ukrainian command had four squads who had nothing else to do except keep those <span class="DLF">lines</span>, <span class="DLF">lines</span> harassed.</sentence><sentence id="1210">And by the way, when you blow up that <span class="DLF">line</span>, usually it gets cleared up in about a half'a day.</sentence><sentence id="1211">The the objective...Yah, I mean you cannot disable the <span class="DLF">line</span> unless you blow up a bri...a major <span class="DLF">bridge</span> which you couldn't do.</sentence><sentence id="1212">I mean the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were extremely well defended.</sentence><sentence id="1213">That's the first thing the Germans took care of.</sentence><sentence id="1214">All you can do is make it difficult for the Germans, make them go slow, uh divert arms, go into com... and and deploy troops to keep the <span class="DLF">lines</span> clear so you you really...it's a harassing act.</sentence><sentence id="1215">It's it's it's it's it's a bee bite.</sentence><sentence id="1216">It's not deadly stuff, but that's what guerrilla warfare is all about.</sentence><sentence id="1217">So so uh we have to wait until we see the lights of the of the uh of the of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and as we go back to arm this thing, uh "Batko," who is going to do that, hands over to me the detonators.</sentence><sentence id="1218">It's a box.</sentence><sentence id="1219">The the the detonators are ina box.</sentence><sentence id="1220">It's it's a sort of leather pouch.</sentence><sentence id="1221">These are little cartridges about this big.</sentence><sentence id="1222">It has uh fulminate of mercury.</sentence><sentence id="1223">If you hit it, it explodes.</sentence><sentence id="1224">It's...these are the igniters that you have in all ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And while he's fitting the fuse he holds, asks me to hold uh that leather box which is lined with cotton and has these detonators.</sentence><sentence id="1226">Now what I didn't know was that we had more TNT than we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">detonators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1227">We were short in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">detonators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1228">And so this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> keeps coming.</sentence><sentence id="1229">You see the lights and there is "Batko," you know, uh mounting this detonator on that fuse and I'm pretty cool and uh as I hand it to him I spill all the detonators right on the uh <span class="DLF">embankment</span>, which is made out of gravel and "Batko" says, "You better get those."</sentence><sentence id="1230">I mean...and and this this is serious stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1231">So...and he starts running off the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is coming.</sentence><sentence id="1232">I stand there on the <span class="DLF">embankment</span>, pick up the detonators, put them in my pocket, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1233">And when I picked up all the detona....by that time I have light from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1234">I just start running</sentence><sentence id="1236">4 down the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and I miss the, it's called the "medza"...the the little space between <span class="DLF">fields</span> where you can walk is called a "medza."</sentence><sentence id="1237">And uh I miss it, so I hit the plowed wet <span class="DLF">field</span>, which is really a potfull of mud and I just uh go, you know, maybe uh twenty feet or something and then I see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sort of chugging and I look over my shoulder and I say, "Well, this is just about when it's going to blow."</sentence><sentence id="1238">I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> blows.</sentence><sentence id="1239">And you could see the front end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the engine slowly....it's like slow motion...it sort of...it's it's funny, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1240">I could see it like today.</sentence><sentence id="1241">It just blows and then slowly starts going off the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and then pulls the front <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1242">The front <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> on it.</sentence><sentence id="1243">I mean it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop train</span>, and in the middle was...the Germans had uh uh you know machine gun nests and you hear, pop...it's there what you call flares, and the way a flare works, a flare gun...it's a big barrel gun.</sentence><sentence id="1244">It's a rocket.</sentence><sentence id="1245">You hear the pop.</sentence><sentence id="1246">It's like on Fourth of July.</sentence><sentence id="1247">You always hear the ignition and the take-off and it only ignites when it gets up on the top.</sentence><sentence id="1248">So I stay on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1249">You know, I I hear, I feel the hot stuff uh from the from the steam escaping from the from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the iron's flying around but didn't hit me, and there I see a white light coming down.</sentence><sentence id="1250">They've shot it over very far, and of course "Batko" by that time was scrambling up the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and so they started shooting at him.</sentence><sentence id="1251">Didn't hit him.</sentence><sentence id="1252">So as soon as the flare dies out, I start running down the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1253">Now maybe the Germans had only one flare gun, or maybe the guy who's shooting the flare gun was very slow, but the the uh you know there were intervals, enough intervals between the uh flare guns that I could always...when I hear a pop I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and waited, and of course they were raking with machine gun fire with tracers over the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1254">They didn't know what they were shooting at.</sentence><sentence id="1255">Uh they didn't see that there was an <span class="DLF">embankment</span> actually going up.</sentence><sentence id="1256">They were just sort of raking at eye level.</sentence><sentence id="1257">And I made it up the <span class="DLF">embankment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1258">You know, it's it's...you will see from the picture...it's it's not a big distance but it's an interminable distance under fire.</sentence><sentence id="1259">And uh uh our guys didn't shoot back.</sentence><sentence id="1260">It it...our guys were going to shoot back only, because then you reveal your fire and then you draw fire.</sentence><sentence id="1261">You only shoot when you see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troops</span></sentence><sentence id="1263">5 dismounting and pursuing.</sentence><sentence id="1264">Yeah, you only shoot against...I mean these were professionals.</sentence><sentence id="1265">I mean amateurs would have popped their guns, you know, started shooting willy nilly and then the Germans would have shooted willy nilly, and but these were really professionals, particularly the guy from the Spanish civil war.</sentence><sentence id="1266">This was a cool cucumber.</sentence><sentence id="1267">I mean this guy was an absolute professional killer.</sentence><sentence id="1268">Uh by the way, this guy after the war became the uh head of a trial.</sentence><sentence id="1269">He was the head judge that hanged Tiso.</sentence><sentence id="1270">He was the...he became a judge.</sentence><sentence id="1271">This this one judge you wouldn't want to come in front of.</sentence><sentence id="1272">At any rate, a great guy.</sentence><sentence id="1273">So I get up the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and they were lying down there.</sentence><sentence id="1274">They were waiting for me.</sentence><sentence id="1275">One one of the things in a commando squad is, in a professional commando squad, you don't let your guys hang around.</sentence><sentence id="1276">Now if they get wounded, you shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="1277">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1278">Because you don't want them to fall into enemy hands, but but there's a funny ethic in a in that kind of attack, that that you really protect your people.</sentence><sentence id="1279">You don't have that many and so they said OK, you made it.</sentence><sentence id="1280">Did OK.</sentence><sentence id="1281">So then we go up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and and uh we uh we stop and uh at a little <span class="DLF">clearing</span> and of course we hear the crackle from there and the Germans are firing firing wildly but it's dark, it's raining, so you know, the the bullets are not even coming close to us.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And uh "Batko" says "OK, now let's regroup."</sentence><sentence id="1283">He pulls out his pistol and points it at me..."You lost our caps.</sentence><sentence id="1284">We cannot go on another raid.</sentence><sentence id="1285">You lost my caps.</sentence><sentence id="1286">That's punish...punishable.</sentence><sentence id="1287">You know, we're going to shoot you, you Jew kid!"</sentence><sentence id="1288">you know.</sentence><sentence id="1289">And I said, "Well, what do you mean?</sentence><sentence id="1290">I got them."</sentence><sentence id="1291">And I go in my pocket and I pulled the detonators out of my pocket and everybody sort of goes to the side (laughter). "</sentence><sentence id="1292">This kid"... mean, "how did you make it because you know, if you would have hit it...I mean if you hit it like that, you would have blown" ...apparently I was totally oblivious to it but the mud was so soft that whenever I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>...I mean it would have tore off my leg.</sentence><sentence id="1293">So this "Batko" says, "Boy, are you lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1294">You are so lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1295">We we're going to put you right into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">squad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1296">We need a little luck," so so I became as a result of that uh the member of the squad and uh then they took me back and they trained me how to do it,</sentence><sentence id="1298">6 and uh then I did a number of raids with them.</sentence><sentence id="1299">Uh "Batko" was sort of a braggart.</sentence><sentence id="1300">I mean he was a real braggart and one day we were just mov...coming back from a raid and we were very tired. "</sentence><sentence id="1301">Batko" says, "I'm not going to slug through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>," because we used to go off the <span class="DLF">paths</span> and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1302">This was al... already in October.</sentence><sentence id="1303">Things were getting pretty tough and the German patrols were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and he said, "We are we are just going to go on the <span class="DLF">road</span>," and we said, you know, "You can't do that." "</sentence><sentence id="1304">Oh, we're going to go down the <span class="DLF">road</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1305">So we say, "Well, we're going going to walk in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span>," because I mean to walk in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> during the day it was, it was insane.</sentence><sentence id="1306">He says, "I'm just too tired to to slug through the <span class="DLF">ditch</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1307">Again, it was raining and sloshing and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="1308">So we walked down the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and suddenly a German patrol came up.</sentence><sentence id="1309">They had a machine gun and this crazy "Batko" stood in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> with his uh PTS, which is this this Russian uh automatic with the seventeen...it looks like gangster...it's a knock-off of a Al Capone gun.</sentence><sentence id="1310">And he stands in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the...you know...that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol truck</span> with a machine gun on top, stands there and shoots...stands...he doesn't, didn't budge.</sentence><sentence id="1311">You know, we were in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1312">And he just stands and they just cut him down.</sentence><sentence id="1313">He was going to get that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1314">So we lost him, and after that the squad just didn't have luck.</sentence><sentence id="1315">I mean, we just...the other two Russians were not very good.</sentence><sentence id="1316">Uh, I, I don't know why, but, but, but just the luck ran out of it and then, uh, on November 2nd, uh, we had the misfortune to get mixed up in a fight that we really didn't belong to.</sentence><sentence id="1317">Uh, the Germans always tried to move the partisans that were remaining.</sentence><sentence id="1318">By, you know, by the 28th they cleaned up the fixed <span class="NPIP">position</span>, they destroyed the army, the soldiers were fighting with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1319">The Jews...there was a two hundred-man Jewish brigade from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> who was given on open <span class="DLF">field</span> the job of holding the <span class="DLF">line</span> for retreating soldiers ... against advancing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1320">I mean total slaughter, and then the Germans had Ukrainians Sonderkommandos, not German, to go after the remainder of the troops...uh you know, just driving us up into little <span class="REGION">enclaves</span>, surrounding us and then just wiping us out because these were extremely skilled anti-guerrilla uh operations.</sentence><sentence id="1323">7 I mean these were professional operations for uh getting rid of guerrillas.</sentence><sentence id="1324">I mean there's there's are whole ways how you go after guerrillas.</sentence><sentence id="1325">And uh I think that the the two Russians sort of wanted to to to sort of keep with others because of food or whatever and so in November we got uh we joined a bigger group because we were going to move our base and we got caught, surrounded on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1326">I mean there was snow by that time.</sentence><sentence id="1327">It was snowing by that time.</sentence><sentence id="1328">You know, it was like a foot of snow and uh they drove us on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> which had the...was surrounded on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> with a with a <span class="DLF">road</span> and uh they were just firing uh uh shrapnel all day into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1329">We were taking heavy, heavy casualties.</sentence><sentence id="1330">You see, in those days when you took a...when you were wounded, you were...you might as well shoot yourself and so uh they were shooting at us all day and then during the night they went after us, which was very unusual, and the way they went after us, they pretended that they were Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1331">These were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vlasov</span> ...these were the Vlasov guys, and so I got separated in November from the, from the squad.</sentence><sentence id="1332">That night uh I and another guy from the squad, who by the way was a criminal.</sentence><sentence id="1333">You know, the the makeup of of this group was...got more and more unsavory as time went on, and as we were on the ridge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and we just rolled down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and uh we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1334">Now this was November...<span class="ENV_FEATURES">iced river</span>, all slippery, in snow, and we waded the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and uh we escaped the the uh surrounding, but everybody else was involved got either captured, or shot, or killed.</sentence><sentence id="1335">Uh I think there must have been something like two hundred partisans on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1336">I think only about twenty, thirty got away, and uh soaking wet uh we started marching east.</sentence><sentence id="1337">By that time we decided we are going to just move towards the front, and uh then I joined another brigade and then starting in December we started slowly fighting our way east.</sentence><sentence id="1338">I only went on one more raid in January, and by that time I had pleurisy and I was bleeding and...I was...after February I didn't fight anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1339">I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1340">I mean just could hardly walk.</sentence><sentence id="1341">Uh I crossed the <span class="DLF">lines</span> about uh four hundred kilometers east of where I joined the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1342">In other words, we started walking towards the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>, and we finally</sentence><sentence id="1344">8 crossed the <span class="DLF">line</span> on March 25th, 1944 [NB: This must be 1945, since he joined the partisans in Sept. 1944], so I joined the partisans on the 4th of September and joined the Czechoslovak army...it turned out when we crossed the front we ran into the Czechoslovak brigade.</sentence><sentence id="1345">It was coming out of Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1346">Uh the Russians immediately got separated from us because they were all suspect of being collaborators, using the partisans purely as being a cover for them and there was quite a bit of that so they...all the Russians immediately the moment we crossed the front immediately went for interrogation by the NK VD.</sentence><sentence id="1347">Uh early in uh March we also picked up five Americans fliers who were wandering through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> who uh who had been shot down and who who just stayed with the partisans, although they refused...this was a very peculiar thing...they refused to carry arms because they were protected by the Geneva Convention if they didn't carry arms and you know, we told them..."Look, you guys,...[ mean I mean, you're not going to enter a long debate with, with, with the Sonderkommando when they catch you."</sentence><sentence id="1348">No, they didn't want to carry arms.</sentence><sentence id="1349">Uh we also picked up an agent from the British ISA uh OSS.</sentence><sentence id="1350">The misfortune of that guy was that apparently he was carrying quite a bit of cash and gold on him.</sentence><sentence id="1351">He was dropped that way and uh the Russians accused him of being a spy and they shot him.</sentence><sentence id="1352">I mean there's some really ghastly stories I could tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1353">I mean pretty ghastly stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1354">But I didn't get wounded.</sentence><sentence id="1355">I was just just totally, you know, physically and mentally worn out and had abscesses and sores all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1356">I mean a real sorry state.</sentence><sentence id="1357">I think I must have weighed, and lost, less than a hundred pounds when I crossed the <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1358">I got immediately picked up uh by the Czechoslovaks and they shipped me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> during the month of April.</sentence><sentence id="1359">Uh I had all the food...I mean just couldn't have enough food.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And uh on the 20th of April, I volunteered to to the Czechoslovak army to go back to the front, so then I uh was inducted in, back into the regular army and uh as we went through the induction period, you know, suddenly there is a colonel there and he said, "You know, you have this unbelievable military record here.</sentence><sentence id="1361">Uh we need you in uh really in a special</sentence><sentence id="1363">9 assignment.</sentence><sentence id="1364">We are going to send you to <span class="BUILDING">officer school</span>," and I said, you know, "But the war will be over!",</sentence><sentence
