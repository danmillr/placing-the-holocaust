<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Now, prior to 1939, what did you know about Hitler and Nazis and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, we knew enough.</sentence><sentence id="160">We had a radio, of course.</sentence><sentence id="161">The radio at that time was still pretty new, but we had a radio.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I remember very clearly as we were listening -- my mother was still living at that time -- I think it was in April of "34 where the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was shot.</sentence><sentence id="163">His name was Schuslig (ph), I think.</sentence><sentence id="164">I remember that and we were quite shocked because there was already a from Hitler's party because he wanted to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and so, it wasn't good for -- it was how they killed him.</sentence><sentence id="165">And the new president .</sentence><sentence id="166">So, we knew about Crystal Nacht (ph), in 1938, we heard that over the radio.</sentence><sentence id="167">And it bothered us, but still, nobody comprehend, nobody could foresee that would happen.</sentence><sentence id="168">We were pretty edgy about it, but we still took the attitude, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> is a free, beautiful, democratic country and we didn't worry much about it.</sentence><sentence id="169">I'm afraid so, in 1939, before <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> Republic was born, March 14 in "39, my father got papers to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span>, to immigrate.</sentence><sentence id="170">It was official and he could have given the paper right away.</sentence><sentence id="171">But my grandmother was still living , and my mother was already dead, and we didn't see that we could go away and leave her behind.</sentence><sentence id="172">So we figured, we'll ditch these papers to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">And we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="174">And I was still in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">As I say, I finished -- the last year the Jews could graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, from <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">It was on June 6, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="177">Of course, I always USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 3 wanted to be a doctor and I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, but I was cut out.</sentence><sentence id="178">No Jew could enter <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">So, what to do, then?</sentence><sentence id="180">I was 18 years old.</sentence><sentence id="181">So, I went to work for my father in his electrical undertaking and I learned electrical work.</sentence><sentence id="182">And I was, it seemed, from 19 -- to the end of the war -- 1945.</sentence><sentence id="183">Although in 1944, we already went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> to escape, but we will come to it.</sentence><sentence id="184">But I was working, helping out, and I learned the trade.</sentence><sentence id="185">And about the business.</sentence><sentence id="186">Soon, the Slovak regime started.</sentence><sentence id="187">My father had to give up the business and he had to be political party zealot (ph).</sentence><sentence id="188">An Audian (ph) person, had to take over.</sentence><sentence id="189">He was the boss.</sentence><sentence id="190">He took the money.</sentence><sentence id="191">And just give certain amount of income to my father to live on.</sentence><sentence id="192">That was from 19 -- if | remember, it may be from 1941 or so to end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="193">So my father was employed, I was employed, but we stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">We did not go.</sentence><sentence id="195">Now, my sister, she was a seamstress.</sentence><sentence id="196">She was very good at it.</sentence><sentence id="197">And she worked for a <span class="BUILDING">Slovak company</span> at a <span class="BUILDING">job</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">By 1942, came an order, actually, a letter given to the Jewish families, which said that all girls from age, I know it was from 16 or 18, unmarried women, should report in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, I think, if I remember right, either five or ten kilograms of supply and they would be taken to a <span class="BUILDING">working place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">So all the girls from, not all the girls, there were some exceptions, but many of the girls came.</sentence><sentence id="200">They had about two weeks notice.</sentence><sentence id="201">But at that time, you didn't know yet what was happening, so nobody felt nothing bad about it.</sentence><sentence id="202">They came there and stayed overnight in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">And the next day, they were taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poprat</span> (ph), which is about 40 kilometers east, and from there, on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">Now, we didn't know nothing.</sentence><sentence id="205">We knew nothing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="206">Now, there were some parents who were a little bit smarter than we were.</sentence><sentence id="207">And when they got the notice, they send their daughters to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for appendectomy, whether they needed it or not, and they saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="208">As a matter of fact, my classmate, girlfriend, who saved her life, lives here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">She's married here to an American boy.</sentence><sentence id="210">But my father,we tried to talk, I must say, my sister was very good friend with a girl who was a, she was a girlfriend of the chief of the " was an organization which cooperated, of course, with Hitler, and which took care of all the Jewish problems.</sentence><sentence id="211">And my father went to this -- to help this girl to beg that they shouldn't take my sister.</sentence><sentence id="212">But they did not worry about it -- just didn't want to talk to my father about it.</sentence><sentence id="213">And that was our goal -- that was our biggest mistake that we made because they left of March 27, 1942, from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nicholage</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="214">And on April the 2nd, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took them from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poprat</span> (ph) to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">We never heard of her anymore.</sentence><sentence id="216">And we found out that in May or June, they were already liquidated .</sentence><sentence id="217">So as I said, that was our biggest tragedy in the family.</sentence><sentence id="218">But we stayed on.</sentence><sentence id="219">And the tragedy was also that two weeks after she was deported, my father got so-called economic exemption.</sentence><sentence id="220">That means that father, my stepmother, I and my brother, we didn't even have to wear the , the Star.</sentence><sentence id="221">We didn't have to wear it.</sentence><sentence id="222">We could travel, but the condition was we needed to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by 6:00 at night.</sentence><sentence id="223">We couldn't go to a movie.</sentence><sentence id="224">We couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have a radio.</sentence><sentence id="225">If the family had a radio, it was a big punishment for that.</sentence><sentence id="226">And actually, we worked, and my father worked, uninterrupted, until the uprising took in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, which was August 29, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="227">The uprising took place in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called , which was maybe 50 or 60 kilometers away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">There were some politicists, landing down (ph), some from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, some from the brigade.</sentence><sentence id="229">They picked out a few men and they were coming towards my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and quite a few army people.</sentence><sentence id="230">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, there was a <span class="BUILDING">German station</span> of about 10 or USHMM Archives RG-50.030*00327 4 12 men who managed a <span class="BUILDING">telegraph station</span> for .</sentence><sentence id="231">This partisan and the army came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, that was in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">They surprised these men.</sentence><sentence id="233">They shot them all. .</sentence><sentence id="234">It was the president of -- for their interruptions.</sentence><sentence id="235">The front didn't have any more connections to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">Because we knew that if something had happened, that there would be murder.</sentence><sentence id="237">I mean, everybody would be killed because there was, you know, the Germans might (ph) kill them.</sentence><sentence id="238">So, we didn't know, of course, at least, something bad had happened, but we were preparing ourselves for bad times, to leave our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, because Nicholage (ph), my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> lies right on the top of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">So, about a year before, we found a carpenter who was not a sympathizer with the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="240">He was acommunist.</sentence><sentence id="241">And he built us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, about three kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">Please ask me if you have a question.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: I'm curious what happened between 1938 and 1942.</sentence><sentence id="336">That's a big chunk of time, considering what was happening in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="337">So, what was happening in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

"</sentence><sentence id="367">You will go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">You will help the government to survive.</sentence><sentence id="369">And you'll be fed.</sentence><sentence id="370">And you'll even get -- everything will be fine."</sentence><sentence id="371">Did I say that time when my sister was taken in "42?</sentence><sentence id="372"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.030*00327 5</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: You said "42.</sentence><sentence id="407">Was there any German presence?</sentence><sentence id="408">Or everything was controlled by the Slovakian government?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: There was Slovakian government, but there were <span class="BUILDING">German offices</span> in the capital city of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">There was a person, a German person called , who was the ambassador there.</sentence><sentence id="414">And of course, he gave the instructions what should be done.</sentence><sentence id="415">But locally, there were some Nazi party Youth organizations, such as Euchre (ph), but officially, everything was controlled by the Slovak.</sentence><sentence id="416">But the hundred or so were German.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="432">A: You're right.</sentence><sentence id="433">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="436">Q: What happened to those friends afterwards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
