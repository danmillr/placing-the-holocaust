<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: I never knew any difference, so I really, when people talk about anti-Semitism and this and that, I don't -- I didn't -- I didn't feel any, you know, except once in awhile or -- later on the Polish -- the teach -- teacher of Polish would say, you don't say it's -- it's a st -- it stands in a -- it stands in a newspaper, that's a German expression, which of course you pick it up from if they were talking Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know, th-they tranpor -- transported that into Polish, and that -- that's the only thing I remember the teacher says, that he says don't say that because that's not good Polish, and that was the only thing.</sentence><sentence id="242">But I--I didn't see any difference, I mean,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="245">I played with them and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with them and -- and I did even a sinful thing because sometimes we would feed them ham sandwiches, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: How would you describe yourself as a child?</sentence><sentence id="247">Were you outgoing, or were you quiet?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Oh, I was very outgoing and very curious.</sentence><sentence id="249">Any [indecipherable] that did -- I was always very inquisitive, why is it so, and a -- and -- and -- and how it could -- it -- how is it that is so and so.</sentence><sentence id="250">And it was in the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that -- I don't know what grade he was, but anyhow, the -- there was a time when the ve -- Viennese Jews came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">And of course they were very rich and brought their stuff and bought <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and all that, and -- but the kids had to come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with us.</sentence><sentence id="252">And a -- they didn't sp -- when they -- the parents always spoke German, but the kids would answer them in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="253">And -- but there was this one who, well I think we were just so jealous of her because she was big and -- and she had a maid who carried her satchel to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="254">But of course she was so heavy that she couldn't carry all this stuff.</sentence><sentence id="255">And there were four of us going along the side -- in the -- Beniki(ph) there was this -- this close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula river</span>, so there's this part where you walk, but -- but then it comes down.</sentence><sentence id="256">Not in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span>, but it just -- and the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> lowers a little bit towards the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">And low -- we all -- there were four friends of us, and we all wish we'd got together, and so whenever this girl and the maid would come, we wouldn't let her through.</sentence><sentence id="258">And one day, I don't know why, one of us, some newcomer came and she -- sh-she joined the</sentence><sentence id="260">group and it came so that we pushed this other gir -- not the girl, but the maid fell down.</sentence><sentence id="261">And so she went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she complained that we are misbehaving and all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal called us in, and then the teacher said -- cause she went to the principal and then the principal told the teacher that -- what kind of children she's bringing up.</sentence><sentence id="262">Course, that was a Class of 40 kids, so she couldn't really watch over everyone.</sentence><sentence id="263">But she says to us, why did you push them, or did you push her?</sentence><sentence id="264">And somebody says, because she is a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="265">And the teacher said, uh-uh, then you would push Holy Mary in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="266">No, never.</sentence><sentence id="267">How would we?</sentence><sentence id="268">She said, oh yes you would, and you would put Jesus in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="269">And we said why?</sentence><sentence id="270">She says, because they were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="271">And of course, nobody ever told us that, you know, you always talk about all this other stuff.</sentence><sentence id="272">And we had a <span class="BUILDING">religion class</span> every day, so the Jewish girls went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, th-they had a free period, and then on -- when they had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I think on Sunday they had their <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, so for religion they went to their own rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="273">And so there was -- Thad an afet -- uncle who was an atheist, and he all -- and this preacher -- I mean, this religion teacher always says, any questions?</sentence><sentence id="274">And this uncle of mine always would ask -- say ask him about this and that, and there were all kinds of questions, you know, that a priest couldn't really answer to s -- little children.</sentence><sentence id="275">And so this day, it-- I'm just keep on, you know, telling him [indecipherable] when he said, are there any questions, I say, yeah, yeah, he -- but he just want -- disregarded me, because he</sentence><sentence id="277">didn't want any stupid questions again.</sentence><sentence id="278">But I almost knock his glasses off, and I say --so he says okay, now what is it today?</sentence><sentence id="279">And I say, is this true that J-Jesus was a Jew?</sentence><sentence id="280">And he say, yeah, and his mother and his apostles and the first Christians were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="281">And then I say, how come we never knew about it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="282">But anyhow, I think that from that moment on, mine attitude toward Jews was changed.</sentence><sentence id="283">You know there was that, before when I -- when I looked -- course, you couldn't tell who was a Jew if they were not having the itzkeys(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the mitzkeys(ph) on top, or howarts(ph) with all this stuff, you couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="284">But then since that time I keep looking, you know, whether I -- cause there was this stupid idea that I recognize Jesus in one of them, but I mean -- anyhow, that's how my attitude -- I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, okay, and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends don't talk about religion.</sentence><sentence id="285">You talk about your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> things, and your girl things and you don't talk about big things.</sentence><sentence id="286">But since then I--I was more friendly, and how would I say?</sentence><sentence id="287">Yeah, more interested, you know.</sentence><sentence id="288">And so then when I was [indecipherable] my best friend was Sarah Feldman and they lived on the corner there.</sentence><sentence id="289">By the way in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that the pope used to live as a little boy.</sentence><sentence id="290">And that was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">W-We live on this corner, on the <span class="BUILDING">Debieniczka(ph) market</span>, and on the other one, Sarah Feldman live in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and here's some <span class="NPIP">place</span> lived the present pope as a young boy.</sentence><sentence id="292">And Sarah was telling me something about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diaspora</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="293">Course, it wasn't</sentence><sentence id="295">called Diaspora in those days, but she says [indecipherable] Jew, and I just didn't believe her, you know.</sentence><sentence id="296">I always thought there -- I thought this old par -- Polish Jews were -- there were no Jews anyplace else but in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">Especially then, when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, we are no longer -- we are asked never to call them Jews, but Poles of Mosaic confession -- or persuasion, pardon me.</sentence><sentence id="298">Because my te -- now my teacher said, this word Jews is a word that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and it was an insulting word.</sentence><sentence id="299">And that's where you to -- when we -- we shouldn't be using it.</sentence><sentence id="300">And -- but then, you know how when you says Pole of a Mosaic persuasion, how long that is, your mouth, you -- to say she is -- and we never said she is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="301">I don't know, maybe we did.</sentence><sentence id="302">No [indecipherable] and we always says in the Jewish she or he, because in Polish that's possible.</sentence><sentence id="303">And anyhow, that's how I was brought up.</sentence><sentence id="304">You know, even today when I do the translations for the Red Cross and it says of nationality Polish, and religion, I always say Mosaic, because I -- I had to -- and they always would put -- tho-those who correct those things said Jewish, and I said no, so I wrote j -- the Polish Red Cross and I said, now what is it?</sentence><sentence id="305">Because when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, in [indecipherable] documents, it said confession, it says either Roman Catholic or Evangelic or whatever, or Mosaic.</sentence><sentence id="306">I mean, there was no such a thing like Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="307">So --and besides I say to this lady in the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>, that's an insult.</sentence><sentence id="308">And [indecipherable] Jews used an insulting words where it's possible, you know.</sentence><sentence id="309">And -- because they didn't know any different.</sentence><sentence id="310">But anyhow, so that's how -- if you have</sentence><sentence id="312">friends -- and this also played -- how to say, not -- I don't know, of course, in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> too, we had girls who were Jewish, and one of my -- I was one Eva, and the other one al -- Eva Kliseberg(ph).</sentence><sentence
