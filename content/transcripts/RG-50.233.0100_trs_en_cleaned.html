<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1365">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1366">So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name.</sentence><sentence id="1367">Theirs was a Russian name, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="1368">I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs ended in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kvov</span> which son of whatever as does ski, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1369">In any case, so I was --well, it's irrelevant, okay, I won't give you all that.</sentence><sentence id="1370">In any case, this woman had five children.</sentence><sentence id="1371">The oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn't take too terribly well to education.</sentence><sentence id="1372">I don't think he was ever sent <span class="NPIP">abroad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1373">He was sort of more interested in farming.</sentence><sentence id="1374">He was very practical, he was the farmer.</sentence><sentence

peasant.</sentence><sentence id="1377">He was very well liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1378">Then there was a middle son and he was very rebellious.</sentence><sentence id="1379">He ultimately ran off to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and was with the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1380">In fact, I used to hide out by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> when the Germans came.</sentence><sentence id="1381">At one point, I was hidden in the <span class="DLF">hayloft</span>, haystack rather.</sentence><sentence id="1382">He once or twice came and gave me messages which I carried back.</sentence><sentence id="1383">But I hardly remember him because he left.</sentence><sentence id="1384">I don't even remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="1385">I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to someone, and she said, and it's funny because it's an expression that I've used many times because it described him so well, it described his nature.</sentence><sentence id="1386">She said that this middle son when he has a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood.</sentence><sentence id="1387">I don't know whether that was a Russian saying but I've heard myself saying that in describing such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person.</sentence><sentence id="1388">The youngest son was two years older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="1389">His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1390">I was, I don't know, five and a half, six; he was two years older.</sentence><sentence id="1391">I can describe him

the same direction.</sentence><sentence id="1398">So he has this Russian version of a crew cut.</sentence><sentence id="1399">So those were the three sons.</sentence><sentence id="1400">The two daughters were Rya, who I've already told you about and the older one whose name I really don't remember and whom I didn't get to know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1401">So she had some sort of <span class="BUILDING">office</span> type job.</sentence><sentence id="1402">Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, the provider and the man about the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1403">Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the middle boy was the rebellious, I don't know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the partisans and became what we called a Cossack.</sentence><sentence id="1404">So that was the <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1405">Now I was not received with any degree of love or kindness.</sentence><sentence id="1406">I wasn't sheltered or shielded or loved at all.</sentence><sentence id="1407">I was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never with love.</sentence><sentence id="1408">I was never complimented.</sentence><sentence id="1409">If1I did something very well, it was -- more than anything I had the feeling of resentment.</sentence><sentence id="1410">Furthermore, I was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1411">I was urbane and Vali was a peasant.</sentence><sentence id="1412">He had never been to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1413">I described the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which I lived which had four floors.</sentence><sentence id="1414">He couldn't understand that there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> above a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1415">| explained to him that it was like the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one <span class="NPIP">end</span> to another -- and stored things.</sentence><sentence id="1416">Also like the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in fact, his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had three floors.</sentence><sentence id="1417">But these were four <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> of one above the other, <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and, you know, <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">I described one <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1419">He couldn't conceive of such a thing.</sentence><sentence id="1420">He couldn't conceive of such a thing as chocolate either.</sentence><sentence id="1421">So that when we were finally</sentence><sentence id="1423">invaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="1424">But then they went back and forth and in and out.</sentence><sentence id="1425">They were, you know, driven out by the Russians and there was fighting back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="1426">So they were there several times, in and out.</sentence><sentence id="1427">At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers.</sentence><sentence id="1428">They would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate.</sentence><sentence id="1429">I would then take the chocolate and give it to Vali.</sentence><sentence id="1430">Until the mother found out about this and put a stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely life threatening.</sentence><sentence id="1431">Well, anyway I never really had any love.</sentence><sentence id="1432">I was incredibly lonely.</sentence><sentence id="1433">I kept thinking about my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1434">One day, it just occurred to me that she's not living and she'l never come back.</sentence><sentence id="1435">Meanwhile the mother, Vali's mother, Rya's mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl.</sentence><sentence id="1436">Taught me all the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit although it was very difficult because of the primitive style of cooking in deep ovens with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron pots</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1437">You know, children couldn't physically manage that but everyone had jobs and mine was peeling the potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1438">In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled ten truckloads of potatoes, that's all I did.</sentence><sentence id="1439">I peeled potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1440">I read with the mother and at first she would read to me.</sentence><sentence id="1441">She read me Bible stories.</sentence><sentence id="1442">She would read to me and she would point to the words with her finger.</sentence><sentence id="1443">I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would turn the page and there would be a picture that related to the story.</sentence><sentence id="1444">She would continue the story and I kind of fell in love with one story.</sentence><sentence id="1445">I kept asking her to read it over and over.</sentence><sentence id="1446">It was the story of the prodigal son.</sentence><sentence id="1447">I don't know why I liked that one especially but somehow... So she read it over and over and then one day in the middle of the story, she sort of looked up and she said, you read, and I did.</sentence><sentence id="1448">And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so many times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story.</sentence><sentence id="1449">At one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls crossing a little <span class="DLF">bridge</span> over a -- you know -- like a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1450">Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water underneath.</sentence><sentence id="1451">Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with beautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown.</sentence><sentence id="1452">I said what is that and she explained to me about <span class="NPIP">angels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1453">I said everybody has an angel?</sentence><sentence id="1454">She said every child has an angel to protect it.</sentence><sentence id="1455">I said even Jewish children?</sentence><sentence id="1456">She said yes, even Jewish children and even you.</sentence><sentence id="1457">You have a very special angel.</sentence><sentence id="1458">So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was.</sentence><sentence id="1459">I was absolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because I had a Jewish angel.</sentence><sentence id="1460">No harm would come to me.</sentence><sentence id="1461">I knew that I would be all right.</sentence><sentence id="1462">I can tell you a lot of stories about life in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I was there two Christmases and three Easters or maybe the other way around.</sentence><sentence id="1464">It's the other way around.</sentence><sentence id="1465">One day, you're not going to believe this, you're not going to believe this...
