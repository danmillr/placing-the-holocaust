<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: Was your being Jewish a factor in volunteering?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="385">A: Very little.</sentence><sentence id="386">And it all goes back to my mother who kept drumming my being Yiddish, my being Jewish, over and over and over again until I just couldn't take any more.</sentence><sentence id="387">So I tried to be as -- not that I tried to be a goy, but I tried to be as non-Jewish as I could possibly be.</sentence><sentence id="388">And I got along with most everybody.</sentence><sentence id="389">I never suffered any real discrimination, although some of the boys who were in my outfit were religious and they took Fridays off and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="390">And they were discriminated against, not me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: Had you talked in detail with your parents about what was happening -- this is before you were drafted -- about what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: What <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> were you in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: 628th Light Equipment Engineers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="481">Q: Of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="483">A: Well, we were switched from army to army because we were a small outfit, about 100 men.</sentence><sentence id="484">And we worked the shovels and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">road graders</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span>, and so on, clearing <span class="DLF">roads</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="485">We were doing that in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="486">And we were moved from the -- we originally went over, I think it was the First Army.</sentence><sentence id="487">And then we were transferred as we went down to the Third Army.</sentence><sentence id="488">And then in Europe, I think we wound up with the Seventh Army.</sentence><sentence id="489">I'm not quite sure of these details.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: And now you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span>, waiting for the invasion.</sentence><sentence id="500">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> I guess it must have been about a month until the invasion.</sentence><sentence id="501">And we went over about D-plus 10, 12, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="502">D-Day plus 10.</sentence><sentence id="503">I wasn't part of the initial invasion.</sentence><sentence id="504">But it was a little harrowing.</sentence><sentence id="505">And we got stuck on a <span class="DLF">sand bar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">And finally they got us off and they were bombing us and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="507">From there, we landed on <span class="DLF">Utah Beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="508">I didn't even remember the <span class="DLF">beach</span> until I sort of looked it up for my company.</sentence><sentence id="509"><span class="DLF">Utah Beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="510">And then from there, we sort of went inland through the <span class="DLF">hedgerows</span> and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="523">Q: At this point, did you know anything about what was happening to the Jews or did you know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in general?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="525">A: Absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="526">We were so busy embroiled in what we were doing because we were under fire here and there, bombardments and so on.</sentence><sentence id="527">And I didn't have time to worry about anybody else but myself, actually.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1302">A: Well, it didn't quite hit me at that time, only because going through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the invasion and everything, I had seen a lot of bodies.</sentence><sentence id="1303">This was a terrible, terrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And then of course we realized that they were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1305">We felt a little bad.</sentence><sentence id="1306">But you must understand that it doesn't hit you suddenly.</sentence><sentence id="1307">You're looking and you say "That's a terrible thing."</sentence><sentence id="1308">And then you go on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1309">It's only after visiting there, after being away from there that I began to realize.</sentence><sentence id="1310">And it was only after I spoke to some girls who told me what they had gone through that I began to realize that this is true.</sentence><sentence id="1311">This is a holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1312">And it gradually over a period of time began to sink in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1324">Q: Did you have any trouble sleeping that night after you saw these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sites</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1326">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1327">Peculiar thing to say, I had no trouble at all.</sentence><sentence id="1328">Because remember when you're in the service you're worrying about your own being, and nothing is important as taking care of yourself.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And I felt badly.</sentence><sentence id="1330">I can't say that it just passed over me.</sentence><sentence id="1331">We started to talk about it, some of the boys and us, and then we began to realize how terrible a thing it was.</sentence><sentence id="1332">That's why when I see people who are not Jewish or people who don't care, they can't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1333">And I can understand why they can't believe it because it's too much to believe.</sentence><sentence id="1334">It's too much to take in at once.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1344">Q: Did you feel any kind of kinship with the Jewish prisoners?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: Always.</sentence><sentence id="1347">Because I met Jews throughout Europe, I met refugees, I met a lot of Jews, and I spoke to some of them.</sentence><sentence id="1348">As a matter of fact, we had one Jewish refugee that we took with us, and he served as a KP, a kitchen police.</sentence><sentence id="1349">He served as a KP for us.</sentence><sentence id="1350">And I befriended him and we talked quite a bit, but we never really talked about details.</sentence><sentence id="1351">He may not have known about all of these things.</sentence><sentence id="1352">He was just a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="1353">And we talked quite a bit because I spoke -- I was one of the only people in my outfit that spoke Yiddish, and that's why I was able to communicate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
