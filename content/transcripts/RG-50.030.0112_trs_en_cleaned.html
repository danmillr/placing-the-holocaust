<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: It was very...we were very badly treated, all of us.</sentence><sentence id="97">Incidentally, there was anti-Semitism in the army.</sentence><sentence id="98">There was no anti-Semitism in the all-<span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Moravia</span> but there was anti-Semitism, even anti-Semitic remarks made by officers.</sentence><sentence id="99">The army was very badly treated by the French.</sentence><sentence id="100">It was ill-equipped.</sentence><sentence id="101">It was...the food was bad.</sentence><sentence id="102">We lived in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where the wind was blowing through and there happened to be...we were in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where generally the the climate is mild, but it was a very cold winter, the winter of 1939-1940.</sentence><sentence id="103">And we believed we are kind of parade army and we will be used when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is defeated, we will be used as the as the core of the Czech army, which will move back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, but when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> suffered one defeat after the other, in May 1940 we were well-equipped, or relatively well-equipped and we were sent to the front and we were...we were positioned uh east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> as part of the army to defend <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and the front was broken and we retreated.</sentence><sentence id="104">We were again...I...my...there there were only small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> left.</sentence><sentence id="105">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> in with which I was was again used at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> and that was the end of the of the campaign of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was defeated and uh I like other people tried to get away from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">Now some people went to where the army in <span class="REGION">southern France</span>...where the army had originally been stationed.</sentence><sentence id="108">I tried to get to <span class="REGION">western France</span> and to get from <span class="REGION">western France</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or to the west, but I couldn't get on any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and finally...finally I ended up at the at the <span class="DLF">Spanish frontier</span> together with some other boys and we thought we would go into <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> so we were afraid of this because we guessed that uh in <span class="REGION">Franco Spain</span> we would be arrested and while we were approaching the <span class="DLF">frontier</span>, we learned from the radio that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> will not occupy the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> but only a stretch of <span class="REGION">territory</span> uh inland from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span>, so when you were beyond this <span class="DLF">demarkation line</span>, you would be in unoccupied France, so we didn't go to it.</sentence><sentence id="109">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and then to to this unoccupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and there I was together with French refugees, my comrades...they're not close friends but whom I had just met...and they went to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="REGION">southern France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">There again I became...or not again, but first 1 became a teacher in a very interesting family.</sentence><sentence id="111">The family was in part very pro-German, very pro-German and the elder part...the elder parts of the family were happy that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> had been defeated and that was so because one of the ladies...it was a tremendous family...one of the ladies was the daughter of the French Prime Minister who in 19...in 1866...who in 1870 uh had declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and on Napoleon the Third and had said we enter this war with a light..-with a light-heart, light-heartedly, .</sentence><sentence id="112">And uh six weeks later they were beaten in , So this lady found a certain satisfaction in the fact that not only her father and her friends under her father's regime had been defeated but but also...but also <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> again, but they were very nice.</sentence><sentence id="113">The young people were...were anti-German.</sentence><sentence id="114">They were very nice and I stayed with them and I taught a little boy and a young girl until one day my wife, my present wife, came and found me there and we traveled together toto__, a little <span class="NPIP">place</span>, near near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemouge</span> (ph) where her father and her mother had been and they found themselves after dramatic circumstances because millions of French people had left, had fled the Germans at this time, and uh I stayed with them but they had nothing to eat and I decided there...and they shared everything but I decided I can't stay with them, so I went on my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="115">Why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span>?</sentence><sentence id="116">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="117">It was in the unoccupied zone and there I was demobilized by the French and there I got a carde identite (ph) as a student.</sentence><sentence id="118">Now very few foreigners had a carde identite, a permission of staying in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">I had one but it...from this I couldn't live and after many attempts to...after many attempts to to find some way of uh ma...making a living which I couldn't do, I I found a job as I told you before in <span class="REGION">western France</span>, again as a teacher in a family, in an aristocratic refuge family and I I decided to go there and but you you could only travel at this time with a special permit, de voyage (ph) it was called so I went to the police and asked for a de voyage and they told me why why you want to go there and I said my aunt is sick because...it wasn't very cleaver but I had no better.. nothing better in mind, so uh they didn't give it.</sentence><sentence id="120">They said uh bring me a certificate from the doctor of your aunt, so of course | didn't bring any.</sentence><sentence id="121">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I was there for several weeks, but this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was...this family lived in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, had a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and of course the people saw me.</sentence><sentence id="122">I was a foreigner there and the police there uh paid attention to me and I had not...I should have registered with the police.</sentence><sentence id="123">I should...I didn't register.</sentence><sentence id="124">I didn't do anything, so after three days...after three weeks, I was arrested and I was sent to the County Vernet (ph).</sentence><sentence id="125">Uh now that was a very arbitrary act because the County Vernet of which I will speak immediately was one of the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">It was the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as far as I know, but uh I was sent there.</sentence><sentence id="127">I was sent with uh together with a pastor, a Romanian pastor who in 19 uh...a protestant pastor who in 1934 had crossed the Place de la Concorde (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> during big demonstrations and he was stopped and he showed his identity card.</sentence><sentence id="128">He was released but apparently...he had nothing to do with this demonstration.</sentence><sentence id="129">He was a church man.</sentence><sentence id="130">They took his identity and then they caught him somewhere and they had his identity that he participated, he was in this demonstration.</sentence><sentence id="131">So uh he was with me and then a poor Portuguese worker who apparently was in the same situation as I had been, working without permission and had been there without identity card, so we got sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And you were arrested not as a Jew but as a...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Not as a Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: Could you talk a little bit about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="176">It's important to realize because projections back often...are often misleading that while in the fall of 1940, the Vichy government started to issue uh anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish laws, generally when we had to deal with the police and even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we were not singled out as being Jews.</sentence><sentence id="177">There was no anti-Semitism except in there...I mean no open anti-Semitism except in in Government levels but we didn't hear any any anti- Jewish remarks and uh anti-Semitism came in to force for us only when we were deported, or when people were arrested as Jews, but that was much later.</sentence><sentence id="178">Of course, many French people might have lost their jobs or their business, but I speak now from my own personal experience.</sentence><sentence id="179">There was no anti-Semitic movement or attitude.</sentence><sentence id="180">We were dirty foreigners.</sentence><sentence id="181">The French have an expression... .</sentence><sentence id="182">Dirty foreigner, and we belonged to the dirty foreigner who potentially took away...took away French jobs, but this reminds me that during my flight uh to the south when the army was dispersed and I tried to go get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, I was once by chance...in the very last days of the French campaign in a <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>, a <span class="INT_SPACE">railroad compartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">There were three British students and a lady, and the lady turned out to be the wife of the French Ambassador to Franco, .</sentence><sentence id="184">She was Madame , and the Monsieur was the successor to , and she came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">She was very friendly and she said since .</sentence><sentence id="186">She says these are the German Jews who have done us this, and this slogan you heard very often, but that was general.</sentence><sentence id="187">That was government propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="188">I personally didn't experience nor observe any anti-Semitism until much later.</sentence><sentence id="189">This was a very, very very populist organi...in the right wing circles.</sentence><sentence id="190">The Ger...German Jews have done us this.</sentence><sentence id="191">This incidentally comes...goes back to the Dreyfuss (ph) affair, because he was a German Jew for...they was also persecuted him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: And once you were interned at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span>...?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: It was interminable, because every event like for instance uh well, in our case it was the...it was the attack of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by the Nazis, where we believed that will be the end of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when we learned about the invasion of Europe by the Allies, by the American and British armies, we always believed now it's the end.</sentence><sentence id="328">It was never the end.</sentence><sentence id="329">It was very frustrating.</sentence><sentence id="330">I mean never.</sentence><sentence id="331">But uh I've never been in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> by I mean in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, people think they have done something and if they're they're...they were innocently imprisoned, and then they had a time limit on their stay.</sentence><sentence id="332">They're there for...they're there for for for life...they have a life sentence, but there there was no hope except the end of the war and a victorious end of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: And would you tell us now about when you were deported, how that happened, how you felt, the people that you had to leave or went with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="342">On the 7th of August, 1942...let me say perhaps on the 6th of August, 1942...no.</sentence><sentence id="343">Let me say on the 6th or Sth, we could see from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the little <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of ___--~ Vernet.</sentence><sentence id="344">There was a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span>, and you could see it.</sentence><sentence id="345">It was uh perhaps a mile away but you could see it, and we saw on the Sth or the 6th of uh August that there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> there which generally were not there and probably on the 6th, a great number of people were surrounded in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we were...and you believed you are...you were free in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">You can...within limits, you were free.</sentence><sentence id="347">We were surrounded and __ say they would be deported.</sentence><sentence id="348">Now all of them were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="349">There were many non-Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I do believe we didn't realize that all of them were Jews because as I said before, there was...we didn't feel being Jews in this sense that we were singled out, and they were deported and they were marched to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and were deported.</sentence><sentence id="350">At the end of August of 1942, something uh incredible happened.</sentence><sentence id="351">Whole families came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and these were all Jews, people, Jewish people who had taken refuge in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and who had managed to live outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, who had some even jobs.</sentence><sentence id="352">How they managed, I don't know...if some lived from their savings and had some savings...but they were people living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they were all brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and that was far sensational.</sentence><sentence id="353">Not only...we had...there were no women in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so there were not only men and women came in...whole families and children.</sentence><sentence id="354">We hadn't seen children for two years, and uh they were not badly treated.</sentence><sentence id="355">Uh they had enough to eat and they were, of course, deeply depressed and I guess they knew already but we might have heard too, that there were de...deportations of Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because I think some people listened...could listen or to the to the British broadcast.</sentence><sentence id="356">They had heard about it, so this was an all Jewish affair.</sentence><sentence id="357">That was very clear, and it was a deportation affair and the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> was also deportation, but it wasn't very clear...didn't seem so much as a punishment.</sentence><sentence id="358">It could be interpreted as a...and since it was only men, it could be interpreted as meaning they are going to work.</sentence><sentence id="359">The Germans uh uh always hired people who were imprisoned or wanted those people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so that they took Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a bit strange but we didn't think about this as far as I remember.</sentence><sentence id="360">It's now fifty years, but as far as I remember about the second time, this was ominous.</sentence><sentence id="361">This was dangerous, and we couldn't understand what it means.</sentence><sentence id="362">And there was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a group of perhaps fifteen, twenty people like I who had been in the French army, and we were suddenly separated from the others and we believed that we are separated because <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> would never send the people who had...who have fought for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, would never surrender those people to the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="363">On the contrary I mean what they did was to be sure that we don't run away, they...it wasn't impossible to run away.</sentence><sentence id="364">In spite of all the guards and for men like...who like me who had a right to be around in the camp because I was postmaster, it would have been considerably possible, like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> later.</sentence><sentence id="365">I'll tell you about it.</sentence><sentence id="366">It was possible, possible to run away.</sentence><sentence id="367">But what happened afterwards is the second question because where would you ever run.</sentence><sentence id="368">You had no papers.</sentence><sentence id="369">You had no mon...money.</sentence><sentence id="370">Uh people there are certainly hostile.</sentence><sentence id="371">If you were to knock at their <span class="DLF">door</span>, who would have helped you.</sentence><sentence id="372">But so they wanted to be sure that we don't run away, but we cer...we misinterpreted this.</sentence><sentence id="373">As a matter of fact there was in the camp a French police officer who was and I was quite on good terms with him because he spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="374">I spoke German with him.</sentence><sentence id="375">One day...and on this day he came and said I have to arrest you, and he arrest me to bring me in the group of the former soldiers and when I realized what I...what he was saying, I spit at him and he slapped me, but it was ina friendly way, and he had likewise because it was profound dishonor.</sentence><sentence id="376">The French think their honor is...their honor has been maintained, the honor of the French army.</sentence><sentence id="377">It was profound dishonor to sen...to send off...apart from everybody else certainly, but to send off to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because the Germans could have killed us immediately.</sentence><sentence id="378">I mean we were...they could have said we...you are former citizens of a <span class="REGION">territory</span> which we have occupied.</sentence><sentence id="379">Therefore, it's against your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="380">You are...you...that is high treason and you have to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="381">Why?</sentence><sentence id="382">On the first of September 19...well, after...after this excitement with having all the people there, these families, and...but they had enough to eat and uh everybody was, of course, preoccupied so again the the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and we knew what they meant and on the lst of September, we were led out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">Now that was unforgettable.</sentence><sentence id="384">It was unforgettable because there were some of the old people with us, old ladies, old men, you know, who had not been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before who were now being imprisoned.</sentence><sentence id="385">Women, children...children, and the worst of all, the most depressing thing was that there were perhaps ten, twelve cripples, people who had no legs, such cripples, and I...I don't recall having seen them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before but it's possible that they had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before, and they were moving on little boards and they had little...little...little wheels, you know, and that's how they were moving forward and I mention them because at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> there was the French Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="386">They were very kind and very sad.</sentence><sentence id="387">They had...they had an inkling of what...what...what's happening to us.</sentence><sentence id="388">Very sad, very kind...their behavior was contradictory and they had to...to lift these cripples into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">You see, these cripples couldn't...couldn't walk.</sentence><sentence id="390">They couldn't...and they had to lift them into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> and there was also something else.</sentence><sentence id="391">Nearby was I think the village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> and the church bells were ringing, so we went.</sentence><sentence id="392">We were...we were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">They...we were not...we were not uh like sardines pressured like later on when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we were, of course, all the time debating and thinking what does it mean.</sentence><sentence id="394">Uh the Germans are going to send us to work, but why would they take us there.</sentence><sentence id="395">You know, the the the German Jews who have been expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1940 to Guerres (ph), thousands of them, and now they're taking all the Jews back.</sentence><sentence id="396">What does it mean?</sentence><sentence id="397">Supposed they are going to to have us work.</sentence><sentence id="398">Why do they take children and and and women?</sentence><sentence id="399">Why did they take these cripples?</sentence><sentence id="400">And there was an endless debate and not only a debate among ourselves but I myself started all the time to figure out all the possibilities.</sentence><sentence id="401">There was no...there was no answer, but if they would massacre everybody.</sentence><sentence id="402">Nobody thought of this....not out of question...I mean that they would kill one or the other.</sentence><sentence id="403">They have...we knew they had killed people.</sentence><sentence id="404">They would kill many, yes, but that they would kill all of us or that their practice was to exterminate these people...and I came finally to the conclusion but that was later on, they are establishing a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish slave state</span> somewhere in the Ukrain and sure they want to have everybody in this slave...you will be slaves.</sentence><sentence id="405">Now uh I managed to send a postcard from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with the help of a French gendarme to my brother who was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where I said I am going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but I really didn't want to, or something to this effect, and see he got the card and it was terribly depressing.</sentence><sentence id="406">After having escaped the Germans, now for years with all the sufferings we had gone through, suddenly everything was in vain.</sentence><sentence id="407">We...we went back.</sentence><sentence id="408">Uh I was with a couple of uh younger persons in the 0 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span>, and we considered breaking out but again the question was, you know, we could have lifted the boards.</sentence><sentence id="409">There was nothing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> but the boards.</sentence><sentence id="410">Uh perhaps you could have lifted them and jumped out and we were...also it was strange the French uh gendarmes, not not the Germans but uh then the question arose .</sentence><sentence id="411">Where are we going?</sentence><sentence id="412">We will be caught again.</sentence><sentence id="413">So after perhaps twenty-four hours, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> and that's in...and then then _-- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> looked horrible.</sentence><sentence id="415"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> consisted of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or which had been made for the French police before the war and which could not be occupied because they were wet and badly built, so they stood empty, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="416">I know...I think they stood empty before we came.</sentence><sentence id="417">Not only before we came...before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> became a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="418">Uh we left incidentally on the Ist...on the 1st of September...the 1st of September of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span>.</sentence><sentence

class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which were full of uh rotten straw.</sentence><sentence id="424">It was rotting, you know.</sentence><sentence id="425">It's wet and rotting, and there we were waiting, and, of course, uh uh being very much concerned and preoccupied what's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="426">It was a morbid situation already you know.</sentence><sentence id="427">Under the rotten straw and with children and uh old people and the complete uh uh the complete helplessness and the complete lack of uh of...we didn't know what's going to happen...to happen to us but we knew, of course, we are now in the clutches of the German and at night we heard sometimes shooting from other parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">We didn't know what it means.</sentence><sentence id="429">I remember I | went to one of the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> and saw...and tried to see whether I can get...I can get out but it was out of

people.</sentence><sentence id="546">I cannot say how many, but I do know when we were...when we came in, we came into the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight</span>, into the <span

we...that would be horrible.</sentence><sentence id="559">We realized it from the very beginning, and I do remember there was no fear of not having enough food, because you see, uh we had gotten bread and French...and especially those of us who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> had been hungry, oh there was plenty of bread, apples, and I think even pate, French pate in

that was meaningless, only we found that is mean on their part.</sentence><sentence id="568">It is possible, likely even that the SS shouted dirty Jews, but I cannot...I don't recall this.</sentence><sentence id="569">1 mean it was clear now we were Jews, andI mention it.</sentence><sentence id="570">Now started the trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, or not quite to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> as you will hear.</sentence><sentence id="571">Uh at the beginning, of course, everybody was depressed and after a couple of hours uh people had to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and they couldn't see well, and___ broke out and people shouted at each other.</sentence><sentence id="572">Uh the water was soon

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: Well, everybody tried to help everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="808">I think you couldn't be an egotist in this situation... mean only concentrate on yourself.</sentence><sentence id="809">You helped your buddy, like he he wasn't a friend in the sense of being a a long...as a result of a long friendship.</sentence><sentence id="810">Everybody tried to help everybody else, if you could.</sentence><sentence id="811">Some people couldn't, but I can tell you later on about .</sentence><sentence id="812">So many people died there and uh I don't know how long we were there.</sentence><sentence id="813">Not long, three days perhaps, and then they formed from the prisoners there, groups and sent them to various <span

people who had come with me, but I...the people with whom I was were put into a strangely enough not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car train</span> but a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> and as far as I can...as I can uh remember, we went towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but this is constructed afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="815">I think there came other...other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were were added to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and we moved...we...first our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved first east and we were not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and perhaps we came very near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and then it moved it west to...when I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, because there were many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz camps</span>...and then we moved west and now let me tell you very briefly why we moved west.</sentence><sentence id="816">Uh there was a man who came with me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">He had gotten very nice uh stamps and uh...from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vernet</span> and the French uh postal officials always stole his stamps so he asked me to take letters addressed to him and bring them to him personally, so I knew him a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="818">His name was Stanislov 5 Kubacheck (ph), and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> moved west and we moved to , he was standing next to me and suddenly started to talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="819">He said to me, I am not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="820">I am a Polish officer, and I cannot say that I am a Polish officer because...you see, he had some confidence in me because I had given him...I had preserved his nice stamps, and if he dared to say that he is a Polish officer, they would take him out and kill him.</sentence><sentence id="821">And he later on...I'll tell you later on...he helped me.</sentence><sentence id="822">He really saved my life twice, so it was Stanislov Kubacheck and then we...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went west and we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="823">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span>...you know what a <span class="BUILDING">hutte</span> is...a <span class="BUILDING">hutte</span> in German is a

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauerhutte</span>...whatever the the Polish name I don't know...the work was very, very, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="837">I remember when they assigned together...I was assigned to this...we were dismantling one of the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blast furnaces</span> and we were carrying heavy pieces of wood which had been in this <span

id="841">Sometimes they were killed, but sometimes...I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="842">It fell in a way where nothing happened, so we were badly beaten and we were beaten to lift this thing

they carried the dead people out and uh and as I said, by November I guess one third of the people had died, and new people came in.</sentence><sentence id="850">Uh at this time, before this happened, I was once ordered to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>...now I don't know whether whether Lauerhutte had a <span

bay</span>, and when we came to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, they had to undress naked and were pushed into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> and the reason why I and my buddy had to come along because we had to take their clothes and bring it back and they probably went to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to the gas, you know.</sentence><sentence

there somebody uh uh a kapo appeared and said the children have to do the following.</sentence><sentence id="1098">There are stones on this side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and they have to

me, isn't it a pity.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Such a nice boy, but he is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1108">He must die.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Now the children's column had no tragic

there, but it was October.</sentence><sentence id="1112">It became...it was very, very cold.</sentence><sentence id="1113">It became colder and colder and uh we didn't know what to do with ourselves
