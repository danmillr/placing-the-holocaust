<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: Can you tell me then what the professional route was that brought you from there, and we'll try to do it fairly briefly that brought you then to the role that you have in interrogation and intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="93">I know it's a big jump.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Well, I'll tell you very quickly what it is.</sentence><sentence id="97">From 1933, September 1933 when I landed here, from practically 1939 I was a student at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> where I earned my masters and ph.d degrees, while also working as a research associate at the Institute of Social Research with all the principals of the so called Frankfort School of Sociology, Social Science, including Max , Herbert F , Henry Grossman, Franz Nuemen, and a number of other people, but the principals were actually, the principal figures were and Fran.</sentence><sentence id="98">Fran not so much among the principals but the first three were.</sentence><sentence id="99">I was a research assistant there, very happy there because this was an intellectual hothouse .</sentence><sentence id="100">It was at the time when the luminaries of the <span class="BUILDING">American Academy</span> were still at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">I still knew and learned a great deal and admired a great deal John Dewy.</sentence><sentence id="102">For my money still <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>'s philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="103">The American philosopher, most represented American philosopher.</sentence><sentence id="104">And the other luminaries would be very much true of this generation of Americans any more, perhaps they do, but I don't think I need mention them here.</sentence><sentence id="105">I got married.</sentence><sentence id="106">That's an important date, to alice Newman in 1937.</sentence><sentence id="107">I became a father of my only child, my daughter Doris, in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="108">In 1939 I became the research assistant more exclusive research assistant to Adoni with the Princeton radio research project.</sentence><sentence id="109">From 1940 to 1943 I was an assistant editor of , the German Jewish New York weekly newspaper where I</sentence><sentence id="111">was by at the time the only American citizen and responsible for all the English language pages and columns as well as for the Jewish political and religious and learned subjects.</sentence><sentence id="112">From 1944 to 1943 I was propaganda analyst for the United States Office of War Information in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">From D-Day until after VJ Day I was propaganda analyst for the Office of War Information, <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, but more especially attached with a small group of American officers to the hush-hush BBC monitoring service located at near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reading</span> with a special duty of writing the so-called report about what the German people were allowed to read and hear by the government of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the theaters of war for the commanders in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, that is the report had to be written for the commanders in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and the policy makers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">Let me say for one thing before I come to VJ day.</sentence><sentence id="115">For all that we won, and we too, that is the secret weapons that the Nazis unleased onto the <span class="REGION">British Isles</span>, the heightened sense and enhanced sense of living I have never experienced before or after.</sentence><sentence id="116">As I think about it as I try to recollect the war time days, my war time days in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> were among the happiest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="117">I made also on my days off, good friendships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cambridge</span> and found very much to be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the cloistered world of the <span class="BUILDING">academy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">I never considered any other <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> as free and so much a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as the <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="119">That's why I spent my life eventually as an academic at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> after the war and after the trials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">I was determined though all along and I so wrote to my wife in the hundreds of letters which she all saved, hundreds of letters which she all saved from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> during the war, even before it was sure, that is in the middle-- let's see D-Day was in "44.</sentence><sentence id="121">In "44 I wrote I'm thinking about what we have to do the day the war ends.</sentence><sentence id="122">I'm determined in having a hand in the rebuilding of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the punishing of the war criminals but in salvaging the best of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in building of the foundations of a just and lasting peace.</sentence><sentence id="123">I'm interested in spite of what I've learned about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidonek</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span>, in spite of it and because of it I'm determined to see that the criminals are punished, that justice is meeted out not at the price of sacrificing millions of innocent women and children.</sentence><sentence id="124">Precisely because I remember what was done and what feelings dominate those who have suffered under Nazi terror.</sentence><sentence id="125">I wanted to save then and I want to save the world from any boomerang effects of a wrong policy of treating wrongly the defeated enemy.</sentence><sentence id="126">But I said to my wife, we have to remember that for our own sake, if not for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s sake we must lay the foundation for just and proper forms of democratic life so that the Germans become an essential constituent of a sound economy and a sound Europe at least in the west.</sentence><sentence id="127">Now, I hope you'll share my opinion, I said to my wife.</sentence><sentence id="128">My wife wrote me even more than several hundred letters.</sentence><sentence id="129">She wrote me every day.</sentence><sentence id="130">I couldn't write every day, so she probably wrote a hundred more letters than I did myself.</sentence><sentence id="131">I wanted to know all about our baby.</sentence><sentence id="132">I wanted to know all about herself, and I wanted to reassure her that I would do nothing without her approval, because it's a joint life that we have to live for whatever life will be granted to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="687">A: I must say the whole lot of them with one exception made the same impression on me, a very said and drab impression.</sentence><sentence id="688">The one exception because he had an extraordinary 1.Q.was , the former president.</sentence><sentence id="689">He had a very good i.Q. yes, but you know what the strange thing is, he wanted to be interrogated as he was eventually by a Colonel who eventually became a U.S. District Court Justice.</sentence><sentence id="690">He was up on economics and he wanted to be interrogated on his economic brilliance and specialties and all that sort and insisted on having an interrogator to whom he could really disclose what his contribution was to both the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> up and the undermining boring from within of the Nazi government until he was booted out.</sentence><sentence id="691">The only man with a superior 1.Q.who impressed me as such sat there in the dark of the open military tribune asked by a mistake on our part, he was associated with the wrong kind of club.</sentence><sentence id="692">He said as if the whole thing didn't concern him, just this motley crew over there, rightly so, rightly so, but I associated with them.</sentence><sentence id="693">He was acquitted eventually.</sentence><sentence id="694">I saw him on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> subsequently to.</sentence><sentence id="695">I didn't want to talk to him.</sentence><sentence id="696">I didn't want to give him the satisfaction that he got off without punishment because he had also helped them.</sentence><sentence id="697">He was early,-- he belonged to the early conservatives who joined with , aristocrats, the Nazi government, you know.</sentence><sentence id="698">He was among those who persuaded Hintenberg too that everything was going to be fine until he found out better and had to be put on ice himself.</sentence><sentence id="699">But he was put on trial for helping the big shots into their saddle.</sentence><sentence id="700">It was the right and just thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="701">Compared with the job of course performed by the others, his was minor, a minor crime compared.</sentence><sentence id="702">It was a big crime.</sentence><sentence id="703">I wouldn't have let him go scot free, but compared to the crimes committed by the others, he impressed me by his intelligence and by the nerve he actually had and a sense of humor too and dissociated himself publicly by gesture and position and posture from the rest of the crew.</sentence><sentence id="704">But the rest of them as I said, sad and drab mediocrities.</sentence><sentence id="705">Sad and drab.</sentence><sentence id="706">Physically unattractive, no disgusting, especially , who insisted on talking to us in English most of the time, which he knew fairly well.</sentence><sentence id="707">His German was miserable.</sentence><sentence id="708">I talked to him in German and tried to correct him several times, but none of his sentences were ever completed.</sentence><sentence id="709">Most of the time they ended help me, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="710">This man had an important figure at the time he was in power.</sentence><sentence id="711">Now, the whole lot of them including the military were just sheer sad and drab mediocrities.</sentence><sentence id="712">The only one who as I said who admitted on occasion responsibility for what was done over an order that showed his signature was Goering, but he too was an inferior being and the tip off that signaled that inferior being was his demeanor and attitude toward I don't know if I mentioned that before toward the big four.</sentence><sentence id="713">To the French, the weakest of the Allies, he was patronizing if not scornful.</sentence><sentence id="714">To the Americans, he tried to impress us as a kind of guy who would be a good fellow to the bucaneering Americans who were suckered on Hollywood films.</sentence><sentence id="715">To the British who are precise, cold, correct, he tried to emulate a gentlemenlines because he respected the British, but when he saw a Russian, he winced.</sentence><sentence id="716">The minute the Russian officer entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation room</span>, he winced and cringed slightly.</sentence><sentence id="717">He knew of no posture that would</sentence><sentence id="719">2 impress a Russian.</sentence><sentence id="720">He was scared to death of any Russian and every Russian that entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="721">And that, let me tell you, was true of the whole lot of them.</sentence><sentence id="722">The whole motley crew.</sentence><sentence id="723">I had no respect for any one of them, and I couldn't in as much as I tried to show even a spark of sympathy for any of them, I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="724">And I'm not a harsh man myself.</sentence><sentence id="725">I can sympathize.</sentence><sentence id="726">I can empathize, but what I saw there imagine me empathizing with a disgusting creature like Striezer.</sentence><sentence id="727">It was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="728">The way he appeared he struck me as belonging to an inferior animal kingdom like rats and vermin more than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="729">I had a physical disgust actually towards most of them.</sentence><sentence id="730">I would have hated to be touched by them.</sentence><sentence id="731">I didn't shake hands with anyone.</sentence><sentence id="732">There was one exception among all the people that I interrogated myself and that was : SS general, young, university educated, gangster, but handsome, intelligent charming courteous differential, respectful, especially of a fellow academic, which he recognized in me immediately.</sentence><sentence id="733">He almost succeeded in deceiving me.</sentence><sentence id="734">You know I'm the kind of person who was brought up to regard Latin and Greek, if not Hebrew as the proper guise, the proper garment of the truth.</sentence><sentence id="735">I thought anybody brought up in what I called , in the humanist spirit could be nothing other than a humanist scholar and a benefactor to mankind and person interested in nothing but the welfare, the well being and happiness of mankind.</sentence><sentence id="736">He also succeeded in deceiving me into believing that he really belonged on my side.</sentence><sentence id="737">That he was really interested in salvaging and making available to me what was to be made available in way of searching and finding the truth for the benefit of those who were responsible now for building a better world.</sentence><sentence id="738">He almost succeeded in doing this until I found out about his background, which was shortly thereafter.</sentence><sentence id="739">Shortly after I had thoroughly interrogated him, he had in a manner of speaking my sympathy.</sentence><sentence id="740">He was my favorite culprit.</sentence><sentence id="741">He was the one person I felt at ease with and to whom I offered a cigarette.</sentence><sentence id="742">I didn't do that to anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="743">I tried to make him feel at ease, and whom I interrogated.</sentence><sentence id="744">Now, that's very interesting, who I interrogated on side interests.</sentence><sentence id="745">I was also interested as a zionist in making sure that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would become <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, that is that the zionist of course would prevail, win, and win as much as it could.</sentence><sentence id="746">And that some of the hopes and some of the hopes of the surviving Jewish people could be fulfilled.</sentence><sentence id="747">So, I interrogated him about well he must have had and did in fact have access to the of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="748">When did he meet the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> I asked him and under what circumstances and where was that and what was the subject discussed at the time, for what purpose.</sentence><sentence id="749">Well, substantively the end of the interrogation was substantially came out of interrogation is all he wanted from the was intelligence and all he shared with him was intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="750">And I said well wasn't the interested in the final solution so called of the Jewish person to applied to be anywhere Jews were a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> could be found even in the <span class="REGION">far East</span>.</sentence><sentence id="751">Oh, no, he'd never ask him about that with no word.</sentence><sentence id="752">I said well, tell me in truth, you know it's all over now, tell me what happened.</sentence><sentence id="753">No, I can't tell you doctor.</sentence><sentence id="754">I can't tell you, he said.</sentence><sentence id="755">Well, then tell me something else.</sentence><sentence id="756">With whom else did he work, and what else was he interested in.</sentence><sentence id="757">Did he have any plans about the final solution?</sentence><sentence id="758">Didn't he promise he would try to execute final solution designs also carried him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">Nothing of the sort is known to me, no sir, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="760">Well, I couldn't pump him for more.</sentence><sentence id="761">It was all over.</sentence><sentence id="762">Eventually I had found out that this was a man who joined from</sentence><sentence id="764">3 day one, which was very early at the beginning of the war the SS, and that he had become one of the favorites of Himler himself and that he ended up as a general in charge of intelligence of <span class="BUILDING">office</span> four in charge of security and intelligence of the <span class="BUILDING">Security Head Office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">I also found out eventually that he was the guy who was supposed to kidnap in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> the Duke and the Duchess of Windsor.</sentence><sentence id="766">That he was I found that among the documents too, and charged with about it and said make no mistakes and he checked things with as well as with Hitler directly.</sentence><sentence id="767">And that he had succeeded even during the so called period, you know right at the beginning before the invasion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> and the <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="768">He had made contacts in the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> at the <span class="DLF">German Dutch border</span> with two British intelligence

at all.</sentence><sentence id="773">But among the more interesting I think for our purposes, for me and trying to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the zionist course, was my interrogation of .</sentence><sentence id="774">Adolph Eishman's immediate subordinate.</sentence><sentence id="775">He was one of our witnesses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> too, in my

first labor party representative of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="778">Together with him, I interrogated the and alone without anybody else in German only about the whereabouts of Adolph Eishman.</sentence><sentence id="779">What Eishman's role was everybody else knows.</sentence><sentence id="780">I don't have to repeat that.</sentence><sentence id="781">He played a major role for which he was eventually judged in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="782">But the search for

anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="784">We did not succeed in getting out probably because he didn't know where Eishman had disappeared to.</sentence><sentence id="785">He, as I said to the just about a year ago to a German t.v.</sentence><sentence id="786">reporter who interviewed me in connection with a film about Hanna Aurandt, who was a close friend of mine, about Eishman, I said you know the

could pump him to the nth degree, but we didn't succeed in doing that.</sentence><sentence id="787">We pumped him for a lot of information involving Eishman, involving to the extent that he was accused and had to respond to all the accusations before the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>, but something interesting that I asked and that I interrogated about was disclosed in the course of that interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="788">I asked him can you tell me why when it did not make any military sense at all that your Fuhrer insisted on having the Jews transported when transport was very difficult from the west all the way to the east.</sentence><sentence id="789">Why didn't you kill them right on the

no.</sentence><sentence id="792">We couldn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="793">The German people wouldn't take to it, wouldn't like that very much.</sentence><sentence id="794">But in the east

Jews there either.</sentence><sentence id="799">They have a long history of not likening them.</sentence><sentence id="800">That to me, was a profound shock that there were people among those who suffered under the Nazis who had even were grateful at the same time, if not grateful, but showed sympathy to the Nazis for one task, the kind of destructive work in which they were engaged against the whole world.</sentence><sentence id="801">That was a profound shock, and a severe lesson.</sentence><sentence id="802">There are enemies in our own ranks and we have to guard against them, and be mindful of them.</sentence><sentence id="803">There are also allies.</sentence><sentence id="804">He never said that we suppress the Poles, .</sentence><sentence id="805">They had an anti-Slav
