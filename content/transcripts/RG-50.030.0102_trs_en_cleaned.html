<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1140">A: The man who kept the...who kept the identities cards.</sentence><sentence id="1141">The identity cards.</sentence><sentence id="1142">He called me to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>; and he told me, "Give me your card.</sentence><sentence id="1143">I'll give it back to you next week, "cause I have to change the age, or the time or something."</sentence><sentence id="1144">And I had a feeling that I shouldn't give it.</sentence><sentence id="1145">And I had not discussed it with my "Aunt," but I had a feeling not to give him.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And I say, "No, she'll give you next week."</sentence><sentence id="1147">And next morning, at six in the morning, he was killed with the papers from 25 or 40 people that he had.</sentence><sentence id="1148">And all these people were taken.</sentence><sentence id="1149">And I thank God.... Must have been a will from God that, uh, that I wasn't taken; because he didn't have my papers.</sentence><sentence id="1150">If he would have my papers, it would be the same as my papers.</sentence><sentence id="1151">So that's all.</sentence><sentence id="1152">And, uh, I had a lot of little events; events that I would feel bad if...like Germans would go in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and go and look for something or what.</sentence><sentence id="1153">So instinctively, I thought it's for me.</sentence><sentence id="1154">I got nervous that they're looking for me.</sentence><sentence id="1155">But I think when you are in the situation, you are stronger and braver.</sentence><sentence id="1156">I could pay attention myself you see.</sentence><sentence id="1157">I knew when to let go, because like when he ...they looked for me when I was like buried.</sentence><sentence id="1158">I knew I have to breathe my nose, my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I have to keep up "til they come to save me.</sentence><sentence id="1160">When they came, they were happy that I was breathing; because it was very hard for me.</sentence><sentence id="1161">So, problem is that uh the closest from my aunt's, my uncle's--twenty-four people the closest--were taken all to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1162">So sometimes I say, if people complain, people should be happy.</sentence><sentence id="1163">It is a too narrow <span class="DLF">road</span>, people set in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, came from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1164">But there is no one day that I forget my parents or Raphaele.</sentence><sentence id="1165">Because she...really did a lot for me.</sentence><sentence id="1166">And if not, I wouldn't be alive.</sentence><sentence id="1167">So that's the reason I always want her to feel good, to buy something special for her, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1168">That's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
