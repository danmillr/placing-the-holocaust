<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What was your experience of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span> or what did you hear?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Well, it was interesting.</sentence><sentence id="98">We had a sudden telephone call from my 16yearold cousin who was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and she told us that "Uncle Iz" as she called himmy father whose name was <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">Should go for a walk, and of course we immediately realized that somehow he shouldn't be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so he went over and stayed with his sister because we knew the Gestapo didn't look in <span class="BUILDING">women's houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">They only looked in families.</sentence><sentence id="101">They</sentence><sentence id="103">didn't look at <span class="BUILDING">women's houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">My uncle went to his girlfriend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">My grandfather stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because he was 72 already.</sentence><sentence id="106">And my brother of course was only 12; so we didn't think that that was dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="107">We had a visit from our janitor's wife who asked us whether father was in, and we said no he wasn't, and I don't really know why she visited whether she visited with a view to telling him to go out or whether the Gestapo had sent her on an advance to make sure that he was there, but in any event we were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="108">He was gone, and about ten minutes later two black leather coated men came up and asked for my father.</sentence><sentence id="109">We said he had gone out, and they very politely asked to look through the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to make sure; and we said, "Sure go right ahead."</sentence><sentence id="110">And of course he was gone, and they saw my grandfather sleeping there and asked how old he was, and we told him 72, and after they left, I remember my mother saying she was shaking all over, poor thing.</sentence><sentence id="111">And of course us children we didn't realize the import of it all.</sentence><sentence id="112">But it was from that day onward that we did think of getting out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What steps did you take to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: It's so happened that at our <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, there were some forms being passed around where a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> had gotten together with a parentteacher association, and they had decided to bring to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> three children: One from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, one from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and one from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in fact three girls because it was a <span class="BUILDING">girl's school</span>, and since my parents said, well really should try to get out, I completed the form, and it was sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">And I was very lucky to be chosen the German girl to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">So in May 21--I shan't never forget it of course--we went to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, and off I went with the children's transport.</sentence><sentence id="136">It was a dreadful experience because there was a Polish woman on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> who was being dragged away by Gestapo men by her hair, and she was screaming, and we didn't really know whether we'd all by arrested before we left.</sentence><sentence id="137">So it was very awful in leaving my parents really not with a view that I wouldn't see them again because I never thought that would happen.</sentence><sentence id="138">But it's a new experience to go a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with another language, and I remember I had a little gold ring and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">train compartment</span>, somebody mentioned that, "oh, we shouldn't have any jewelry with us."</sentence><sentence id="139">And I remember going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and hiding this little gold ring, and after we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, I picked it up again.</sentence><sentence id="140">I think it was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span>, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="141">But it was--we were very happy when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">It was like we could suddenly breathe freely, and there was some people in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> that brought us cookies and crackers and welcomed us with juices.</sentence><sentence id="143">And it was like being in another world, and it's very odd, but after I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I started growing and getting bigger.</sentence><sentence id="144">I used to be a really thin little thing, and I guess being in a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> makes you think and eat differently, and I became a normal 13yearold.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: Tell me, you say your parents were planing to emigrate.</sentence><sentence id="158">Had they made any attempts to emigrate as a family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: Only illegal attempts.</sentence><sentence id="165">My father was very scared that at the last minute at the <span class="DLF">border</span> we would be caught, and of course that would be worse than not going out at all.</sentence><sentence id="166">So when I left, one of the things my parents had tried to get us out, which I did tried to do and I did manage to get my twin brother out, but unfortunately the war broke out, and I could not get my parents out, and they perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: On Kristallnacht, when your father was fortunate enough to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, do you know of any other men who were not so well prepared, and what happened to those?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: Yes, I remember about six weeks after Kristallnacht, my father's brother who was a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.49624" long="7.45676">Dortmund</span> came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and he had frostbitten fingers and toes, and he looked absolutely dreadful.</sentence><sentence id="173">He had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">And then my English teacher came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and his teeth, his front teeth, had been smashed in.</sentence><sentence id="175">And it was a very dreadful experience for us because as children you grow up trusting, trusting your parents, trusting the system, and all of a sudden you realize that you're on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looking in, and things won't get better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: These men came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Well, as far as I can remember, I guess the Germans were not ready yet to keep men on a permanent basis; so that they let them go after about six weeks, and then they fined all Jews for the murder of Vom Rath, and we all had to give up part of our silver and pay money to compensate the Germans for having lost Vom Rath which was the excuse, of course.</sentence><sentence id="183">And eventually, of course, they did get <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ready, but at that time they didn't have sufficient facilities to keep people.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I think they would have been very happy to let all the Jews go out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because but of course they weren't allowed to take their money with them anyway, so they would have kept the money and got rid of the Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: They would have been happy to get the Jews go, but the Jews weren't ready to go then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="191">I think the Jews were ready to go, but they didn't want to go without any money, which is what they would have had to do.</sentence><sentence id="192">My father lost his four <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">They were all broken into, and things were stolen, and after that he didn't have any work anymore.</sentence><sentence id="194">So it was living on your income, whatever you had, but not making any more money.</sentence><sentence id="195">So it was a matter of really thinking we have to get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="196">But it was easier said than done.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: What was your experience as a Jew in the non Jewish community before Hitler and then after Hitler came aboutcame to power.</sentence><sentence id="205">Was there any change in the attitude of your friends and neighbors?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: We really didn't have Christian friends because of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we went to with the other little girl was Jewish also, and just like in any big society in an apartment life, you</sentence><sentence id="210">don't really have neighbors with whom you associate.</sentence><sentence id="211">So I can really say because we were all in Jewish circles.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Was there any change among the people that you weren't necessarily friendly with, but neighbors?</sentence><sentence id="219">Did you discern increased hostility?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="223">We lived our lives completely apart, but we were very careful not to give any neighbors cause to criticize us.</sentence><sentence id="224">I remember very clearly listening to the BBC and foreign broadcasts, and our parents always while they were listening, had us gomy brother went to one <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I went to the other to make sure the noise wasn't penetrating the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> so thatbecause you could get arrested for listening to foreign news services.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: On your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and toward <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, tell me how were you provided for?</sentence><sentence id="229">Did you take food along with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: I don't really remember whether we took food along, but we did get fed when we crossed the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span>, and we were also fed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> before we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">And I shall never forget that because we had white bread, which I had never seen before and cornflakes, which was another thing that was new in my life, not having eaten cereals in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">And then by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> guess it must have been in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, and names were called of children, and various people picked them up and when my name came, there was a young blonde girl by name of Yolanda who came and picked me up, and she explained to me that she was the ward of the head mistress of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who had really been very much ahead of her timesingle woman who had adopted a German, a Czech, and an Austrian child.</sentence><sentence id="235">And the German teacher had paid for my school education, which I didn't find out until the very end.</sentence><sentence id="236">Anyway, I'm proceeding myself.</sentence><sentence id="237">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of a Norman and Elsie Denim where I was to live.</sentence><sentence id="238">They had a daughter about my age who went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and a son four years older, and Yolanda spoke a little bit of German to me, and this was when she got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, she said, "Well, that's the last time I'll be speaking German with you."</sentence><sentence id="239">And I was sort of scared because I didn't speak very much English.</sentence><sentence id="240">But everybody was very welcoming.</sentence><sentence id="241">And I do remember that we had tea, and everybody sat around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, all these new people chattering in English, and there was something that looked like chocolate paste, and I asked the young boy by name of Hue what it was, and he spoke a little German so he explained to me that it was chocolate the (?</sentence><sentence id="242">retch?)</sentence><sentence id="243">It turned out to be Marmite and very spicy, and I learned very soon to take very little of it.</sentence><sentence id="244">And then I went upstairs and cried.</sentence><sentence id="245">I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and cried, and after that I guess I decided this was my new life, and I was going to have to accommodate to it.</sentence><sentence id="246">And people were very, very kind.</sentence><sentence id="247">I'm still in touch with Marry, my foster sister, and Hue, my foster brother.</sentence><sentence id="248">We visit each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and we've been very close friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="266">Q: Were you able to contact your parents during this period?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="271">A: I wrote to my parents on a regular basis, and they answered, and Auntie Elsie took me to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish language school</span> every Sunday, which was a big sacrifice for her because they were very devout Plymouth Brethren Christians, and so she missed the Sunday morning service taking me to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew class</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: What were you permitted to bring on your trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> when you left <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Well, I remember I was allowed to carry one suitcase, which of course we each had to carry ourselves, and I remember my mother buying me some nice clothing to take along, all of which turned out to be completely unsuitable because we wore uniforms to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">And as soon as I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, friends of Marry's would contribute school uniforms for me to wear, and as I said, I grew too quickly after that that in no time flat I had out gown all my beautiful clothes.</sentence><sentence id="277">I remember that when I was evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chichester</span> after the war had started, Auntie Elsie sold my clothes, and all I got from these beautiful garmentswhich actually I think I never wore againwere three pairs of black woollen stockings which I detested but which were part of our school uniform and I had to wear.</sentence><sentence id="278">And I guess I've always remembered it because I was so unhappy about losing all these beautiful things.</sentence><sentence id="279">But makes sense; they didn't fit me anymore.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: How did you feel?</sentence><sentence id="286">You were from obviously from a welltodo family, and suddenly you're taking handmedowns from other families.</sentence><sentence id="287">You were an impoverished child.</sentence><sentence id="288">How did that affect you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Well, it didn't bother me too much.</sentence><sentence id="294">Everybody was so kind, and it bothered me a little bit about the clothes as I said, but generally speaking, I was feeling so liberated and wonderful to be out of this scary atmosphere where you couldn't say what you thought, and all of a sudden I could say whatever I felt like, and when I saw a policeman and I cringed, Auntie Elsie would say, "You don't have to be afraid of "our Bobbies"," which they were called in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="295">They will always be there to help you."</sentence><sentence id="296">And it was such a wonderful feeling to be free, really free.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: How did you feel about being Jewish in an essentially <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Christian community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: I didn't worry about it at all because everybody was so very kind to me that I just felt I was one of the people, and nobody ever asked me was I Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="304">Nobody treated me differently because I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="305">And as children will, they take for granted that whatever happens to them is the right thing, so I had no worry about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: Tell me more please about your experience in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Sunday school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: Well, we walked across the common every Sunday morning, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew class</span>, and having been told by my parents that I really should try and get our family out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I approached the head rabbi who was teaching us one Sunday morning and asked him if they could not find a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my brother.</sentence><sentence id="312">And he looked at me and he said,</sentence><sentence id="314">"Oh.</sentence><sentence id="315">You're the little girl who lives with nonJewish people."</sentence><sentence id="316">And I said, "Yes, I am."</sentence><sentence id="317">And he said, "Well, until you move to a Jewish family, there's nothing we can do."</sentence><sentence id="318">So I said to him, "But if I move to a Jewish family, I'm already taking away the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that my brother could take."</sentence><sentence id="319">And he said, "No, no there's nothing we can do until you move to a Jewish family."</sentence><sentence id="320">So I left <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> very depressed and very unhappy and started crying on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and Auntie Elsie said to me, "What's the matter?</sentence><sentence id="321">Why are you crying?"</sentence><sentence id="322">And I told her about the incident, and it was Auntie Elsie and Uncle Norman who decided to adopt my brother who then came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at the beginning of August 1939 and started to process papers for my parents to come over, but unfortunately due to the war breaking out in September, they never made it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: How did you feel telling Auntie Elsie what the rabbi had said to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
