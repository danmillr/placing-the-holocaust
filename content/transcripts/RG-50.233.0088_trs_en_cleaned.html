<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Was he able to continue practicing medicine?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: Well that's an interesting story -- because he served in the First World War and had been decorated for distinguished service the army kind of was able to protect their own as it were and Hitler couldn't do very much.</sentence><sentence id="16">So he was allowed to practice for a very, very long time and he was of the opinion that Hitler was blowing over and that then things would be better.</sentence><sentence id="17">So we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until 1939 which isn't to say that we didn't want to leave earlier.</sentence><sentence id="18">After Kristallnacht I don't think any Jews had any doubt of what was going to be the mood of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">I wouldn't say the fate of all Jews because it wasn't known at that time.</sentence><sentence id="20">So during Kristallnacht, for example, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> alone with my grandfather, my father's father, while they were getting ready in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, they bought all this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that you see here, they bought all of that and they got ready to emigrate.</sentence><sentence id="21">And I would always be left with different people, my grandfather in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span> or my grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> while they would leave.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: So the fact that he was a war veteran and a physician didn't make any difference?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: At that point it didn't matter anymore.</sentence><sentence id="72">At that point Hitler had taken over the army.</sentence><sentence id="73">And so the army was powerless.</sentence></p></dialogue>
