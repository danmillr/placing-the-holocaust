<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu Jiu</span>, I want to tell you something which I like to be made...made...make it public.</sentence><sentence id="186">We stopped in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>--the name is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Craiova--</span>to change the engine to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu Jiu</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">It was in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="188">The soldier opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence

them.</sentence><sentence id="211">And, uh, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, it was a very interesting mixture of people.</sentence><sentence id="212">It...it was divided in four and seven classes...uh, seven departments.</sentence><sentence id="213">And this department one or two, it was ...it was some opposition of the Antonescus--and, uh, generals and, uh, diplomats, which they

class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I said to myself, "Hey.</sentence><sentence id="216">At least, here I'll be, uh, nobody's yelling to me.</sentence><sentence id="217">No...no ...no...no...no...nobody will call me dirty names, and so on."</sentence><sentence id="218">Walking in front of this, uh, [third] department of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, which we didn't know who they are--these people, they start to yell to us and curs...cursing us.</sentence><sentence id="219">I said, "Here, too?!"</sentence><sentence id="220">Where there are the Legionnaires.</sentence><sentence id="221">And department four, there were womans.</sentence><sentence id="222">The department five, it was the evacuees.</sentence><sentence id="223">We stood [NB:

camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tirgu Jiu</span> with a period of time, uh, four months, almost four months, when we are sent back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hu_i</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">And we are put in, uh, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local camp</span>, into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">We are obliged to wear the yellow badge.</sentence><sentence id="233">And we are from time to time allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and to change our underwear.</sentence><sentence id="234">Talking about this, I want to repeat another story about this, what happens.</sentence><sentence id="235">When I received my first, uh, "approval," how to say, to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to change my, my, uh, underwear, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hu_i</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">Uh, I remember that it was way to go to...to my hou...my parents" <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">And I know [one is] quite, uh...not a very, uh...not a

didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="239">I want to go see people, and people to see me; because everybody knows me there.</sentence><sentence id="240">And I remember that walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, I saw a girl which it was a very good friend of my young years.</sentence><sentence id="241">And she saw me, too.</sentence><sentence id="242">But she saw...seeing me coming with the yellow badge, she crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">She didn't want to talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="244">And I walked farther.</sentence><sentence id="245">And it was in the center of the <span class="DLF">street</span>; people usually walked in the center, they stood [NB: stayed], they talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="246">And a friend of mine, uh, which are very close, he was a...a Romanian.</sentence><sentence id="247">And he saw me.</sentence><sentence id="248">And in front of all the people, he came to me and he hugged me.</sentence><sentence id="249">It was just a rebellion, to hug a Jew with a...with...with a yellow badge.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I want to say this, and to be--how to say?--forever.</sentence><sentence id="251">Because I can't forget this.</sentence><sentence id="252">Unfortunately, he died after the war.</sentence><sentence id="253">He was...he
