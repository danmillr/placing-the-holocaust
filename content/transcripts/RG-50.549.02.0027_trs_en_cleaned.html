<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: Where was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: This was in that -- in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span>, which we visited two years ago.</sentence><sentence id="86">I think my wife told you about a visit to -- the trip there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="91">A: Yeah, well, it started with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">A -- I -- I was not there when the tragedy happened.</sentence><sentence id="93">I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>, working a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">And I found out about -- I knew -- I -- I -- the Soviet -- I -- read the Soviet press, even though I worked for a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span>, we had a cultural life.</sentence><sentence id="95">There were -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> with papers and books which you could read.</sentence><sentence id="96">As a matter of fact, I ha -- even had the privilege of subscribing for -- to -- to the Pravda, one of the Soviet papers, for a short while, for a few months, because the librarian, who was also a internee like myself, had about half a dozen papers he could give, to give us a semblance of kind of freedom and culture.</sentence><sentence id="97">So, he gave me the privilege of sur-surpri -- which was dirt cheap, it was pennies.</sentence><sentence id="98">But, to me it had a big value besides reading it, I could read it in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">But I could sell it afterward for the purpose of rolling cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="100">I, myself, was smoking.</sentence><sentence id="101">And we used to have a kind of -- there was some commerce in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">Womens used to come out from</sentence><sentence id="104"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0027 5 <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and had a little -- put like a -- a <span class="BUILDING">kiosk</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">And if you had money, you could buy things.</sentence><sentence id="106">They used to bring in milk, he used to bring in tobacco, which was sold by the glass.</sentence><sentence id="107">Actually, that was not even tobacco, it was tobacco roots, which were chopped up with an ax and you rolled it in newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="108">Now, once a mon -- once a week, I used to sell my bread ration in this commerce in -- intercamp commerce -- intracamp commerce, and buy tobacco.</sentence><sentence id="109">But I had to buy a newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="110">A newspaper cost 10 rubles.</sentence><sentence id="111">So, when I had five newspapers or six newspapers a week, I could sell five of them and one use for my own needs and with others I used to get the 50 rubles and use it to buy the tobacco roots, see?</sentence><sentence id="112">So, while I had it, I was in very good shape, financially.</sentence><sentence id="113">I didn't have to sell my bread ration.</sentence><sentence id="114">So -- and in the press, there wasn't much about the Final Solution.</sentence><sentence id="115">The Soviet press didn't write much about it, they wrote about atrocities committed against the Soviet people, none that mentioned Jews.</sentence><sentence id="116">Of course the particular Jews [indecipherable] designed to be exterminated.</sentence><sentence id="117">But -- And they knew about it, of course, but they didn't -- I remember when the revolt broke out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, there was a little column, one column, but about four or five inches tall, about a revolt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, which was liquidated by -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> was liquidated by the German -- the German occupiers.</sentence><sentence id="118">Not mentioning much about just one word to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="119">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, of course, they had to mention the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because there's only one kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">So they mentioned it.</sentence><sentence id="121">So there wasn't much about it.</sentence><sentence id="122">But one day, when the forces -- the Soviet forces approached not far from where my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was located, I wrote a letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the -- somebody in the ci -- town council, asking if</sentence><sentence id="124"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0027 6 there's any information about my family.</sentence><sentence id="125">It so happened that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was not liberated yet.</sentence><sentence id="126">It was still -- there was still the -- the -- the front was there in the -- the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">For quite awhile, <span class="NPIP">places</span> changed hands back and forth, but I -- another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> close to it, was already liberated.</sentence><sentence id="128">And a friend of mine, who was a former partisan, where my brother was also a partisan of the sa -- the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the same time.</sentence><sentence id="129">He was already liberated and he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">And when they saw my name -- my return address, with my name on it, he opened the letter and he sent it to my brother.</sentence><sentence id="131">He read it, sent to my brother and my brother answered it.</sentence><sentence id="132">And he -- he just wrote me that he is -- he knows that he -- he is -- he is alive, everything is -- all is well.</sentence><sentence id="133">He works now as -- doing -- as a guard in an NKVD, secret -- <span class="DLF">secret police farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">And he sent me -- he would sent me some money.</sentence><sentence id="135">Course, they used to speculate theirselves by [indecipherable] and he knew that I was in bad shape, so he send me some money.</sentence><sentence id="136">A few days later, I got a letter from one of my friend -- a former brother-in-law of mine, as a matter of fact, and then his brother, describing what happened and how it happened and who survived and did not survive.</sentence><sentence id="137">So I knew -- then I find out what happened.</sentence><sentence id="138">And I had in mind that my wi -- in 1945, after the war, the Poles and the Soviets conclude an agreement to let -- this ha -- by the way, this information is in the videotape, but I'm telling you so you understand what I am talking about -- had an agreement to let all of those who were former Polish citizens, til "39, coo -- provided they are Jews or Poles, not Ukrainians or Russians, could get out, back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">And after a year, they find -- this is a long story, but doesn't make any sense, it repeats again.</sentence><sentence id="140">I left the Soviet Union, you know, and then came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">But, I</sentence><sentence id="143">ontectnetonancedjusietneey for ther biormatierabouttfisenecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 7 ha -- I thought I'Il be able to go by this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and see what -- you know, where the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was, at least, fo-found out what happened.</sentence><sentence id="144">But luckily, luckily, I could not stop there, because th-they routed me through a different way, through <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span>, through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> and - - but I always dreamed about coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Povorsk</span> and putting up a monument, which was impossible during Soviet days.</sentence><sentence id="145">First of all, they didn't allow any monuments which specifically said Jews perished there.</sentence><sentence id="146">Soviet citizens, yes, but not Jews.</sentence><sentence id="147">So, i-in -- in -- and at that time, this -- this was a very dangerous <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, because Ukrainian nationalists already harassed the Soviet army and killed the Jews, just like the Poles did after the war, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="148">So, is good that they did not go through.</sentence><sentence id="149">But I -- I -- It was a kind of - - became an obsession for me to come and put up a <span class="DLF">monument</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">Now, when you co -- then they st -- they started allowing already do -- before Gorbachov's time already, they start allowing put up with and even in Yiddish or in Hebrew, what happened -- descriptions on these monuments, and they allowed to have Jews.</sentence><sentence id="151">I don't know if you know about that pol -- a Soviet write up of the name of Viefter Schenko, who wrote a poem about, "There's no monument in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babier</span>," which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.45" long="30.523">Kiev</span> -- probably heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="152">And he wrote he's ashamed being a Russian, that they did not allow to put up m-monuments in these <span class="NPIP">places</span>, so they did allow, finally they did allow.</sentence><sentence id="153">And then, in the beg -- middle of this decade, since "95, I think, <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> became independent and they allowed, already.</sentence><sentence id="154">And there was a fellow in our -- in -- in the -- in the <span class="REGION">province</span> there, who, as a matter of fact, he's -- he -- he was the -- the -- the secretary of the Communist party in the -- in the -- yeah, he was half Jewish, too, but he didn't -- he said himself Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="155">And he</sentence><sentence id="157">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0027 8 started putting up this monument with government help, first Soviet and then the independent <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">I got in touch with him, I found out there is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a organization, it's called the <span class="BUILDING">House of Waleen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Waleen</span> is the name of the province which has records of many.</sentence><sentence id="160">There's probably, in that part, hundreds of thousands of Jews perished.</sentence><sentence id="161">They didn't send them to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, they killed them right then and there.</sentence><sentence id="162">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was exploded dump, oil dump that the Soviets built and they exploded it and then they used it for when they killed th-the German [indecipherable] they dump the Jews in there, you know.</sentence><sentence id="163">And this is the place -- so it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military zone</span>, belonged to the army.</sentence><sentence id="164">And you could not go into any <span class="NPIP">place</span> in army during Soviet days.</sentence><sentence id="165">They agreed they" Il let us put up the monument.</sentence><sentence id="166">We -- We -- We a-agreed on a price with -- how much it'll cost.</sentence><sentence id="167">But it came the day when they're supposed -- already the monument is ready and they decided nyet, they're not allowed to on the mili-military.</sentence><sentence id="168">So, I -- finally it was ready, we are ready to go in 19 -- in 19 -- this was what, 60, now is 90 -- 98 and 96.95, we had a date and I had a group, the -- a woman from the local -- well, W -- WMG -- GME, I think it
