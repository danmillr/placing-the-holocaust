<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Can you first just tell us when and where you were born?</sentence><sentence id="10">Let's stop -- we -- I just heard the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: Right, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ginetta</span>, te -- can you give us your official date of birth, and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="14">Yes, I was born in -- near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, in a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Columbano Olumbro</span>, little f-fatsioni of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, now it's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, on June first, 1923.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: And can you tell us something about the life that you led before you got into the Resistance?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="18">Yo -- I know that it was a rather complicated and interesting time for you.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: It was complicated, and at some level, it was also a good life.</sentence><sentence id="20">And one of our circle of frien -- the circle of friend, the most important thing was the circle of friends we had, all anti-Fascist, and all active in assisting people who had been persecuted by the Fascist party.</sentence><sentence id="21">Yes, Jewish, but the Fascist party was also persecuting people who were anti-Fascist.</sentence><sentence id="22">It just happened that many of the anti-Fascist were also intellectual, and intellectual are more likely to be critical.</sentence><sentence id="23">Until 1938, it wasn't too difficult.</sentence><sentence id="24">Then, when the Nazi law were adopted by Mussolini, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, there was a great deal of criticism about Mussolini doing that.</sentence><sentence id="25">And yet, the discussion I vaguely</sentence><sentence id="27">remember, in our circle of friends, particularly when we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, climbed everythi -- if it was a day, that it was not very clear, they talked, they talked, they talked about political issues, social issues, anti-Fascist persecution.</sentence><sentence id="28">The general atmosphere was that even some intellectual had signed some paper approving of Mussolini adopting the Nazi racial law, and that was 1938, so I was pretty young, and to be very honest with you, there were times when I were -- yes, I was interested, but I wanted to climb, I wanted to hike, I wanted to sing, I wanted to have a good time.</sentence><sentence id="29">I was touched by it.</sentence><sentence id="30">At the same time, I also wanted to have a good time, going to look for ackenberry, for example, in August, and have ackenberry pies, and for -- in the <span class="INT_SPACE">refuge</span>, and -- or rather, I have never forgotten that the criticism of the Nazi law was not only done by educated people, but there were also a farmer who taught i-il pladoni, Mussolini didn't have much hair, so they called him il pladoni, he is crazy.</sentence><sentence id="31">He is doing -- you know, why is he doing this, why is he going after the Jews, wh-why is he doing that?</sentence><sentence id="32">And then, in the discussions, and as I said, I heard not only within my family, but also in my -- the circle of friends, who were personal friends, all interested in mountain climbing, all interested in going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugi</span> for hikes.</sentence><sentence id="33">Near the lake of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span>, there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Laigreenai</span>, and there were refuges where we went, and we had to carry our food in the back.</sentence><sentence id="34">Ex -- there were some supplies left there, brought by donkey, like polenta, rice, potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="35">But -- and the farmer would have milk, a -- etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="36">And then we would hike, and then the discussions.</sentence><sentence id="37">Yes, there was discussion of movies, there was discussion of <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, there was discussion of opera.</sentence><sentence id="38">There were discussion of work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">There -- but also, there were always political discussions, and invariably, we found -- at least I experienced the fact that people had joined the Fascist party because they had to work.</sentence><sentence id="40">Tha -- they were very few who would disagree, and -- and there were big discussions.</sentence><sentence id="41">"Hey, you stupido, cretino, that you believe in these idiotesa, that is -- we don't like the</sentence><sentence id="43">German."</sentence><sentence id="44">Well, I didn't like when they said, "I don't like the German," generally.</sentence><sentence id="45">I made -- and my parents taught me, and my friend taught me, then -- there has to be a distinction between the pro-Nazi and the German.</sentence><sentence id="46">And, there was a discussions, very early, about the fact that some German people, yes, they were Communist, and Socialist, but they were also member of the upper class.</sentence><sentence id="47">And some bishops, who, when Hitler began the persecution of the Jewish -- the anti- Fascist -- anti -- there were Communists, Socialists, and Jews.</sentence><sentence id="48">And it just happened that many intellectual were also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="49">At that time -- I was very young, but I remember the heated discussions about Hitler, as announced in the press, that he has opened a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, to put those people in.</sentence><sentence id="50">It was very difficult for young people to understand what it meant.</sentence><sentence id="51">The -- some of the friends that I had, who were older, mature, and who -- and my parents, they were aware of the Fascist party having a special tribunal, i-i -- where the Fascist didn't have <span class="BUILDING">courts of law</span> for those anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi -- f -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, was anti-Fascist, but you understand, then, they were against both.</sentence><sentence id="52">And instead of a <span class="BUILDING">court of law</span>, with judges, which of course many of the f -- the Fascist had nominated those people, but nevertheless, the special tribunal could condemned anyone, that when that person -- and there were women, too, became quote, suspect, the special tribunal had the special Italian Secret Police, called Ovra, O-v-r-a, to investigate the suspect.</sentence><sentence id="53">And I remember one particular day, when they were discussing this, we couldn't go up climbing, we couldn't go hiking, it was raining, and -- and they were discussing all this -- I mean, it sounds s-strange thing, that this suspect could be man or the woman, and then the Ovra could pull in, for interrogation, the baker, the priest, the butcher, friends, associates of the work, whether they were engineer, or doctor, or [indecipherable] and, I remember that they were talking about some people were killed, executed.</sentence><sentence id="54">Some people were sent to what was known -- oh, some people to <span class="BUILDING">San Vittory prison</span>, something, somebody sent to remote area in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, where</sentence><sentence id="56">these people who were intellectual, writer, artist, doctor or lawyer, could not see the family, except maybe once a year, twice a year, I can't remember correctly.</sentence><sentence id="57">But they were deprived of the mail, very rarely they could have the mail.</sentence><sentence id="58">They could only receive visits from the family very rarely.</sentence><sentence id="59">In other word, they were denied everything, and whether they were imprisoned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span>, or sent to these remote <span class="REGION">area</span>, there was the attempt to isolate them from society, deprive them of their professional life, their French -- their family, their friends.</sentence><sentence id="60">And the special tribunal had the power to do that, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">But the German, apparently, were doing the same, and again I didn't understand very clearly, except in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was a place, after 1933, where priest, Socialists, Communists, intellectual, could be sent, and the judicial system -- and they talk about the judicial system being damaged.</sentence><sentence id="62">The SS, and the Gestapo took over the function.</sentence><sentence id="63">That meant that it became very arbitrary, also.</sentence><sentence id="64">And I also remember that both in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and I mention, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, if some big Fascist liked a woman, sometime they had the man investigated, so -- you know, in other word, an arbitrary, unjust, terribly painful process for the fellow.</sentence><sentence id="65">Now, that picture of the special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>, those memory of San Vittory, the exiled, it remained with me forever, for as long as I remember.</sentence><sentence id="66">But at the same time, we -- there was a great deal of joy.</sentence><sentence id="67">There was <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the -- the hikes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, seldom we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">Occasionally we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paylee</span>, and I learned how to watch the <span class="DLF">farm</span> -- the fisherman to bring in the fresh fish, and -- and have a meal with them, they made the mayonnaise with the garlic, and the parsley, and I wasn't cooking at that time, but I watched them there, enjoyed the French eating, but <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> were the [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="69">Short weekend was [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="70">And, in addition to climbing, and we met -- we knew the Pastore, who had this wonderful bitar and then the cow, and they made the fresh cheese, and there was be -- song, in spite of the difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="71">Now, the people --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: It was what?</sentence><sentence id="137">I didn't --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Difficulties, in spite of the difficulties --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: There was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: -- there was joy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Joy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: And the mountain club, the Italian mountain club, was a social equalizer.</sentence><sentence id="146">There were intellectual, very wealthy people.</sentence><sentence id="147">Papa Bolla was the president of the Italian mountain club, the whole family, Leala, Rico.</sentence><sentence id="148">He was a businessman.</sentence><sentence id="149">The Sturani -- nobility, Count and Countess Sturani, and then the worker from the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">There were engineer, there were geometry impligati clerks.</sentence><sentence id="151">And, of course, we met th-the wifes, and the children participate.</sentence><sentence id="152">In fact, in one particular <span class="BUILDING">refuge Pialeral</span>, we built it.</sentence><sentence id="153">And we had to maintain it, and you had to walk, after you arrived with funicular above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span>, you had to walk for four hours carrying your knapsack, and as I said, in summer they had donkey that they brought durable goods.</sentence><sentence id="154">But otherwise, y -- and then you just roam around, and in winter it was skiing, but not the skiing of today, where you go up and down, up and down, can't stand that.</sentence><sentence id="155">Th -- the skiing was for sightseeing, for enjoy -- now, non-vacation was different.</sentence><sentence id="156">Then, we went to -- went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nash</span>, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbania</span>, and there was one funicular at that time, and we went up to anolder tel colostum becko, and that again was a reunion place.</sentence><sentence id="157">Summer was hiking all over, climbing.</sentence><sentence id="158">And I began climbing with my parents and guides.</sentence><sentence id="159">They were very strict about guides.</sentence><sentence id="160">You don't go up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> unprepared, because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, like the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> is very harsh, can be very difficult, so you have to be prepared.</sentence><sentence id="161">And then we refuge.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: What does that -- what does that mean, refuge?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Refuge -- refuge?</sentence><sentence id="185">Well, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> where you bring your supply.</sentence><sentence id="186">You melt the snow with Sterno, to make [inaudible], and you bring dry fruits, and a pinyotta.</sentence><sentence id="187">Pinyotta are dry cracker, but very hard on your teeth, you better have good teeth, or else you are in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="188">And, of course, the first day or so, you have fresh fruit also, but -- and, for the first day or two, you have slice of rosto polarose, but then you drive everything, and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="189">It was fun, it was climbing, it was hiki -- i-1 -- picotsa, if there was a snow, you use the ice pick, as -- la picotsa, I think.</sentence><sentence id="190">You had the scarponi, and so you go to refuge -- let's take an example, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shamoni</span>, this was not -- this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shamoni</span>, you go to -- by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span> you start hiking, I remember cutting it, sta -- to your refuge, le refuge de Ajohntierre, and you spend the night there, and the -- often the refuge can offer polenta, or zupa -- soup, or polenta, occasionally risotto, but really polenta is more [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="192">Also, they made, f-fontina [indecipherable], fontina toma.</sentence><sentence id="193">So polenta was fontina toma, all fresh, goat cheese, or fresh whatever there was.</sentence><sentence id="194">And you spent the night.</sentence><sentence id="195">And it's wonderful because there is a camaraderie, | think is the word.</sentence><sentence id="196">Easy.</sentence><sentence id="197">Young people talk, talk about <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and movie, talk about the love, talk about this, talk about that.</sentence><sentence id="198">The serious people talk about -- yes, some politics, or is -- Italian are very yeah, yeah, yeah, talk politics great deal.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="199">But, also talk about traveling, talk about culture, talking about booksa, talking about history, talking about the meaning of some opera, for example.</sentence><sentence id="200">And I remember in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span>, we're talking about a performance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> of Don Carlos, and how Verdi had a -- really used opera to express the essence of repression, a religious repression.</sentence><sentence id="201">The burning, the -- and then there were discussion over -- on religion, for example, because at that time, Voltaire was a prohibited author by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">So needless to say, we talk about Voltaire, and -- and also, the press was controlled.</sentence><sentence id="203">I must confess that at that time, I was far more interested in boys and girls, I was far more interested in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, far more interested in having fun, and I had a good</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="207">friend at that time, that I knew when I was seven, and he was 11, and he -- I heard all this, and I paid some attentions, but I must confess that my attention at that time, when I was so young, was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, in the fu -- wildflower.</sentence><sentence id="208">I was crazy about wildflower, I -- I -- we went, as family and friends, to do le narche zarta, which meant we went to the <span class="DLF">refuge</span>, and then we picked, very carefully, a bouquet of -- it's daffodil-like, but white with a little red, little eye, and very perfume, not cheesy.</sentence><sentence id="209">And you are taught conservation from day one.</sentence><sentence id="210">And again, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> you talk about planning.</sentence><sentence id="211">Let's go for a narche zarta in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Como</span> next spring.</sentence><sentence id="212">We take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">picnic</span>, we go.</sentence><sentence id="213">Some people work for <span class="BUILDING">Las meerbiscoza</span> for <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">What we discovered -- and while we were talking about fun in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, there was a great deal of politics all the time.</sentence><sentence id="215">Now, the best, active people, at the political level, were Socialist, and Communist.</sentence><sentence id="216">Anti-Fascist, many of them.</sentence><sentence id="217">And being Communist, but after having been in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of Mussolini with the Communists, they changed.</sentence><sentence id="218">They followed the lead of two people, that I didn't know, and I be -- who started a movement called jostitsia en liberta, the Rosselli brother.</sentence><sentence id="219">And they were talking about the Rosselli brother as having taught them how common -- hard line Communism of the Stalinist-Leninist type was as dangerous as Nazi Fascist, and therefore they wanted, yes, Socialism, yes, a just society, due process of law.</sentence><sentence id="220">That was taught by lawyer, like Enrico Enpigi all the time, Contamessa -- Rainso Contamessa.</sentence><sentence id="221">Due process of law, fair trial, and then -- and no military judges, like the special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">So there was this combination of hat -- la -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ajohntierre</span> was one.</sentence><sentence id="223">And then we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> sometime for two weeks, from refuge to refuge, refuge to refuge, and guides, always guides.</sentence><sentence id="224">But you have the leisure of enjoying something very much, with a diversified company, from student, and young children, to factory worker, engineer, lawyer, professor, doctors, a-academic, some very serious were very angry about the academician who had signed the Nazi manifesto for 1938 duration of Mussolini.</sentence><sentence id="225">And all in good</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="229">humor, even those who were accused of being -- you are a damn fa -- you are an Fascist stonase, c'est une cretino, c'est qui -- the next day we climbed together, we ate together, we -- you know, it was not vindictive, it was not nasty -- yes, there were bursts of recrimination, but it didn't become so sickening that hate, a -- hate --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Wh-Why do you think that was so?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: I don't know, to these days.</sentence><sentence id="232">Perhaps that question should be given to psychiatrists, or other.</sentence><sentence id="233">I believe then the Italian culture, with so many occupation, for centuries, by so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> -- you know, remember in <span class="REGION">Sicily</span>, the Swedes were there.</sentence><sentence id="234">In fact, there was a beautiful poem called, "Curradino dis vetsia."</sentence><sentence id="235">And I have never forgotten a small part of that poem.</sentence><sentence id="236">The poem referred to a mother, in switzer -- in -- in swede -- in sw -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">You see, in springtime, a swallow return, and the mother ask the swallow what coming -- was coming from ita -- from the south, "Dimi iveesto il filio meo," Tell me, have you seen my son, who was sent to fight in <span class="COUNTRY">Sicily</span>?</sentence><sentence id="238">And the swallow answered, "Si, no veesto, erabuendo, erabianco, sotolarko diontempio era saipporto."</sentence><sentence id="239">Yes, I saw him.</sentence><sentence id="240">He was blonde, he was white, under the arch of a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> he was buried.</sentence><sentence id="241">And I remember the discussions around that poem, and I've always remembered that poem because it emphasized the commonality of human being, but here it was from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> invading <span class="REGION">Sicily</span>, and then of course, we had the Berber invading, and the French, and the Austrian invasions.</sentence><sentence id="242">And each invader brought destructions, pain, suffering, but also the need for some people to get together and help each other.</sentence><sentence id="243">And I have a feeling that that common bondage of seeing so much suffering, and [indecipherable] destruction the pope's rector, in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> one must -- I mean, there were powers, and corrupt, and -- so ou -- in one sense you were devout Catholic, went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, you practice.</sentence><sentence id="244">You had also many skeptics, and the selling of the images, and all those things, were discussed, I mean, they talked about everything.</sentence><sentence id="245">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> was a</sentence><sentence id="247"><span class="BUILDING">teaching place</span>, because of the situation that here you are up in a <span class="DLF">refuge</span>, and you're having your time, but I don't [indecipherable] leisure to talk and think.</sentence><sentence id="248">Not that I understood very well everything, far from it.</sentence><sentence id="249">But it's amazing how later things seems to connect.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I remember when they were talking about the special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span>, the prisoner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span>, the persecution of the family.</sentence><sentence id="251">The injustice of having a judicial system with three military judges who had the power to bring in everybody to 1 -- to interrogate, intimidate, frighten friends, family, butcher, maid, you name it.</sentence><sentence id="252">And I thought, how can they do that?</sentence><sentence id="253">And yet, there was the other side of helper all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helper</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="460">A: The racial law, yes, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="461">I think when Mussolini adopted the racial law, it was a turmoil within the society, and also the special tribunal, the political pers-persecution.</sentence><sentence id="462">In the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span>, and in the confini -- confini are those people -- those <span class="NPIP">places</span> where people were sent, and I remember my parents, my friends saying, imagine if you're a doctor, a lawyer, a philosopher, a sociolo -- an intellectual.</sentence><sentence id="463">Also well as a worker who is organizing for the Communist party, or the Socialist party.</sentence><sentence id="464">They didn't persecute the [indecipherable] party, not very much.</sentence><sentence id="465">But those people are deprived of all contact, family,

id="467">Imagine being deprived of everything?</sentence><sentence id="468">And be isolated, and you haven't done anything wrong, you're innocent.</sentence><sentence id="469">And then when the special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> even sentenced people to death.</sentence><sentence id="470">And there were women, also, who had been condemned to that.</sentence><sentence id="471">Now, some women, I understood -- and again, one should do research on that -- I understood that some women were sent south, a-and they -- sometime they were hired by well-to-do family, as maid.</sentence><sentence id="472">But they were separated from their family, their children, their husband, who say, if you didn't -- if you stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you took care of me and the children, you did not have to worry about that.</sentence><sentence id="473">And some were kind.</sentence><sentence id="474">There are some cases where I heard that the woman who gave them the job, was very sympathetic, very supportive, very helpful, particularly when during the visit, the ha -- she saw the husband treating the wife, because -- if you stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you wouldn't have had this, and you have th -- you caused me so much grief.</sentence><sentence id="475">I have to cook, you caused your children so much pain, and blah, blah, blah, and she became very supportive of this exiled woman.</sentence><sentence id="476">Now, I don't know about the [indecipherable] cases, you know, one should look into -- into that, but it struck me once again human being are capable of great love, human being are capable of great caring, concern, and there are some who're not.</sentence><sentence id="477">And my feeling at the time, when I learned from my</sentence><sentence id="479">5 parents, from my friends, from the people I was surrounded with, was that it makes a difference if you're persecuted, and there are people who cares about you.</sentence><sentence id="480">And that began with a basket of roasted chicken, and thing that -- fruits -- and other -- than my parents, and other, brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and -- and also to people who are very poor, because there was a great deal of poverty at that time, and Mussolini was encouraging women to have a lot of children -- a lot of children to provide sons to go to war, essentially, cause he was always in t -- trying that, and -- and things were bad, but then, when Mussolini met Hitler someplace, I think it was the <span class="DLF">Brenner Pass</span>, and must have been close to the beginning of the war, maybe a couple of years earlier, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="481">Again, the propaganda was all in the hand of the Fascist [indecipherable] and the radio, there was no television.</sentence><sentence id="482">Osana about the alliance between Mussolini, and -- and at that time, the open hostility and contempt for the Jews, the propaganda began, to the point when Jewish people began really to es -- try to escape, to get abroad, to -- but what struck me was, when we went [indecipherable] within smuggles, and friends, and the biter, the Pastore, you know, the enormous compassion, and the enormous anger at wik Fascistoni -- there was -- were Fascistoni means big Fascist.</sentence><sentence id="483">Because before, many people had accepted -- they were against the alliance with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from day one, because of the memory of World War One, because when German and Austrian soldier were captured as prisoner, farmer family treated them well.</sentence><sentence id="484">Apparently, when the Italian prisoner of the German came back, they had horrible story to tell.</sentence><sentence id="485">I was too young, but I have heard from -- from -- one we thing that happened at that time, that has remained with me very vividly, about wars, the occupation, that I mention so many French, Austrian, Berber, Swedish, that si -- that the memory of the occupation by the Austrian was very vivid when I was a child, because after all, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> was occupied by them.</sentence><sentence id="486">The Aousta family, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span> -- regained <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span>, the Aousta family, in 1849.</sentence><sentence id="487">Then, in 1859, is when finally</sentence><sentence id="489">6 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span> was freed.</sentence><sentence id="490">You know, if -- andre dios is nothing in human history, but my parents took me to see a little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span> not very far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, in the <span

[indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="492">Then there is a <span class="DLF">grate</span>, and inside the <span class="DLF">grate</span>, there are bones.</sentence><sentence id="493">And the bones are the bones then the farmer founds, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Piedmont</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lombardy</span>, people who died in the war in 1848, in 1858 - deg59.</sentence><sentence id="494">And the farmer found so many, then they erected this little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> as a memorial to the people who died, but that memorial is a reminder that war is a horrible thing, and -- and people sometime bring matsolini di furey.</sentence><sentence id="495">If you pick up some poppy, and bachelor button, and -- you know, and it's a ca -- and then there is a -- a charo, there is a -- a candle, you know, those -- and then they put, and -- and this is done spontaneously, nobody is in charge.</sentence><sentence id="496">But my parents reminded me then, this was a way to remember those horror, and hopefully it doesn't happen again, but they also talk about Hitler, and Mussolini, but they also talk about Stalin.</sentence><sentence id="497">They felt that Stalin, and Hitler, but like this, Mussolini was considered a buffoon, less ideological, although he did put nula osta to the deportation.</sentence><sentence id="498">And it was not until after the war, when I met Angela Dinati, then we talk about the role of Italian Army of occupation in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="499">Now, already were -- throughout the world, there were letter coming from soldier Italian, in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, in <span

brought out, and everybody talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="500">It was like one of those telegram -- verbal telegram tree, then everybody -- no.</sentence><sentence id="501">Admittedly, the retay may have been difficult.</sentence><sentence id="502">An interesting thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="503"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had censorship, but many Italian censor made a point of passing some of the material to the anti-Fascist groups, and probably also to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="504">I only know the anti-Fascist leadership, Communist, or Socialist, parti</sentence><sentence id="506">7 [indecipherable], were recipient of those letters from Italian soldier who decried the horror of Italian being associated with the German in this horrib -- horrendous enterprise.</sentence><sentence id="507">It's against all the Italian history, culture, ence religious figure [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="508">And that's where the split in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">religious community</span> took place.</sentence><sentence id="509">And the ambiguity, and the lack of clarity, with the exception of some priests, who actually gave their lives.</sentence><sentence id="510">Norman Zofti, I think was his name.</sentence><sentence id="511">One priest in

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1300">A: They were very stupid.</sentence><sentence id="1301">Well, in general, you know, they were -- they were very -- they were expert in the art of

information, because people died, or people simply decided no way, I'm going to die anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1303">And one of the thing that must be said about the stupidity is, and for the first time, the SS and the Gestapo brought torture, not as an isolated incident, as the Ovra had used, or the police had used [indecipherable] any time, any <span class="NPIP">place</span>, anywhere, that is a systematic system of interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And it -- torturing people to obtain information which could be useful, became routine, and that was stupid, because they really tortured many people who didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="1305">And then they were hanging people publicly, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallows</span>, shooting them.</sentence><sentence id="1306">The other stupidity that they did, horrendous stupidity was -- not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, but abatsaboto, they caught -- there were something like 50 -- appro -- 50 - 54 partisan, including a pregnant woman, and they made that group travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and then they executed them all.</sentence><sentence id="1307">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liguria</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa spitsa</span>, there is another place where they took something like 40 or 50 young men, and publicly th-they executed them all.</sentence><sentence id="1308">And now, when I'm using the word stupidity, is because far from frightening -- yes, people were frightened, people are terrorized, but also people said, what?</sentence><sentence id="1309">Even many Fascists said, I don't want to be associated with this.</sentence><sentence id="1310">This is not <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1311">And true, with the Nazi, there were the Italian Fascist, SS, the

class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, when there is this kind of naked brutality, people will emerge, who will take far higher risk to help the victim than they had been willing to risk before.</sentence><sentence id="1319">And the reason I felt strongly about the underground press, although I'm not a journalist, but of course the Ritsini was a journalist family, pro-monarchy, I suspect possibly pro-Fascist in the early period, but certainly against this kind of brutality, and they were a great help in understanding that some conservative, from monarchy, etcetera, maybe proconserva -- they don't accept such brutality, and -- and had to -- had to the paper -- now, our workers -- thousand of people was to paste notices, and -- and oo -- at that time, we had to make -- to mix flour with water, and pinello, and go -- and that was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1320">And then distribute the clandestine press every <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could, in

point of view for arguing a case, for arguing a point, for arguing an essay, for arguing a book.</sentence><sentence id="1324">And between that, and assessing the press, evaluate it, analyzing it, and

have a recollection of any particular debate, or -- during this time?</sentence><sentence id="1331">Was there any --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1332">A: Yeah, oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="1333">The debate, at one point, centered around the role of people who had been part of the great concit of the Fascists, and then in July, turned against Mussolini, which caused, of course, the fall of Mussolini.</sentence><sentence id="1334">The role of the king, accepting to be emperor, accepting Fascism all those year, in spite of the terrible cost to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, to the Italian people, and what should be the post- war or -- of those people who had been Fascist, which of course, I believe that as soon as the Nazi came to power, tried to erase them, and executed some, like Galliazo Channo, and -- and other, or the king, for post war.</sentence><sentence id="1335">There were pro and con, and then debate about, so -- th-th-those were political discussion, and I have not been used to, and listen to people who had been professors and -- and student.</sentence><sentence id="1336">It was interesting.</sentence><sentence id="1337">It was a learning lesson in politics, for when -- I made up my mind that I would have never -- nothing to do with politics after world war -- I would have to do something with protecting human right, and freedom of expression.</sentence><sentence id="1338">And then the other discussion was about the slogan of the Communist, from the Ural to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1339">Is that what we want for Europe?</sentence><sentence id="1340">And the answer, a couple said absolutely, because they provide social and economic right.</sentence><sentence id="1341">Other felt like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> we want from the Ural to Atlantic, to have Stalinism, and Leninism, in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1342">Well, but the French wants that.</sentence><sentence id="1343">Well, the Italian don't.</sentence><sentence id="1344">Some did, but even the Italian who had been Communist, like Leo Baliani, and other, in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of Mussolini, changed, and decided it was not good for the Italian.</sentence><sentence id="1345">And in fact, no -- Ricardo Lombardi, Leo Baliani, Federucho Parray, they all agreed that the principle of socio-economic right is important, but so are civil and political right, and the two shall be linked.</sentence><sentence id="1346">And so the discussions was often heated.</sentence><sentence id="1347">Then there was a discussion about why should we accept funds from the American --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1351">3 from the allies, in the conduct of the underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, to assist prisoner, family, as well as assist the partisan.</sentence><sentence id="1352">The <span class="DLF">air</span> drops, also money from <span class="BUILDING">banks</span>, and from -- funds from the army left over, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="1353">We should have nothing to do with funding from the allies, or somebody said that we -- the Russian are sending tons of money for the -- for the Communist, for the propaganda, for everything.</sentence><sentence id="1354">So the discussion were often heated on that subject.</sentence><sentence id="1355">And our feeling was that we have to win this war first.</sentence><sentence id="1356">And then the political system that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> will have, will have to be decided by the Italian.</sentence><sentence id="1357">The most important thing we should ha -- must have, is a constitution.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1358">And so then there were the professor who -- who knew laws, and knew the -- then we read the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights, and oh, this is what we should have, and -- but the most thing -- everything agreed on no more dictatorship, and then brought into the question, what about the Marxist Leninist, that's a dictatorship.</sentence><sentence id="1359">Oh yes, but that is a dictatorship of the proletariat.</sentence><sentence id="1360">Does he allow freedom of expression?</sentence><sentence id="1361">No.</sentence><sentence id="1362">Yes, but he provides social and economic right.</sentence><sentence id="1363">Work for everybody, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for everybody, food for everybody, and my question was, at what price?</sentence><sentence id="1364">So, here we are -- sometime the bombs were also falling, and having this discussion.</sentence><sentence id="1365">But essentially I came away with a sense that open debate is crucial.</sentence><sentence id="1366">But personally, I will never tolerate any dictatorship, no matter what the justification is -- is given by a government, period.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And I didn't care if it was right wing, or left wing, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1368">Any government, then want to impose a dictatorship on their people, in as far as I was concerned at that time, does not deserve to be respected, or supported.</sentence><sentence id="1369">But to do that, you need the help of everybody to understand, to begin with, the danger, then this government represents.</sentence><sentence id="1370">And they will always find excuses, I mean, Mussolini was giving us all the excuses, Hitler was giving us all the excuses.</sentence><sentence id="1371">Hitler wa -- Stalin was giving us all the excuses.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And what was the result?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1373">Suffering for everybody.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1378">Q: Can you explain to me how, or what it was then, that made you say, I will never get involved in politics, but I will get involved in issues of human rights?</sentence><sentence id="1379">What -- what was for you at that moment, if you can go back there, wha -- what was it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1380">A: Well I realized that here were people that I loved, intelligent, dedicated, who truly believed that in the future, when the war was over, to obey the order of Stalin, for the good of the Italian, was essentialed to reveal our society in amoda, which would be different than Fascism.</sentence><sentence id="1381">I was unable to accept that.</sentence><sentence id="1382">The other was that there were some member of the Communist party began worrying about this kind of thing, and discussed this openly, and felt that the Roselli brother for just a salivita, and understood the danger that Marxist, Lenin, and Stalinism presented for society, we still wanted to change the socio-economic situation.</sentence><sentence id="1383">That was freedom, and not freedom of expression suppressed in order to achieve the other.</sentence><sentence id="1384">In fact, we felt at that time that Fascism was far more modern that Leninism -- Stalinist Leninism, and look what it has done.</sentence><sentence id="1385">We didn't know about many other things than Stalin had done, and we knew what the Nazi had done.</sentence><sentence id="1386">And analyzed, discussed, studied, compared, and all -- all the others were going to become part of political parties.</sentence><sentence id="1387">All of them became political leaders.</sentence><sentence id="1388">And it's okay, it's just that I felt there has to be voices outside of the political system, that you can say, I disagree with that.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And I remember -- I can't remember who said this, and then later on I heard it after the war many times.</sentence><sentence id="1390">I think it was Voltaire.</sentence><sentence id="1391">I disagree with you, but I'm ready to die for your right to disagree with me.</sentence><sentence id="1392">I'm not certain it was Voltaire, but that's what I thought at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1393">That's what we thought at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1394">I disagree with you, but I'm ready to die for your right to disagree.</sentence><sentence id="1395">And we felt that post-war Italy had to be respectful of ideas.</sentence><sentence id="1396">That there has to be a government which respect the right of citizen, and not imprison them, not torture them, not have mock trial, not have the special tribunal.</sentence><sentence id="1397">Special <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> was the tribunal than [indecipherable] Mussolini --</sentence><sentence id="1399">5 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ovra</span> installed during the Fascist period where there were three milary -- military judges, no legal defense, no -- entrapment was the -- the word for any suspect.</sentence><sentence id="1400">So, those are the idea that really consumed us, while we were all so activist in helping, in hiding, in pasting notices, or change slogan of the -- we knew then people were deported in <span class="DLF">railway tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1401">We were told that they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work.</sentence><sentence id="1402">And somebody wrote [indecipherable] Tedeschi, W. Tedeschi, and we will paint Abastoy Tedeschi, I mean, stupid things like this.</sentence><sentence id="1403">It -- it -- it was just perhaps childish, but we felt it was important, and boy if you were caught, you are shot.</sentence><sentence id="1404">You know, th- that kind of -- that distribution of mater -- leaflet press, and also learning to communicate to others, if there was a -- a danger.</sentence><sentence id="1405">The reason I made a copy of carla was because it's a classic example of somebody who undertake a very important project on that ha -- on that history, that also how somebody let him know then somebody was searching him, and instead of explaining, if you read it, you get it.</sentence><sentence id="1406">And -- and [indecipherable] translated into English, so that you can -- is an example of hundreds -- hundreds, and ordinary people doing kind of strange things all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1456">A: And then we also learned that sometime funds coming in from the allies, and distributed to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, was distributed to every group, but we also learned that the Communists were also keeping money for the post-war re-organization of the Communist party.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And at the time when you have such horror going on, and you need every penny to help everybody, I felt, my God, I am no different than the Fascist.</sentence><sentence id="1458">They are already beginning to accumulate money for power, for their control after.</sentence><sentence id="1459">And the slogan, from the Ural to Atlantic really made us uneasy.</sentence><sentence id="1460">Not just me, but Enrico Mullisanno, Pigi Mullisanno, Rainso Contamessa.</sentence><sentence id="1461">They were Communists who were queasy about it, but they still felt that they owed obedience.</sentence><sentence id="1462">So my response was -- and this was my response, obideerai -- craderai obideerai combaterai.</sentence><sentence id="1463">To believe -- to believe craderai.</sentence><sentence id="1464">Obideera, obey, combaterai, fight.</sentence><sentence id="1465">And I said, what is the difference when with the slogan of Stalin, and the slogan of Mussolini, and the slogan of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1466">Craderai, obideerai, combaterai.</sentence><sentence id="1467">And I said, we want a force [indecipherable] of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, which hopefully will reflect the freedom that every person is entitled to.</sentence><sentence id="1468">The respect, the dignity.</sentence><sentence id="1469">If you want to be a Communist, you should be a Communist, but if I want to be something else -- I respect your right, but you have to respect mine.</sentence><sentence id="1470">You don't imprison me if you are in power because I happen to have different view, political or religious, because we remember also the Inquisition.</sentence><sentence id="1471">And Italian history is replete with it.</sentence><sentence id="1472">One discussion we had in the underground about torture was then the -- actually the Empress of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, not herself, but on the advice of counsel, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had</sentence><sentence id="1474">7 abolished the use of torture to extract information, and I believe it was the end of the previous century, and yet, it was reinstated when the Nazi came, eliminating the judicial system, taking over the judicial system, and -- and using torture.</sentence><sentence id="1475">So, the discussion also centered about what the -- the Austrian had done at the -- the end of the previous century -- not that Maria Theresa was necessarily enthusiastic, but she accepted the advice of her counsel to eliminate tr -- torture, and then, as Hitler comes to power, the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> lose juridical prerogative, due to the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, and the judicial system, for political reason.</sentence><sentence id="1476">And then they bring it to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1477">And while cases of torture had always occurred, but this was systematic torture, and it was horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I mean, people -- the scream were heard in -- whether it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Biapaolocelli</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Torino</span>, La Camradeebeeasti, Aroust, every <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1479">It became an epidemic.</sentence><sentence id="1480">But we thought about the possibility of that under a dictatorial regime.</sentence><sentence id="1481">And we felt a dictatorship can use this method, as the Nazi, the Fascists are doing, any <span class="NPIP">place</span>, any <span class="NPIP">time</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1482">So in a post-war Italy, what we want is guarantee, and that will never happen again.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And we're thinking about <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

was in information, people who are work -- working to gather information useful to the allies in the war effort.</sentence><sentence id="2019">One of the key people in that accession of the SS, was named Hugo Osteria.</sentence><sentence id="2020">Hugo Osteria had been a policeman -- political policeman for the Ovra, the secret police of Mussolini, or the Fascists, throughout that period.</sentence><sentence id="2021">And when, after September eight, the -- he began working for the SS, and the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Vittory</span>, in the section specialized in -- in interrogation.</sentence><sentence id="2022">Besides Hugo Osteria, there was a -- a man, whose name was Franz, and he had huge dogs that he didn't mind unleashing on the prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2023">And another, Sawecki, something like that, s -- li -- Sawecki -- s -- I can't remember the spelling, Sawecki.</sentence><sentence id="2024">He was an SS captain.</sentence><sentence id="2025">Hugo Osteria was the interpreter for the SS, for the Gestapo in that particular <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2026">So, he approached the committee of National</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2030">2 Liberation, and said, "I want to help you."</sentence><sentence id="2031">So he would give us the name of the people detained in the particular <span class="REGION">area</span> if he could, and also to let us know what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="2032">Needless to say, we had other sources, mostly the suarai, the nun, the doctor, being careful, but was one.</sentence><sentence id="2033">The baker was another one who was very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2034">And -- but Hugo Osteria became important.</sentence><sentence id="2035">So, what he did was sometime he let people be tortured, deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2036">Among them was Jainjo Bamphi, the brother of Senator Arialdo Bamphi, a-and the husband of Mrs. Bamphi, whom I met, and she described that it was Hugo Osteria who arrested Jainjo Bamphi in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2037">So Julianna -- Julia Bamphi told me he played the double game, because he helps them, and he help usually important people, of the Committee of National Liberation, like Ferucho Parai, then later on, at the end of the war, would testify on his behalf.</sentence><sentence id="2038">But many other people, like Jako Perdenti, Cheenira Scapolla, and Jainjo Bamphi were not only tortured, but then deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, where they died.</sentence><sentence id="2039">And this was typical of this man, and other working for the Nazi and the Fascist.</sentence><sentence id="2040">Then they would give the Committee of National Liberation, and the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, information about certain prisoner, or arrange for money to be paid to somebody by some family desperate to get help for their prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="2041">But essentially, you never knew.</sentence><sentence id="2042">Certainly she never trusted them, and eventually the allies decided that this man was so unreliable that he had to be shipped in the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2043">And Bustelli told me how he -- he was a S-Swiss Intelligent Services, how he, personally felt for a long time than this man was a prototype of politsiato, political politsiato, never to be trusted, that he would give some help when it was possibly beneficial for him in the future, in the political settlement after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2044">But helped to arrest people, did a lot of damage, used informer, and unfortunately, because of the double game, managed to gain the trust of some people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, which led to disastrous results.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2045">Yeah.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2049">Q: I'm taking a break.</sentence><sentence id="2050">We're back from our break.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2051">A: But you can understand why I just don't want to [inaudible].</sentence><sentence id="2052">Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="2053">I wanted Hugo Osteria to be known as a skunk.</sentence><sentence id="2054">But we have also cristori, police chief, who were asked to keep their job.</sentence><sentence id="2055">It was very important than they stayed where they were.</sentence><sentence id="2056">They had access to curfew paper, so that people could say, I'm a doctor, I'm a nurse, I need to travel after the curfew is implemented, and were very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2057">One of the first thing when the Committee of National Liberation did was to have false identity card made for various people, Jewish, Catholic, the people working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, and -- so, there was this man, whose name was Joe Bacigalupi.</sentence><sentence id="2058">I don't know where he came from, except that he was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2059">Joe Bacigalupi work with the Committee of National Liberation, and he was a genius.</sentence><sentence id="2060">What he did, according to my friend in the Resistance movement, and I was the beneficiary of his work for our people, what he did was to say to the cristori, "Look, this was is going to be won by the allies, not by the Fascists.</sentence><sentence id="2061">If you help us, we will help you, and many other people."</sentence><sentence id="2062">Now, I don't know why they -- he needed help, I have no idea, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2063">What they asked him to do was to -- the underground asked him to ask the cristori for a list of the best forgerer, who had been either in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, or were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> because of forgery.</sentence><sentence id="2064">So Joe Bacigalupi became the number one specialist in doing forged document.</sentence><sentence id="2065">And was an enormous help, because we helped, working as cleaning people, <span class="INT_SPACE">cleaning floor</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span>, and other, for the Fascist, and for the German.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And because you are a cleaner, doing meaning job, they don't consider you a person who has hear, and -- you know, all what they knew was that we were cleaner, perfect beggar, peasant, and -- and they would talk quite freely around people, because they didn't think that we wa -- but among all, was to steal.</sentence><sentence id="2067">To steal some blank -- blank paper which were the koolfer -- call curfew for the lushapasari.</sentence><sentence id="2068">And that was very important, because --</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2072">Q: What i -- what is luss --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2073">A: Lushapasari means those papers, official paper that allowed people to travel after curfew was implemented.</sentence><sentence id="2074">But then it happen -- Joe Bacigalupi, and the team of forgerer, when they had this, then it was their job to duplicate, raticate, etcetera, and make it available, and there was some for the doctor, some for the people of assistance, and many -- false, of course, but the German caught on of that.</sentence><sentence id="2075">So every once in awhile, every two or three months, and they would change the papers.</sentence><sentence id="2076">So here we go, the cleaning lady, the cleaning ti -- di -- or boys, or whatever, and -- and we had to take some more, or sometime we worked as cleaning lady from some Fascist and onners, and get some more, but Joe Bacigalupi, and with the cooperation of the cristori, the policeman, whoever, he managed to get the list of all the forgerer.</sentence><sentence id="2077">He was best forgerer in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, and for other paper.</sentence><sentence id="2078">We were told at that time, that the allied in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had botched a job of duplicating false paper, which caused immediately the arrest of the two people who were carrying this false paper into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, so Joe Bacigalupi said, "Damn it, how stupid.</sentence><sentence id="2079">Those allies my have much money and all that, but they don't know how to do things."</sentence><sentence id="2080">And he was right.</sentence><sentence id="2081">Eventually he was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2082">Eventually, with the help of the inside guard, a key was left unattended, so that he could walk out at lunchtime when everybody was busy eating.</sentence><sentence id="2083">So this is some of my recollection.</sentence><sentence id="2084">And then of course, his paper were very important for people to bring to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and all people were sent from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2085">But then, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> too, we had a problem.</sentence><sentence id="2086">On one <span class="NPIP">point</span>, an infiltrator, I believe his name was Cherasa, but I'm not certain.</sentence><sentence id="2087">I believe so.</sentence><sentence id="2088">He managed to go into one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for Italian military, where he learned about plans by the allies, and -- to get people out, and he managed to get out and report to the -- San Vittory, to Hugo, and to the other group, what this Italian prisoner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swiss camp</span> were planning, how they were selecting specialists, be the kind of job then that Aurora did</sentence><sentence id="2090">5 in bringing back into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> these people to help in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, cause the ally needed help with specialists in demolition, for <span class="DLF">railway</span>, for <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, and so some Italian were very happy to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and help the allies to -- to do these kind of jobs.</sentence><sentence id="2091">So you needed people to be very careful in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because of infiltrator, like this Cherasa, who they managed to get out, and go to report to Hugo, and to these people.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And you needed specialists in demolition, se -- others.</sentence><sentence id="2093">But the reason I think about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aurora</span> was that here was a young woman in her 20, who gave her life to help.</sentence></p></dialogue>

underground activity was to organize people, sometime to go and evaluate the disaster made by certain destroy policy, by the Nazi in the valley, where we had so many partisan.</sentence><sentence id="2525">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdosta</span>, in particularly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoonage</span>, there was a very important group led by Usmiani, called the U16, Usmiani.</sentence><sentence id="2526">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buerkio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2527">Buerkio was the professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2528">And he had access to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, in fact, he personally often came on emergency, for instruction, also for training, for

class="ENV_FEATURES">valleys</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2530">That was normal.</sentence><sentence id="2531">But was also a center, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoonage</span>, for transmitting to the allies, informations via</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2535">6 these whom -- I didn't know who it was.</sentence><sentence id="2536">However, I was told that after the

the Committee of National Liberation saying why the Germans -- the Nazi are negotiating in oursta with the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and the representative of the partisan bands, or the truvalai, bartonunch, valdayass, dressonai.</sentence><sentence id="2537">They are actually already starting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> to go, and people dressed in camouflage, including some very cruel troops, already starting to catch the partisan on their back -- clean up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2538">So here they were negotiating in oursta.</sentence><sentence id="2539">The <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in good faith.</sentence><sentence id="2540">Tito, or ever, who is the commander of the Valtoonage did not go personally, as he was asked to do, but send somebody, because he sensed -- he smelled somebody.</sentence><sentence id="2541">So there was this frantic call, or communication from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdosta</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, to the Committee of National Liberation.</sentence><sentence id="2542">The information had come from -- I was told, from somebody who went to a <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> from our side, who heard either a Fascist or a Nazi woman, or mistress, or somebody saying, "Oh yeah, they are negotiating with the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, but they are going to clean up.</sentence><sentence id="2543">The German are already started."</sentence><sentence id="2544">Something like that.</sentence><sentence id="2545">So, immediately, there was this one page, frantic communication to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valdosta</span>, it was too late.</sentence><sentence id="2546">We lost a lot of people, it was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="2547">Many people were killed, and there was a traitor who was working right next to Tito.</sentence><sentence id="2548">And when the time came for this person to go and give the meecha, the fire to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, so then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> couldn't go, he killed the other person with it.</sentence><sentence id="2549">So -- and he had been with -- with us for three months and nobody realized that he was a double.</sentence><sentence id="2550">But this I confirmed with Monsieur Tiba, when I saw him.</sentence><sentence id="2551">And I spoke to Tito a few years ago about all this.</sentence><sentence id="2552">So, after this disaster, we lost a lot of people, including young people that we had send up, because they didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, they wanted to participate in the active Resistance movement, so we send them up to the banns.</sentence><sentence id="2553">And among</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2557">7 them a young man, Hoos Franco from either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maltarra</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pavia</span>, very close by, but actually, we were involved, our group was involved.</sentence><sentence id="2558">Soon after all this disaster occurred, I was told by a friend, member of our group, the Benedetti, who was a mountain climber, and his son was working with us, he wife was working with us, that it was very important to go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoonage</span>, and assess the damage, but more importantly, it was very important to go to the house of pierovono, one of the guide, one of the Alpinist, and only since last dega -- August, I knew -- I learned that he was part of this special group, like Lashincross, I didn't know before.</sentence><sentence id="2559">As far as we knew, we were all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, working.</sentence><sentence id="2560">And these gentlemen, these architect, would come and pick me up at -- sometime early in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="2561">He had all the permit, and he had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, he owned a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chervinia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2562">His name was architect Molino.</sentence><sentence id="2563">Never met him in my life, but I was supposed to be his mistress.</sentence><sentence id="2564">And, "But he's a gentleman, Ginetta, you don't have to worry, but we need somebody to go up with him, he own a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he has a perfect reason to see if damage was done, to fix it for the winter, and he has his mistress with him."</sentence><sentence id="2565">And the mistress was me.</sentence><sentence id="2566">And so jus -- lo and behold, here, in November come this gentleman, and kiss my hand, and I go with him, he had all the passes, everything.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And we arrived, traveling to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shationne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2568"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shationne</span> is right at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the Valtoonage.</sentence><sentence id="2569">And we stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2570">He was going to place his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> someplace in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shantionne</span>, and we had to carry the knapsack.</sentence><sentence id="2571">I ask my ri -- Lask him if I could take a little suitcase, he said, "Yeah, if you feel like carrying that plus your knapsack, go ahead," but, you know, I didn't bring, I put everything in the knapsack.</sentence><sentence id="2572">But we had to bring up some medicine, and we arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shantionne</span>, we go to this little bric and brac little store.</sentence><sentence id="2573">This wonderful woman, Delphina was her name, and we chatted amiably, and then this architect said to me, "Go ahead, because I will catch up with you."</sentence><sentence id="2574">Remember, I was in my teen, and he was probably 60, but he was much stronger.</sentence><sentence id="2575">So it was obvious that he -- well, I</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2579">8 didn't think much, but it was obvious that he wanted to talk to her.</sentence><sentence id="2580">Only in retrospect I figured all that out, but I didn't at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2581">And we went, and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoomage</span>, and -- at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this family, and it was a -- all of the women were in black, they were -- well, they broke down crying, because of the horror.</sentence><sentence id="2582">And one of them described to me how Franco died.</sentence><sentence id="2583">They killed several people.</sentence><sentence id="2584">In fact, about 10 years ago, I took a picture of the monument to those people, and we went, and then I realized that we -- we wanted to stay in val -- I wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valtoomage</span>, and he, no, no, we have to go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="2585">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chervinia</span>, and at the <span class="DLF">passage</span>, at the <span class="DLF">block passage</span>, there was Italian young Fascist.</sentence><sentence id="2586">Very energetic, very ideologically committed people, but he had passes, and they were passes from the Gestapo, the SS, or some authority, and immediately everybody was, oh, please let me help you, blah, blah, blah, and all kind, and -- and I thought, oh my God, you know, I -- I trust Benedetti, no -- no -- but at the same time, you are startled.</sentence><sentence id="2587">I never met this person, but he was kind.</sentence><sentence id="2588">We arrived at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I was so tired.</sentence><sentence id="2589">He helped me to take off my shoes, made a fire, and gave me something to drink, and -- and then I lied down and I slept for awhile, and then he woke me up, and he said, "We have to go."</sentence><sentence id="2590">And we went to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">house</span> owned by Pierovona in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2591">And we ha -- w-we had to retrieve some material, which we did, and I had to put them in my chest.</sentence><sentence id="2592">Then, next day -- then I went back to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- next day, I s -- had to say to the Fascist that were mocking me for being with such an old man, etcetera, etcetera, that the altitude was not good for me, I had to go back, and say, "Oh yeah, this old man is no good, but we are good, come with us," blah, blah, blah all that suns -- kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2593">But they were very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="2594">And I was going to walk down, but then they drove me down.</sentence><sentence id="2595">And at the val -- at the end, th -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shationne</span>, there was a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where I was supposed to stay.</sentence><sentence id="2596">When the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> keeper saw me arrive with this Fascist, he was as cold as one can be, he said he -- yes, he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but no food, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2597">So, well, I went to -- to the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2601">9 <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and about one or two in the morning, there were shots fired in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the glass fu -- so I went under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Until the day before, the -- somebody from the Fascist or the Nazi used this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2603">So the partisan thought then they were still there, but I was there, so I went under the thing.</sentence><sentence id="2604">And about oh, few minutes later, some partisan came in with the red ankle chafe, and the machine gun is -- "Where is she, where is she?</sentence><sentence id="2605">Oh my God, what we have done?"</sentence><sentence id="2606">They knew, they learned that I was there.</sentence><sentence id="2607">So, the face of hotel keeper changed completely.</sentence><sentence id="2608">He b -- the partisan actually, they said, libber, please give her some -- anything.</sentence><sentence id="2609">So he brought out cheese and wine and bread, and -- and apologized.</sentence><sentence id="2610">And then he put some coal in a scarbaletto.</sentence><sentence id="2611">Is a gadget with a long handle, and inside put the coals, so that his wife warmed up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="2612">I mean, it was such a change.</sentence><sentence id="2613">And we -- next morning, I came down and he gave me -- I realized he put something in my knapsack which was very good, cheese and a piece of meat.</sentence><sentence id="2614">I arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the <span

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> was surrounded, and -- and so that's how I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2628">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiranno</span> few days later, that

-- I brought <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> to the mouti, and I was told by a man whose name was Crome that I didn't speak, but they had the means to make me speak.</sentence><sentence id="2635">I didn't doubt it, but I -- but then they released me because somebody said then, oh no, no, I was not involved.</sentence><sentence id="2636">Two hours -- I was still black and

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span>, arrived.</sentence><sentence id="2638">And he said, "You are not working, so you have to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="46.168889" long="9.868889">Sondrio</span> to work for us."</sentence><sentence id="2639">And I said, "Well, I have an appointment with my doctor, because I have some problem with my lungs."</sentence><sentence id="2640">And, "Well, you go and see your doctor and then you come back with us."</sentence><sentence id="2641">So I went to the doctor, who was one of us, and the doctor meanwhile, had arranged for my friend, Enrico Mullisanno to arrive, and they said, "If you have the courage to do it, we would like you to -- to do it, to go back."</sentence><sentence id="2642">Well, once they arrived back, it was clear that it was a ruse, too.</sentence><sentence id="2643">And it was -- it's a long story, but the women of the Black Brigade were as bad as the men, and all of us remaining -- one was Bruno Bianci, whom I saw, and his wife was killed, the order came from Mussolini headquarter, from -- that all the people who may have been involved in Intelligence gathering -- and evidently they sus -- suspected that I was -- actually turnous, probably they were right, but I -- I didn't know -- they should be executed.</sentence><sentence id="2644">And what they did was to make a sign that you were there voluntarily.</sentence><sentence id="2645">They received a tremendous amount of brand new money from someplace, and they made a sign than they had given us all this money, when it was in fact they kept it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2646">And they wanted to interrogate me once again, which was, you know, it was the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2647">But there was something really cruel about -- not all of them, at the point they were ready to be bad, but not all of them.</sentence><sentence id="2648">Still holding on to this -- what they were talk about?</sentence><sentence id="2649">The special weapon that the German would use, and would win the war after all, except after April thir -- 23".</sentence><sentence id="2650">And they were talking about them, and</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2654">1 I was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2655">They didn't want to leave witnesses to what they had done.</sentence><sentence id="2656">It was very important that I give the name of all our people, it was -- so, they were trying once again.</sentence><sentence id="2657">When the telephone rung, and somebody said than the German wanted to talk to me again.</sentence><sentence id="2658">Well, everything was falling apart, but still they couldn't get it.</sentence><sentence id="2659">And they were very angry that they didn't dare to say no to the German, they still had an inferiority complex vis a vis of the German, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2660">That's my personal impression.</sentence><sentence id="2661">And -- and two people dressed in German uniform came in, and made jokes about these Italian sissy, that they fall down on the <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2663">And from there they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where the nun received me and helped me.</sentence><sentence id="2664">But I only learned later there were a number of people involved, not only for me, but for others, and German deserter was -- were asked to help.</sentence><sentence id="2665">To intercept the communication in case the brigatanari, the mouti, would check to see whether it was true, that you still -- no, they didn't trust anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2666">And so these people were risking their lives to -- to help us, to -- to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2667">And it was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bustelli</span>, and -- and Lydia that they were part of the organizing with the help, with the guardiri publicani.</sentence><sentence id="2668">The guardiri publicani were Italian who were called to serve.</sentence><sentence id="2669">If they didn't, their father, their mother, would be beaten up, so they served, but they were our allies.</sentence><sentence id="2670">So there was a number of people involved in rescuing last minute people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation cells</span>, because they knew that we would all be executed.</sentence><sentence id="2671">And so, for a couple of days, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, oh everything, you know, little broth, wonderful care.</sentence><sentence id="2672">And -- but for two days, I was hidden, and then one of the people from the underground in that <span class="REGION">area</span> -- that's another story, it's too complicated, but apparently I saved his life, and, "Torpelino, Torpelino," and then he came, and - - so then they brought me upstair and I was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2673">I was ca -- I had been cleaned up, and I was being treated, and I had wonderful care.</sentence><sentence id="2674">And then, I have to say, the Italian government did</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2678">2 something that every government today should do for the people who

to be for TB only, but we were rec -- put there.</sentence><sentence id="2680">And then, from there f -- until September, and then to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called San Martino di
