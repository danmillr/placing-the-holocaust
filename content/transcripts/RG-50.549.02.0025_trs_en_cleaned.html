<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Would you describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> as -- as --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: -- a strong community by the time that you are aware of it as -- as [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="128">Yes, I would.</sentence><sentence id="129">We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- in -- in the -- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="130">His name was Eli Munck.</sentence><sentence id="131">He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer for instance and the call of the Torah.</sentence><sentence id="132">He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish intelligencia.</sentence><sentence id="133">And I -- I'd like to say this, which many people forget.</sentence><sentence id="134">Th-Th-Th-The German rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because they were not hired by the community.</sentence><sentence id="135">Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors and to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to -- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own.</sentence><sentence id="136">But in Europe -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> particularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair.</sentence><sentence id="137">Each one of us had to pay a religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way.</sentence><sentence id="138">So the rabbis were very free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row.</sentence><sentence id="139">When I</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="157">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0025 7 was very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever in -- in -- in Jewish history of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who devoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the future of Judaism was in the youngsters.</sentence><sentence id="159">I -- I'd like to say one other thing that only occurred to me very recently.</sentence><sentence id="160">Th-The rabbis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did not urge the Jews to leave and I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck.</sentence><sentence id="161">Why didn't he say, "Go find yourself another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to."</sentence><sentence id="162">He never did.</sentence><sentence id="163">And it only occurred to me very recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed, you see?</sentence><sentence id="164">Do you understand what I'm saying?</sentence><sentence id="165">They couldn't say that or they -- or Hitler would have knocked them off in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="166">The rabbis were completely dominated by the state.</sentence><sentence id="167">And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state and <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn on you.</sentence><sentence id="169">You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did everything he said.</sentence><sentence id="170">But he didn't tell us to leave, you see?</sentence><sentence id="171">Think about that.</sentence><sentence id="172">Is -- it's really -- it's a revelation when that thought came to me.</sentence><sentence id="173">He himself left with his family, after awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn't tell us to leave.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: How did that revelation change how you thought about him or -- or shift how you processed the whole experience?</sentence><sentence id="192">Because certainly --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: That's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: -- his story, Rabbi Munck's story is something that you mentioned several times in the previous interview --</sentence></p></dialogue>
