<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Rabbi Weiner, when we finished up with your earlier interview, you were talking about after Kristallnacht, in December of 1938, you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and stayed with your sister for about a week, who was living there.</sentence><sentence id="2">What happened after that and at that point, did you know where the rest of your family was and did you have any contact with them?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My family was, my whole family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">My brother who had run away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> had also come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">My sister, as I mentioned before, had been working with the family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, so they were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My father was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">After, about a week or so after the Shiva, my father and I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and we were living in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we had lived before.</sentence><sentence id="13">We were searching the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we found the bullet which had killed my mother and we found everything upside-down, we put the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in order and we were living there and repairing as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="14">In addition we tried to emigrate and find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to emigrate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: And what were the results of that effort?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: We had written to several people before, but the answers were usually, we have no money, we have no <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we like to help you, but we can't.</sentence><sentence id="22">Now after Kristallnacht, which was on November ninth to the 10th, 1938 of November, we wrote again to these people and we told them about my mother and especially my father's cousin, who was living in Yorktown(ph), <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span>, if he could do anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="23">This time we got a letter from him, that he would talk to the member of Parliament in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and find how to get us special permission.</sentence><sentence id="24">And he would then send us what is called a landing card, that we were allowed to land.</sentence><sentence id="25">After a few weeks, we got this landing card.</sentence><sentence id="28">Now the question was to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">You needed first of all, permission from the German government and they would be there when we would pack our things.</sentence><sentence id="30">But first of all we had to get tickets to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">My father went to the Norstorchalloit(ph), which is a shipping company in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they said, since the Germans wanted us to take a German company, they told us they were all booked up for two years.</sentence><sentence id="32">We did not want to wait for two years, so my father went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> again and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> had that, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> had a connection with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British Airline</span>, with the British, not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airline</span>, with the <span class="DLF">British shipping line</span>, the Koolnot(ph) <span class="DLF">Whitestar(ph) line</span> and he met a man from there and he said he would get us passage to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">However, to get there, we needed first to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry boat</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span>, we would take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing cart</span> came, we gave it to him and he prepared us and he arranged for all the necessary things in order for us to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">We were traveling five people, my father, myself, my two brothers and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="36">But we needed money for the tickets.</sentence><sentence id="37">In order to do this, we had to sell our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">Now there was one woman, --__ woman, who the Nazi's had planted into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, she wanted to buy it.</sentence><sentence id="39">Of course she bought it with very little money, just enough money to pay for the tickets.</sentence><sentence id="40">So we had the tickets and we set our date, I mean in fact the date was set by the <span class="BUILDING">shipping company</span>, for May 31, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="41">On that day we would leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">Many other things happened between December and May, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="43">For instance, one thing which happened was in January, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="44">On the 18th of January, which was the Kaiser's birthday, before Hitler came to power, I got it, I was visiting a friend of ours, the family Greenberg(ph) and just about 10 o'clock I got a telegram which said, "Come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>."</sentence><sentence id="45">I didn't know originally from whom it came, but it came from a friend of mine who was working with a Jewish organization, the same I had been working for and I knew that I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and go to this organization.</sentence><sentence id="46">He said to me, my, the family I was working, I was visiting, said to me, "Go there</sentence><sentence id="48">right away."</sentence><sentence id="49">So it was 10 o'clock in the evening, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going at 12 at night, so I took that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">But it was a very uncomfortable trip because there were the Nazis walking in and out and I didn't want to be recognized as a Jew at that time, so I walked around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">It was what we call a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">express train</span>, where there is a <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> at the side and then there are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> in there.</sentence><sentence id="52">So next morning, about seven o'clock, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, it wasn't my first time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">It was a very rainy day and a dark day and I just started to walk.</sentence><sentence id="54">I came to the Brandenberger(ph) <span class="DLF">gate</span>, which I had not seen for, at all, only in pictures before and there was a sign that Jews enter this at their own risk and Jews are forbidden to enter this, but I walked very quickly through, there was no one really watching me and I walked to this place of our organization, I came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and I saw some friends of mine, they said yes, thank you for coming, we are waiting you, the Nazis have told us that if we make out certain affidavits, which were fake of course, that our friends, young people you see, would have a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, to the <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> and they would go there on Hashera(ph), Hashera(ph) means preparation for emigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Then they would recognize us and they would go there.</sentence><sentence id="56">So the whole day we were typing out, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">type machine</span>, of course they had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric typing machines</span> at that time, we were typing out letters with names and birthdays and we said that they had permission, they were accepted to the Hashera(ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, I still have some letters in my files, and we gave them to the Nazis, about 200 people or so were freed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they came out.</sentence><sentence id="57">However, not everyone of these 200 people or so survived, because afterwards the Nazis conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and you see and then they came into their hands, but some of them might have.</sentence><sentence id="58">So that was in January.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Now, I want to ask you a few questions about what you've just described.</sentence><sentence id="100">First of all, were you at this point, supposed to be identified as a Jew, did you wear a, were you wearing bands?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: No, no, they didn't have this, only in 1941 they made them, they made them wear the yellow star.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: And in terms of this operation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, what was this organization?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: It was a Jewish organization called Agoutis(ph) Israel and they were trying, like everyone else, trying to get Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="111">Sometimes you could find a Nazi who was a little bit softer and her would accept such a fake document, you see they knew that it was fake, everyone knew it was fake, because especially the <span class="REGION">South American countries</span>, <span class="REGION">Latin American countries</span> were working very much with fake and with money, bribes and so forth, because I went to the South American diplomats very many times and they said to me, "Give us 400 dollars or so on, so much and we will let you out."</sentence><sentence id="112">So I went, oh we don't do it, go to that company, to that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they were all working together.</sentence><sentence id="113">Many times that's what happened and you know this from your history, people went out and they were not permitted in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because they said we don't, these are illegal certificates, and they had to be sent back, like it happened with many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">But the Nazi's were very smart and they recognized the Jew, as I mentioned once before, in the class you see, either by the nose, or by the ears or by the color of the hair or by the form of the head, because they measured them all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: This organization that you were working with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, was this in place for years, was this an outgrowth of political organizations you were involved with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: No, they had nothing to do with politics, actually.</sentence><sentence id="123">They were more or less a Jewish ____--s more, I would say more religious kind of organization than another kind of organization.</sentence><sentence id="124">But all organizations tried somehow to bring their members or to bring Jews out, because I can tell you, later on when I, all right, that comes later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: Were you, my question is, were you affiliated with this organization or similar organizations, years before?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="134">I was already, I was already affiliated with this organization since 1934.</sentence><sentence id="135">They had such an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, where I was living at that time, you see and it was at first a Zionist organization with which I was affiliated, however, I separated from them, because of religious reasons and then there was a special teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, who taught us, a Hebrew teacher and he was from this organization, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agoutis(ph</span>) <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I joined him.</sentence><sentence id="136">So I was already affiliated with this organization.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: And in 1934, what was the basic theme of the, the focus of this organization?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: The focus was to work for the Jews to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, mainly at that time, you see and also religiously, to make an organization where the people, where the Jews especially, became more religious instead of assimilation.</sentence><sentence id="144">It was a question of assimilation.</sentence><sentence id="145">It was a question of assimilation, emancipation.</sentence><sentence id="146">That's why the Zionist organizations, they were more of the type of uniting with the others and of so forth, where as this one was more individualized, by themselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: And you felt that was important?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="154">Because as I had mentioned before, I said to the teacher when they changed this, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days, from Saturday, from Shabbat, I said to him that I don't want to come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more on Shabbat, because I want to become more Orthodox, like the Germans want to become, in quotation marks, more German.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: And this was your, this was really your own past, not your family's?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: No, because my father was, was not as religious you see, as my mother and my mother came from a religious family you see, but my father did not keep all the laws, but he was just Jewish</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agoutis(ph</span>) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, was there any risk to what you were doing or was this basically authorized?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: It was not legally authorized, but everyone did it and the Nazis knew about it was be done, because the Nazis were interested at that time just to get the Jews out, until in 1941, when they had the final solution, you see and they didn't want them to _in there, they said, "The world does not take them, the world does not want them."</sentence><sentence id="165">As long as they saw a letter, you see, that another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was taking them, that was enough for them and they would sometimes, not always, let these people go and go there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: When you say you were able to help, maybe, a couple hundred people...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: How, how were these people chosen from where they, from where did you find them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: They were no lists, however we had friends and we knew from our organization, let's say my organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> at that time, I know names and besides is they had names, each one has names, each one of the people has some names, so they gave them the names and if people gave them different names, if friends gave them friends names, a friend, a friend, a friend, you see.</sentence><sentence id="175">So that's how they were choosing them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: So you helped whoever you could?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Whoever, yeah,</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: And how did you know that somebody was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> or somebody was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, or wherever?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: These people sometimes wrote.</sentence><sentence id="183">If they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>, it say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">Or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">They wrote and at that time, we knew where the people were, besides this, as I can tell you later, I had some contact with the Gestapo and they told me that, "We have people here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>," and so forth and forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: How long did you work with Agoutis(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: I only stayed there one day, however in this one day, you see, we did a lot of things, because on this one day, we wrote all these letters and we brought them to the, to the Nazis and they let them go, most of them.</sentence><sentence id="196">And then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">I was still in contact with them afterwards, but this was a deadline, I think this 18th of January was a deadline that they gave us, so we came on that day and made it all final, in one day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Busy day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: So you went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">Now one day it happened, we were always afraid, especially at nighttime that they may knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and take us away and it happened one day, I think in, also in January one day they came, an ominous knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="209">My brother who were, had, one of my brothers, who had remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and they had sent him to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">First he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>, somehow, they arranged with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, I don't know who, how, but he was in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">So one night, they knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I made myself not known, but they continued knocking and I said, "What can I lose?"</sentence><sentence id="212">I go downstairs, I open up.</sentence><sentence id="213">I didn't want to disturb my father, so I went downstairs, I opened up and he came in, not in Nazi uniform, but in plain uniform, civil uniform and he said to him, we have here a search warrant for your brother, Benu(ph), his name.</sentence><sentence id="214">I said to them, "Don't you know that he is in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="215">He made as if he didn't know anything, see, but come in and look through.</sentence><sentence id="216">They came through, they put upside-down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and this and they're all corner and then in the end I said, "You should have known that he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="217">He said, "Yeah, excuse me" and they left.</sentence><sentence id="218">But they came in and they made a person scared, you know.</sentence><sentence id="219">They could always come in,</sentence><sentence id="221">middle of the night and knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">I went every morning, about six or seven o'clock, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, which was about, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, 15 minutes away, 20 minutes away and sometimes Nazis saw me, but I didn't mind.</sentence><sentence id="223">So this was 1939, in January.</sentence><sentence id="224">In February, the congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, the Jewish congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, organized itself again and they had a temporary president, vice-president and, but they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> any more to live, so there was this one family, I mentioned before this family Greenberg(ph) that was a different, a brother of this Greenberg and they had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and they had already left this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in September 1938 and they had sold it, not even sold it, they had given it as a donation to the Bremen congregation.</sentence><sentence id="225">I met him later on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">But this was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and there were maybe 20 families living in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now, besides that's the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the congregation, was also in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we organized it.</sentence><sentence id="227">So we re-organized it, the congregation, you made a few things.</sentence><sentence id="228">Number one, I worked with the HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and made translations, I knew a little bit of English, not too much.</sentence><sentence id="229">Number two, we organized some courses for women in sewing and other things like this.</sentence><sentence id="230">Number three, there was a neighborhood congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weisaminda(ph</span>), which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven(ph</span>), that wanted some people to come and talk to them, so I went there sometimes and talked to them.</sentence><sentence id="231">Number four, we wanted to make a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> again because the children did not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">I can speak about this later.</sentence><sentence id="233">And, besides this, number five, they wanted a person from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> to be acontact _, going to the Gestapo maybe once, twice, or maybe three times a week and tell them about what was happening in the congregation, so I

Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="686">A: There were Jews and non-Jews, but there were a number of, a great number of refugees, because we found out later on there were some refugees who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and to, we, they also went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, because this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and, and my family still had contact with them after they had left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="687">So we left at three o'clock, I even made a poem about it, May 31st of 1939, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was clear and <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> fine, to make believe here governs right, but it was not so.</sentence><sentence id="688">So we went on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and it was supposed to be 10 days to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, but it took 14 or 15 days because in summer, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> goes further north and that's a shorter way, supposed to be, on the globe, but about in a few days later, we came into the section of the icebergs, because we went too far north and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was standing still for two or three days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>, in the <span class="REGION">Atlantic Ocean</span> and we saw many things, we couldn't go up any more, because there were fish jumping over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, all right, that's not of importance, but we were all a little bit seasick, not as much as on the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> and then we came to, finally, passing by <span class="REGION">Labrador</span> and ...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="691">3 Tape 2</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="692">A: I just talked about our trip from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and that we were kept for three days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>, because of nearing the icebergs.</sentence><sentence id="693">So finally we came to, past <span class="COUNTRY">Newfoundland</span>, <span class="REGION">Labrador</span>, we came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saint Lawrence River</span>, the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, to bring us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">We first stopped in <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Quebec</span>, someone came to the, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in, from a Jewish agency and told us that he would expect us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and then bring us directly to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">Now most of the other Jewish people who were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, knew where they would be going, they knew they would be going to relatives whom they knew already, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, or not far away.</sentence><sentence id="696">And these relatives would be there to expect them and they would be arriving.</sentence><sentence id="697">The trip on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saint Lawrence River</span> was a very wonderful trip and we enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="698">Continuing, we came finally to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, but the trip was very slow and instead of coming there in the afternoon as we had expected, we came there in the evening about nine o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="699">And there is a certain regulation that if a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> comes to <span class="DLF">port</span> after nine o'clock, I don't know if this is in all <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, but were there, if a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> comes after nine o'clock, then the passengers can either depart, go off or stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> until the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="700">The others, most of the others had relatives waiting there, but we didn't know anyone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and so we preferred to stay on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="701">Next morning, we got ready to disembark and the man came again from the, from the JIAS, it's called, the Jewish Immigrant Aid Society and he said to us he would take us and he would first bring us to a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, not <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, to a little <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> for breakfast and then he would bring us straight to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and where we would leave by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="702">Our destination was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yorktown</span>, <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span>, that's where our cousin was living.</sentence><sentence id="703">However, it was a Friday morning and we wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> if at all possible, at least over the Sabbath and we asked him, so he said no, that can't be done, because we have strict orders from the Canadian government, that all the refugees, greenhorns, they are called at that time, greenhorns,</sentence><sentence id="705">4 I don't know from where the name greenhorn comes.</sentence><sentence id="706">Maybe green as the _is green.</sentence><sentence id="707">So what happened?</sentence><sentence id="708">So the greenhorns have first to be, have, cannot stay where they want to stay, they must go to their <span class="NPIP">destination</span>, because there's an affidavit that these people guaranteed that they would take care of them and the government will not take care of them, the Canadian government did not want to take care of them, they just wanted them out as much as possible, because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> was not so friendly to the greenhorns, because I know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, where people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were sent to and stayed there for many years.</sentence><sentence id="709">Okay, so my father and we, and we children, all left and he brought us to a small <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and we had breakfast there and then he brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">Now the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> at that time was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Canadian Pacific Train</span>, railroad company I think it was and it was a small <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, I wouldn't call it more than a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="711">It was a small <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and it was in June, on June 15th and it was very hot in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, we never had such heat before in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was very hot and winter's very cold, summer's very hot.</sentence><sentence id="712">And we were sitting there and he, I don't know if he gave us a ticket, or somehow we stayed there, it was about 10 o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="713">So we thought of how, what can we do in order to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, so we remembered one thing, that we had written to relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, my father had a cousin from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ekatarinaslav(ph</span>) in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, who was a tailor and who had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> and we had written them, but the letter had come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, addressee not found.</sentence><sentence id="714">So we said, maybe he's, he's still living there, my father said and he was sure that he was still living.</sentence><sentence id="715">Maybe we can find out, but how can we find out?</sentence><sentence id="716">So about 10:30 I think it was, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and two nuns came in, because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> is Catholic, you see and two nuns came in and they put on a light and the light said, traveler's aid.</sentence><sentence id="717">So my father said, "Maybe these nuns can find out if this family's still living here."</sentence><sentence id="718">So he went over to the nuns, but the nuns didn't speak English and we didn't speak French.</sentence><sentence id="719">So what language are you speaking in.</sentence><sentence id="720">So they knew Russian, my father</sentence><sentence id="722">5 spoke Russian to them and he told them that we think there is a family living here, if they knew that we would be here, they would certainly take us in and we wouldn't have to go to Yorktown(ph), <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">So the nuns said, but what's their name?</sentence><sentence id="724">Said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaplan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="725">There are many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Kaplans</span>, come to find out, Caplan with a C, Kaplan with a K. What's the first name?</sentence><sentence id="726">Burr(ph) Kaplan.</sentence><sentence id="727">What's his profession?</sentence><sentence id="728">He was a tailor.</sentence><sentence id="729">What's his mother's, his wife's name?</sentence><sentence id="730">Bebe(ph), I think.</sentence><sentence id="731">So they came and they took the telephone book I think, or address book that they had at that time and they went through it and they called up all these people and they called up and people came to the the phone and they said, no, I'm not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ekatarinaslav(ph</span>), I'm not a tailor, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="732">So they called up 15, 16 people, then they called up someone and there came a young boy at that time, of my age, from the phone and he said, I don't know, but I'll call my mother, so he called his mother, his mother says, "Yes, my husband's name is Burr(ph), he's a tailor, he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ekatarinaslav(ph</span>), what are you calling about?"</sentence><sentence id="733">They said, "There are some people who are claim you are relatives and they want to talk to you."</sentence><sentence id="734">Okay, so made my father talk to them and my father right away recognized him, he seen him, he, not he, his wife, they hadn't seen each other for, at that time I mean, 15, 20 years and she said, "What?</sentence><sentence id="735">You're here?</sentence><sentence id="736">I have a son who is a pharmacist, his name is Jackie, so I call him and have come right over and we take you into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="737">So we waited about 15 or 20 minutes and then he came and he came and he took us all and we went to, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Kaplan's</span> and we stayed there for a few days and in the mean time we did not go to, to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="738">But, what happened was this, in the mean time, about 11 o'clock, we had received a telegram, I don't know how it came to us, it came to the JIAS, probably, because the JIAS had sent them a telegram that your refugee, your family is here and we are going to send them right on to you, so they had sent a telegram, Western Union, I still have the certificate and they said to them, "Stay where you are, we cannot support you here because we had droughts for several years."</sentence><sentence id="739">They</sentence><sentence id="741">6 were farmers and I was supposed to be a farmer and the young fellow at that time, who was about my age, I would be his farmer, you see and I never had seen the family, just recently, last year only, I met him.</sentence><sentence id="742">Now he is 72 years old.</sentence><sentence id="743">At that time he was 20.</sentence><sentence id="744">So what happened is, stay there.</sentence><sentence id="745">So he said to us, the man from the JIAS said to us, that doesn't matter because he promised to let you stay there and the Canadian government made us promise them that we will send them all back there, but this is____ how we stayed there, through <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, because the __ out about it.</sentence><sentence id="746">I don't know what happened to the tickets, but we stayed there, so we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

months, you can reapply."</sentence><sentence id="1326">1 So I reapplied again after six months and the situation got better, then I got the FBI to help me and finally, in 1945, I got what's called first papers.</sentence><sentence id="1327">At that time there were first papers and second papers, now you can right away become a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1328">Anyhow I had to wait five years in between and then in 1951, I became a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1329">When I became a citizen, I changed my name.</sentence><sentence id="1330">Why did I change my

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1637">Q: You don't have to be so close to the mike, but you keep turning your head away from it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1639">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1640">During the war, that we were considered enemy aliens, despite the fact that we were saving, they were not, they did not make a differentiation between those who came here because of their own personal persecution and those who were actually went along with the Nazi system.</sentence><sentence id="1641">They didn't make any difference here, they just considered everyone who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the same category, the Japanese too.</sentence><sentence id="1642">That was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1643">And then, afterwards, I mean the McCarthy hearings and so forth, the un-American committee, see that it's not American again, not too much American.</sentence><sentence id="1644">I mean that was a, a leftover, I would say, from what the thinking was here in the beginning of the 40's.</sentence><sentence id="1645">Is means that they very much believed in, in pure American and anything which came from outside of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, like <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and the Communists and so forth, was considered, you cannot live with it and you have to fight it.</sentence><sentence id="1646">So I think, but then the people understood that the most important here is actually to do something for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, when Kennedy, when Kennedy came.</sentence><sentence id="1647">I don't know if this is the right answer, there is no right answer to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1657">Q: That's okay.</sentence><sentence id="1658">I'm just sort of wondering if there were certain events over the years that had a very unusually strong impact on you and, or that you identified with or that made you think in a new way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1661">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1662">All right.</sentence><sentence id="1663">At one point, at one point I could have gotten a job, I was even offered a job already, in <span class="REGION">Portland Oregon</span>, I was offered a job, in 19, 1956 and I got the contract in and everything like this and I thought everything would be okay and I would be able to do this, to go there, to start a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and certain other things and I discussed it with some of the friends here and some intelligent</sentence><sentence id="1665">0 people, if this is <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that's reliable, if I can believe it and they said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="1666">But what happened is, I made already arrangements for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to go there and the condition was, my condition, that I would go there for three months on trial and if I like it, I stay, if I don't, and fulfill the complete contract, if not I would come back.</sentence><sentence id="1667">But just the day before I was leaving, I was told that they changed their mind there and they don't want to make a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, they want to make some kind of a social program or who knows what there and I had already given up my job, which I had here.</sentence><sentence id="1668">I had two jobs, I had the job in the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and I had the job in the <span class="BUILDING">burlap factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And fortunately, the <span class="BUILDING">burlap factory</span>, they took me back right away, even though I had canceled with them, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> did not take me back, but I didn't mind and the Portland, the one who had signed the contract gave me 50 dollars, which was not very much for the whole contract, which they signed, so then I decided, I'm not going into this <span class="DLF">field</span> any more, because you cannot believe them and I wanted to go on something which was safer.</sentence><sentence id="1670">Then I found out about the city of New York and I went into the Social Work System with the city of New York.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1685">Q: Why did you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1687">A: Because Kennedy, in his speech, especially the first speech we'd seen, don't do what the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> wants from you, do what you can do for your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you see, that people should work more for each other instead of against each other and always expecting things coming to them, you have to in, put some input, you have to do something and I wanted some input also, not all, that's why I wanted to make my own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my this and all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="1688">Some input, not just just on the receiving end.</sentence><sentence id="1689">This is unfortunately, naturally, people like to be served, but that's not how we can build up something.</sentence><sentence id="1690">So that's just the kind of input, and when I came here, for instance, that</sentence><sentence id="1692">1 <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, they didn't have a certain class, so I instituted a class there.</sentence><sentence id="1693">When I came here, they didn't have a certain kind of information sheet, so I instituted an information sheet.</sentence><sentence id="1694">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span>, they did not have a newsletter all the time, so we instituted a newsletter and___ to the ____ and we told them some stories about, I would like some input.</sentence><sentence id="1695">Giving something see, more giving than taking.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1711">A: You can never feel 100 percent safe, you can only, as an actual thing, you cannot be safe.</sentence><sentence id="1712">In your <span class="NPIP">mind</span> you can feel safe.</sentence><sentence id="1713">You can say, I have done what I do, what I've wanted to do and I have done this and that's how it will go, it will be, it will be.</sentence><sentence id="1714">Things may change, things change all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1715">The only constant in this world is change.</sentence><sentence id="1716">So it will constantly change and I don't think that anti-Semitism will ever stop.</sentence><sentence id="1717">Because I see it, whether it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, whether it's all over, you see, there are always people who are very self-centered and they want just what they want and they do whatever is necessary in order to get what they want without thinking about other people, hurting other people or harming or killing other people.</sentence><sentence id="1718">So therefore, I can only feel safe in the way, what I'm doing.</sentence><sentence id="1719">If you believe in a certain <span class="NPIP">thing</span>, you believe in this and then you feel safe.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1767">Q: But I suspect you had no idea what you would learn later.</sentence><sentence id="1768">That must have been somewhat shocking to you, yes?</sentence><sentence id="1769">I mean what would you, when you finally learned what really happened over there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1773">A: You cannot always think of the worst, you, you think something will happen you see, how much will happen, I don't know and then you have to be guided, like I did, by some principal which is basic, by some basic principal which you believe by.</sentence><sentence id="1774">If someone has a belief, then he knows something, then he, then he, then he feels safe.</sentence><sentence id="1775">If someone had religion, for instance, he says, this is what I can do, so much I can do and not more and the rest I may, I may leave up to God or someone else.</sentence><sentence id="1776">I can do only my best, what I can do and every person's limited, can only do certain thing.</sentence><sentence id="1777">So I will try my best.</sentence><sentence id="1778">But then you really have to try your best.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1785">Q: But I think what I was asking is, when you got tangible information about the atrocities in Europe, what was the impact on you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1787">A: I felt very bad about what was happening and I felt that something had to be done about it and the question, who could do something about it and how can you help, but it is not up to one person,</sentence><sentence id="1789">3 it has to be a group of people and before you change any person's, before you can change any person, before you can ask any person to help you, he has to have in his mind that he wants to help, really.</sentence><sentence id="1790">So you have to find out what is in his mind, you know and by talking to them and how bad it is.</sentence><sentence id="1791">Many people didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1792">And I see it many times, there are still people today who don't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1793">People only believe it if it hurts themself, if it hits themself, hits them or their family.</sentence><sentence id="1794">So therefore, I think the most important thing is education and therefore I was always in the <span class="DLF">educational field</span>, I wanted to be in the <span class="DLF">educational field</span>, because the work education means to bring out ____.</sentence><sentence id="1795">Not revolution by force, but to bring it out for other person, every person has something unique in themself, which other person doesn't have and bring this out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1859">A: I know one thing, that, I was the first born in the family, you see and usually the first born, gets more attention from the parents, like in my case and they sent me to a school of higher learning and they gave me piano lessons training.</sentence><sentence id="1860">Not my sister, she always complained about this and so, so in</sentence><sentence id="1862">5 order to give them a kind of feeling you see, of a little bit more than someone else, because like honoring your parents, you respect your older brothers and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="1863">But I didn't take advantage of it.</sentence><sentence id="1864">Probably it made me feel a little bit, a little better, I don't know, you see?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1881">A: As you know, my wife doesn't want to have any connection any more with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and ____.</sentence><sentence id="1882">I say, there were certain things in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which were very nice, you see and we would, and I would like to see it, I would like, let's say, for instance, go back and see where I was born and where we used to live.</sentence><sentence id="1883">In fact we once went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, since, since we immigrated here, but that was only one day, but I don't know what the German mind is now, but I remember one thing, that after the war, our neighbor, non-Jewish neighbors, wrote to my father a lot and they and I still have the letters, in German, that they were good friends and they are sorry for what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so forth and of course they wrote, also said, they suffered a lot, but that's not comparable to what the Jews suffered, because anyone else, even I tell most of the young people, too, anyone else who suffered, if he would accept the Nazi policy, would not be persecuted any more, Jews were persecuted whether they did or not and it was a purpose, so therefore I'd like to know, what the German attitude is now.</sentence><sentence id="1884">When they asked me this question in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, you see, how I feel, I ask them how do you feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1900">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1902">Q: Besides the fact that she's a lovely, wonderful, woman, was there a certain commonality, a certain bond that you felt because she was also a German?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1904">A: No, because I met her when we were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, she did not remember this, but I did, do.</sentence><sentence id="1905">Because when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I was going to the <span class="BUILDING">Wurzberger school</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span>, at one time, in the last year, 1938, beginning of 1938, they wanted a foreign language to be taught and the question was, do you want Spanish or French.</sentence><sentence id="1906">The majority wanted Spanish.</sentence><sentence id="1907">After the majority wanted Spanish, they asked, is there anyone who can teach Spanish.</sentence><sentence id="1908">I had had correspondence with <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, a friend of mine, so I knew a little bit of Spanish, so I said, I'll try to give a Spanish course.</sentence><sentence id="1909">So I was appointed the first Spanish teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1910">And in order to make it applicable and have people join this course, I gave a sample lecture in a big <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> and she was one of the students there.</sentence><sentence id="1911">She didn't even know that.</sentence><sentence id="1912">And then we met again when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1922">Q: Well the reason I ask is that it seems a lot of survivors marry survivors, a lot of survivors from one <span class="REGION">area</span> in Europe, later marry somebody from that same area of Europe and I'm wondering if there's a logical reason for that and why you wouldn't have necessarily married somebody who was American, or?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1924">A: No, there, and a few reasons for it, number one, first of all, people like to marry someone who, with whom they can converse, I mean, who is on their level and maybe even intellectually, culturally and so forth and when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, my wife had an aunt there who knew this</sentence><sentence id="1926">7 family, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1927">In fact I knew some, I knew of a cousin of my wife's, whom I liked, but she was killed in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1928">And then one day when my wife came here, she made the contact and, so that's, we had met before as I said, but not knowing it and that's how it came about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1934">Q: So it wasn't a matter of either more comfort there or less comfort with somebody who doesn't understand where you came from and what you went through.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1936">A: No, it came, it came automatically, you know, it happened this way, just to happen you see, it is true, you see, that both people try to marry someone who is from their own background or so, unless someone cannot find anyone at all here and I know people who are going to <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span>, or go to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> and marry there, but usually they try to find someone.</sentence><sentence id="1937">Also I liked her family and the family gave me some, something, yeah, helped.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1940">Q: Well I guess, you know when you had talked about initially coming over here and being surprised that most Americans were clueless about what was happening in Europe and they didn't care and they didn't even want to know, it would seem to me that it might be logical that you'd want to spend your time with people who had your same sensibilities about this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1942">A: Mmm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1944">Q: You know, that's the thing ___--_--waas trying to get at.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1946">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1948">Q: I guess I have one more question.</sentence><sentence id="1949">Do you think there's any way that the Holocaust could have been avoided?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1952">A: Not the way in which the German government operated at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1953">Because in the 20's, when they wanted to establish a democracy in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, _ a democracy, most people were not in favor of this democracy, or they didn't care and therefore, one government after the other fell.</sentence><sentence id="1954">That was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="1955">Number two was, the Treaty of Versailles, in 1918, 1919, did not intend to create a</sentence><sentence id="1957">8 <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, or what we have now, in the <span class="BUILDING">League of Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1958">They did not want to, they did not want to bring people closer, but they wanted to separate people and they made different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, small <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, which didn't exist before.</sentence><sentence id="1959">They made this a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, this a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, they made all different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, before it was all united.</sentence><sentence id="1960">And all this encouraged someone like Hitler to bring them together again and to tell the people, you see, don't worry about it, you are not treated well, the Versailles Treaty didn't treat you well and there's inflation and you can't get anything, no jobs, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1961">I will bring the sun.</sentence><sentence id="1962">But he could only do this by having a scapegoat and he took the Jews, because the Jews are very, very passive in this way.</sentence><sentence id="1963">So therefore, from this point of view, giving him the power, people gave him the power, so that Holocaust came about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1976">Q: And the passivity of the Jews, did it play into this?</sentence><sentence id="1977">Should they have resisted more strongly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1980">A: No, the Jews don't resist, you see, the Jews try to go along with the government, whatever the government is.</sentence><sentence id="1981">In fact, even here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, after Truman I think, they mention the name of the president in every prayer.</sentence><sentence id="1982">Roosevelt especially, Truman.</sentence><sentence id="1983">After Truman, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1984">They did not want to, they accepted whatever, whatever the government said.</sentence><sentence id="1985">Pray for the welfare of the government, so they accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="1986">What should they have done?</sentence><sentence id="1987">What should they have done?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1996">Q: Is there something wrong in our teaching?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1998">A: It has to be honest.</sentence><sentence id="1999">The first thing that happened, what Hitler did, it was in education.</sentence><sentence id="2000">He changed the, all the pictures in the books of the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and who knows what and put in the Jews with the big nose and with hook and this kind of thing and such a person you have to hate.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2001">You can put everything into a child's mind, a child doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2002">They learned this only much later.</sentence><sentence id="2003">So therefore, if a child does not get the right information from the beginning, everything goes wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2004">And that's why this sof the ------__ and other things, taught them wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2005">Education is very important.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2009">Q: But what about our education as Jews?</sentence><sentence id="2010">To make us stand up a little bit quicker?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2011">A: What should they do?</sentence><sentence id="2012">The Jews education does not, does not emphasize war or things of this sort, or hate or, even the Christian religion you see, says love your neighbor like yourself.</sentence><sentence id="2013">And many religions teach, say this, but the difference is, we say and I don't know if I should say it, but we say, that's a way to act, not that's a way to think only.</sentence><sentence id="2014">Roosevelt said it.</sentence><sentence id="2015">Roosevelt knew only in mind, but not in action.</sentence><sentence id="2016">Same thing also with religion you see, to love your neighbor like yourself in your mind, yes, but in your action, not.</sentence><sentence id="2017">The action has to follow what you say in your mind, if not so, not so.</sentence><sentence id="2018">So that's what they have to teach the children here, to really act, to be together, to be friends with each other and so forth, to have more kind of realistic system, not just in your mind.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2027">Q: Well, getting back to your saying that Jews as a people are passive...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2029">A: It seems so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2031">Q: They're supportive of their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> or their government, that they're passive.</sentence><sentence id="2032">Should we be less passive, should we be more attentive to what's going on and act?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2035">A: There are certain, in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> in which you should not be passive, but that I cannot say and make everyone responsible for, that is, there are certain laws, let's say the 10 Commandments, you see, they should be more active in those, not to kill, not to steal and so forth, you see, and just be more active in that, not only the Jews, everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2036">Because what's going on now with the drug scene, with the killing and so forth, they don't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="2037">So, so there are certain, certain laws which, which every person should understand, logically.</sentence><sentence id="2038">And that they should teach them and not only teach them to think about this, I want to, I don't want to preach here, you see, you see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2043">Q: I don't have any other questions, is there something you would like to add, that I haven't asked you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2048">A: Except, I don't know if I gave you everything, because it's impossible, there are too many things to be remembered and too many things which happened, but, if you want to build a world of peace, that all people want to do now, at least they say so, then, then we have to, then we have to give everyone the equal opportunity, but it's unfortunate that many times, as soon as someone gets a little bit higher, he wants the whole, he wants everything you see, people aren't satisfied with a finger, they want the whole hand.</sentence><sentence id="2049">And, we wrote once, an essay, we _ wrote an essay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> and the essay was called, German loyalty.</sentence><sentence id="2050">The Germans were always loyal to their leader, not only were they loyal to their leader, also they wanted to be on top of everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2051">And they believed in the Darwin theory, the survival of the fittest, we have to be the fittest, the Germans said.</sentence><sentence id="2052">Now if everyone thinks I'm the fittest and he will always subdue other ones and have weaker ones whom he destroys and that's what I want to end with.</sentence><sentence id="2053">The teacher once, once asked me, he brought it out in a class and he said, "The Germans are superior and all the other races are inferior, because we are the strongest, we are the tallest, we are the blondest, we have the bluest eyes," and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2054">And, and he said to me, this was a Nazi teacher, "What do you think about it?"</sentence><sentence id="2055">I said to him, "There is nothing in this world superior or inferior, everyone can rise to a high level, everyone can go low.</sentence><sentence id="2056">But there is one thing in this world which the Nazis don't recognize and that's that every person's different and you don't realize the difference between one person, everyone contributes something you see and you cannot put him down because he's different and him down because he's different in this way and he's different in that way."</sentence><sentence id="2057">Same thing like happens in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="2058">Everyone's different, they can all contribute and as long as they contrib, as long as someone thinks I am superior and you are inferior, I am a majority and you are a minority.</sentence><sentence id="2059">Once a person in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> told me, "The Jews are not a minority," he said to me. "</sentence><sentence id="2060">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, "I said, but maybe another thing.</sentence><sentence id="2061">So I asked him, "When does a minority stop to be a minority?</sentence><sentence id="2064">1 asked him.</sentence><sentence id="2065">He couldn't answer that.</sentence><sentence id="2066">But someone's, if someone works under the logical thinking that he's a minority, then he will always strive to be a majority, we always strive to majority and there will always be a fight going on, but the only time someone thinks I'm different, I have certain things which you don't have and you have certain things which I don't have, then they will live together in peace.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2086">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2088">A: Accept it or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2090">Q: Thank you very much.</sentence><sentence id="2091">You mentioned a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span> and I'm wondering at what point you were in a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2094">A: I think I made a mistake, it should not be called <span class="BUILDING">Nazi school</span>, but <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2095">Because when Hitler came to power, all the previous directors and teachers were either asked to become members of the Nazi party, or leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2096">So the director in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, where I went, the , had been with the Social Democrat party and he was dismissed.</sentence><sentence id="2097">And from then on, there were two kinds of teachers, the teachers who were members of the party from long time ago, the early numbers, all the early numbers had priority or a later number.</sentence><sentence id="2098">But they came all in with the Nazi emblem, which was like a lifesaver and there was written NASDP, National Socialist Democratic Workers Party, that's how they called themselves, with a swastika in the middle and one teacher came in with a Nazi uniform and whenever a teacher came in, the students get up and says Heil Hitler, when the teacher leaves the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>, Heil Hitler, they all stand up.</sentence><sentence id="2099">But that was, that was already before that they would stand up, but that was respect for the teacher, because you were, you were supposed to have respect for the teacher, the teacher was a high official in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2106">Q: So this was in 1933 and did you, what, did you stand up, did you have to stand up to salute.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2111">A: I stand up, but I did not have to lift the hand with the Heil Hitler salute or the Nazi salute, but there was, when you came into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, there was a teacher standing and everyone when he came in, would lift his hand.</sentence><sentence id="2112">I didn't have to lift my hand, but then on the other hand, some people who didn't know it, would beat you up if you didn't do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2115">Q: Were you ever beaten up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2117">A: No, not for that.</sentence><sentence id="2118">But I tell you, I saw a boy on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, he met a Nazi and he lifted his hand and he fell from his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, so they said on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, you don't have to lift your hand, just make, sit up straight.</sentence><sentence id="2119">But this teacher came in and one of these teachers who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.580032" long="7.749989">Strasbourg</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace- Lorraine</span>, which was French and German again, he called me over, his son was in my own, in my class, in my class, same class as 1am.</sentence><sentence id="2120">He said to me privately, "You know, I am not actually anti- Semitic," he said, "but in order to keep my job, I have to put this life saver on," he said to me.</sentence><sentence id="2121">And, and this other teacher I told you about, he gave a course in Assencunder(ph), it means knowledge of the races.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2127">Q: And you went, you took this course?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2129">A: [had to take it.</sentence><sentence id="2130">The only thing is, afterwards they changed, that I didn't go on Shabbat any more to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, so this teacher was an older teacher, he was 65 at that time, he called me over and he said to me, "If you don't come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday, I'm going to teach Hitler's Kampf, Mein Kampf, the book on Saturday, so you do, are not there.</sentence><sentence id="2131">And if you miss anything, I will give you the, I will tell some student to give you the homework," see there, but still, some teachers of, from the older class, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2132">But they had to be members, you see and if you had and if not, they could be dismissed.</sentence><sentence id="2133">Now him they probably left, he was going anyhow, retirement age 65 there, he left.</sentence><sentence id="2134">That's okay, but, but I help as a teacher, you see, when he gave this kind, so I asked a question, what makes it~. :~"Why does he know everything?</sentence><sentence id="2135">So they taught that he has intuition that comes</sentence><sentence id="2137">3 from himself Hitler does not believe in manifestation from <span class="NPIP">above</span>, because there's no one above him.</sentence><sentence id="2138">No God, no nothing, he didn't believe in God, even though he was Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="2139">So there's no manifestation from <span class="NPIP">above</span>, everything comes from the blood and soil and it goes up to him and he knows it by intuition.</sentence><sentence id="2140">What they call a, I forget already the word in German, but it's something like a combination of blood and soil.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2155">A: They taught me similar things and they also taught me that the German race is superior.</sentence><sentence id="2156">Why?Because when God created the world in he interprets the bible, but not the correct way of course, he created man and then they believe in Darwin's theory, that the fittest survive, only the survival of the fittest, so that means the fittest survive and we are the fittest.</sentence><sentence id="2157">The Jews are not fit, that's why they have to be eradicated.</sentence><sentence id="2158">And about this, what I mentioned before about inferiority and superiority and which I don't believe in, I believe in the same thing, you see, but difference, differency, differentiation, but I don't believe in superior and this other thing.</sentence><sentence id="2159">And finally, oh, not about that.</sentence><sentence id="2160">I was the only student of 700 in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, that was a big <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
