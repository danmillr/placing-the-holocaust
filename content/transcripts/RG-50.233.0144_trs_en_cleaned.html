individually, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1279">She never talked about that particular incident.</sentence><sentence id="1280">It was a very painful incident in her life.</sentence><sentence id="1281">Very painful.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And even though she used to talk about a lot of things, she used to remind us when we were in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, at one point, and she had to go to work and when she came back my sister and I were gone and my father was gone.</sentence><sentence id="1283">It seems like the Germans came, they were coming and they said we're going to put the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on fire whoever's there doesn't run away or doesn't give themselves up they're going to get burned alive.</sentence><sentence id="1284">So I don't know how it happened, how my sister and I somehow or other my father, where was my father, I'm trying to think, he was also gone in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1285">He did not go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, but my mother went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> and he went someplace and my sister and I were left alone.</sentence><sentence id="1286">And when the Germans came, we looked at each other, what are we going to do, we got to run away someplace.</sentence><sentence id="1287">So, we went downstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> we found there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> there to go to the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, so we escaped through a few other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1288">They were also empty, so we didn't know what had happened to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we were originally.</sentence><sentence id="1289">I don't know if they put it on fire or they didn't put it.</sentence><sentence id="1290">But the two of us crawled through and we wound up another 21</sentence><sentence id="1292"><span class="BUILDING">building</span> and the first thing we started doing is running from <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was all abandoned and there was no food nowhere.</sentence><sentence id="1293">We turned quietly every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and every <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, we looked all over and then we hear Germans marching downstairs and they're entering the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and here's my sister and I alone in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it's all empty.</sentence><sentence id="1294">I remember I took her and I put her inside a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen cabinet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1295">I pushed her inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen cabinet</span> and I put a blanket on top of her and I closed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> and I hid behind a chest that stood like on a corner, it was some kind of corner chest.</sentence><sentence id="1296">I squished in the back of that chest and covered myself also with a blanket so if they even look in they" ll think there are rags there.</sentence><sentence id="1297">And I took a blanket and covered myself and the two of us stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="1298">We heard the German footsteps and we heard them getting closer and closer and then they kicked open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they marched in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1299">They must have been looking for Jews from <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1300">This was their preoccupation and that's how I know this, and they walked in and they machine gunned with the machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="1301">They were shooting in every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1302">All they did was go around with machine gun and shooting.</sentence><sentence id="1303">I guess in a way they were afraid also maybe somebody was going to attack them or something.</sentence><sentence id="1304">So they would come in with the machine guns, shoot, walk in, I heard them talking loud and clear I didn't understand what they were saying.</sentence><sentence id="1305">Then I heard them walk out.</sentence><sentence id="1306">And when they walked out and they left the <span class="DLF">door</span>, my first words were, Chaja, Chaja, my sister's name, are you alive?</sentence><sentence id="1307">She says Yes, are you alive?</sentence><sentence id="1308">I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="1309">So we got together again, she came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> and we decided we're going to hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1310">From now on it was no good in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because they are shooting and they may shoot us.</sentence><sentence id="1311">So we'll go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1312">We go all the way up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and there's a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and we hear voices.</sentence><sentence id="1313">So we realize, because we were very quiet, we knew there were people hidden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1314">We started moving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> away and the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> didn't know what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="1315">And I said, we were yelling in Polish, let us in, let us in, we got to hide with you.</sentence><sentence id="1316">So my sister said, well, I'm going to cry so loud that the Germans are going to hear us and I'm going to tell them that you're hiding there, so let us in there.</sentence><sentence id="1317">We came in over there, we sat with them, they had water, so we drank a little water with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
