<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: But I also remember, now that you've jogged my memory, that I went to <span class="BUILDING">pre- school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, first grade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>, and we had to draw red stars and -- and you know, Stalin's picture and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="167">So that obviously was during the Russian occupation, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and it was one of those things typical of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">This was not in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was in the -- what's called the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which is probably 200 years old anyway.</sentence><sentence id="198">And it has a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and it looked like an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and you walk in through a little <span class="DLF">gate</span>, and there's a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">And so, our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, we walked through the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, up some <span class="DLF">stairs</span>, and -- but our <span class="DLF">windows</span> were out to the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: <span class="DLF">Tilto Street</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Uh-huh, so that's a small <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: Yeah, it's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: And it had a lot of great little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, most of which are gone now, but they were still there when we were there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: You -- you say that you remember seeing the German soldiers marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Well, I don't think it was marching, I guess there were just -- there was a parade, I guess, aft-after they do -- marched in.</sentence><sentence id="221">But I don't remember them marching in.</sentence><sentence id="222">I do remember when the war began, I was walking down <span class="BUILDING">Tilto Gatve</span>, and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from somewhere with my mother, and we heard like a muffled explosion somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I guess that was a German bomb being dropped somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="224">But there weren't too many of them, they didn't, you know, mash up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> too well.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="225">But then the Polish woman, remember running by yelling, paniczka(ph), paniczka(ph), wojna, which, you know --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: And what does that mean?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: That means, paniczka(ph) means like lady, lady, it-it's war, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: And so that -- that's what it sounded, but I don't remember -- there were no acts of war in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="232">The Germans just, you know, moved in and that the extent of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Do you have any memories of how the atmosphere in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> changed?</sentence><sentence id="236">Did your parents look nervous, did they seem --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, I mean, everybody was nervous throughout this whole period.</sentence><sentence id="238">And I do remember that there was a lot of social activity, that they would go together, you know, and have parties, and you know, talk and why my -- my father never used to</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="245">smoke, well then he started smoking with his friends, because they were -- they were always nervous and not certain of what -- what was going to happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: And his job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> had been -- can you tell us a little bit about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Well, he was -- like I said that -- at -- at -- at first he was ins-inspector of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, where he would go inspect and file reports on various <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that he was -- somebody who I guess oversaw the hiring and promotion of teachers.</sentence><sentence id="250">And then at a va -- at the la -- last position he had, he was a director or deputy director for special and vocational education.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: I guess the reason why I come back to this is that during the first Soviet occupation, teachers were particularly targeted for deportation by the Soviets.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: And so I'm surprised that they weren't on this -- that they weren't targeted in this way, that he continued having some sort of job in the educational sphere.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Yeah, I -- and in fact, he -- he took advantage of -- of, I guess the Soviet occupation to move into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> because before that it was Polish, and there was no such possibility.</sentence><sentence id="260">But I guess a lot of opportunities for people to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> became available just before or during the Soviet occupa -- first Soviet occupation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Oh, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Yeah.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Well, I realize that the period of time that we're talking about with you, really will start from 1941 til 1944.</sentence><sentence id="271">And at that time you were between six and 10 years old?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Right, right.</sentence><sentence id="273">Well, nine to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="275">Nine, 10 years old.</sentence><sentence id="276">So how -- do you remember ho-how life changed?</sentence><sentence id="277">I mean, you saw -- you had an image of -- of German soldiers marching in a parade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you have an image and a memory of a Polish lady ran -- running and -- and saying --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Yeah, the war is --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: -- the war is here.</sentence><sentence id="280">What were some of the other images, some of the other fragments of memories that you have from the very first days?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Well, the first -- it's hard to say because na -- we lived in this little <span class="DLF">street</span>, away from -- only about a block away from a main <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: But as far as a --a four or five year old, six year old child is concerned, it might be la -- two miles away, because you'd never get out there anyway.</sentence><sentence id="286">So, I didn't see very much of -- I do remember, before the Germans came of -- I was walking again with the -- well, we -- either my mother or my ma -- her mother, my grandmother would take me for walks, you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>, and before the Russians left, I saw</sentence><sentence id="288">Interview with Arvydas Kliore 8 February 18, 2013 some -- right around <span class="DLF">Cathedral Square</span>, there -- there -- there were a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> passed with -- loaded with people and with Russian soldiers with bayonets standing in the corners of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="289">And I later found out those were the people who were being deported to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, being taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Did you ever walk -- remember walking around in the real old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which would have been the Jewish quarter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: Yes, we -- we do that all the time.</sentence><sentence id="299">My grandmother would take me to the old <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, she was a devout Catholic and she would go -- I remember there was -- I think it was the <span class="BUILDING">Dominican church</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">stairway</span> that the supplicants walked up underneath.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: And they had little relics of saints" blood or something like that and that they kissed it and so on.</sentence><sentence id="305">And I remembered that -- her doing that, and in fact I-- I was able to see that at one of our visits, you know, I-lately, about, you know, five, six years ago.</sentence><sentence id="306">They're rebuilding the whole thing and I actually got to see the same <span class="DLF">staircase</span>, only now it looked a lot smaller than it did before.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: Did your mother -- did you have conversations -- now this takes place in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when you're already older and so on.</sentence><sentence id="458">Did you have more extensive conversations with her about these things, about these topics?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="461">A: Well she -- she didn't like to talk about that very much, but of course she was very much aware of what was going on there and -- but I don't know if she really</sentence><sentence id="463">knew exactly what was going on there because this was not something like a public record, but of course everybody knew what was happening to the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="468">Q: But I mean later, after the war, when you said that when you were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, she mentions this -- this incident, that these are the soldiers and they were in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="469">At that time, was there more conversation?</sentence><sentence id="470">You were already in the west, you were already -- you know, it was safe and -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="471">Was there more conversation about such things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: Well she -- she was always very -- a humane person.</sentence><sentence id="477">And it's obvious that it was difficult for her to talk about something as -- as hag -- ghastly as that, you know, where -- where you know, mass killing was -- was carried out.</sentence><sentence id="478">And she -- she was, of course were very condemning of the -- of the g-guys who were -- the drunks who were shooting there, you know.</sentence><sentence id="479">But other than that, oh there was -- a-and -- course th-the -- the whole drift was that we don't have anything to do with them, these are just extremely, you know, bad people, they were the -- should stay away from them, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="496">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="497">What were the rest of the war years like?</sentence><sentence id="498">Was there any other interaction with Germans that you remember?</sentence><sentence id="499">Did you ever pass the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by whe -- after it was established?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="504">A: I don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="505">We might have, but I don't think anybody wanted to go near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because it was full of German guards, and things were closed off with <span class="DLF">gates</span>, and people just didn't want to get in -- near that whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="506">I do remember that I think it must have been about 1943 or so, when the Germans, I guess in response to the failure of the Lithuanian -- Lithuanians to establish a--a SS regiment or something like that, began sending, you know, selected people to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="507">People who had nationalistic, you know, inclinations and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="508">And a number of people from the ministry where my father worked were shipped off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>, and you know, some of them died there.</sentence><sentence id="509">And so I remember that for -- for weeks, my father and -- and his other colleagues, you know, switched locations where they slept every night, so that they could not be easily found if -- if-- cause usually when they come to arrest you they come -- they don't go to your <span class="BUILDING">place of work</span>, they -- they come to -- when you're sleeping in your -- in</sentence><sentence id="511">your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="512">So they -- they were -- well, you know, scared of getting shipped off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span> and so they -- they did this.</sentence><sentence id="513">And so that was, I think it was in this se-several, in the last months of -- of the German occupation with.</sentence><sentence id="514">Cause this was going on already and they were trying to avoid that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="527">Q: Are there -- are there any other memories, fragments of memories from that time, about the war, about the occupation, about perhaps conversations that were had about these things, that -- that you can recall, when you were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: Well, I don't think that our parents, and of course nobody else talked to children about what they knew what was -- that was going on.</sentence><sentence id="530">Now of course, they all knew what was going on, but they were not sharing this with us.</sentence><sentence id="531">Of course, I think that my mother was always, you know, aghast that this was going on, you know.</sentence><sentence id="532">And my father, you know, our -- this was a time when there were epidemics now going through.</sentence><sentence id="533">There was a typh -- typhus epidemic which my sister and I spent a few weeks, you know, trying to -- to get to-- Deet.</sentence><sentence id="534">And I remember that, you know, before -- before the, I guess <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and -- and the destruction of the Jews, our family doctors were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="535">Dr. Gehrler(ph) and doctor -- I du -- don't remember the name.</sentence><sentence id="536">And I think that -- and then toward the end, I guess, they weren't -- they weren't there any more, so that was, you know.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="541">Q: Did you have any memories of who th -- of these individuals?</sentence><sentence id="542">Do you remember th -- how they looked?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="543">A: I faintly remember how Dr. Gehrler(ph) looked, because he would come and take care of us.</sentence><sentence id="544">But I don't -- don't know anything else about him or what happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="545">He obviously wound up at some -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paneriai</span> or whatever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="549">Q: Oh.</sentence><sentence id="550">When did your own interest in -- in these events that people were so silent about, when did it start to appear?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: It was, I think, always there, because I knew, of course by reading the inter -- the na -- the international press and -- and some books about the Holocaust, and -- and the -- the -- the destruction of the Jewish population of <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">And of course you would -- could not see very much of this, or any of this in the Lithuanian press here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, because that was like a taboo topic, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="557">Q: Why?</sentence><sentence id="558">Why do you think it was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Well, I think many reasons.</sentence><sentence id="562">I think one reason was that the Lithuanians who controlled the press were themselves ashamed of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="563">They did not want to mention it or to -- to -- to -- to even, you know, mention it in the -- in their papers.</sentence><sentence id="564">Maybe it would go away, you know, that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="565">Now of course, there were some who were openly anti-Semitic, who said that this was all, you</sentence><sentence id="567">Interview with Arvydas Kliore 8 February 18, 2013 know, some nonsense that the Jews are -- are spreading, you know.</sentence><sentence id="568">But that -- that, I think, was the minority, most of them just didn't want to, you know, hear about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="578">Q: But why would they have a feeling of shame?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="580">A: Because they knew that there was some -- obviously they knew that there was some involvement by -- by Lithuanian people, not just the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: Because when you look at -- at -- I-I started researching this thing on my own a long time ago.</sentence><sentence id="585">As soon as I got my degree and started working and se -- then started reading books.</sentence><sentence id="586">And when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> came out, I w -- I went to the web pages of the various organizations that deal with the history of the Holocaust, and you know, find out what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="587">And after -- and -- <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> became independent again in 91, there was -- there were publications by the -- the history, a kind of, I guess history department or history institute, of various maps have to do with the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="588">And one of them was a map of where the executions of Jews took place in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="589">And I was amazed to see that the whole map of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was covered with these <span class="NPIP">places</span>, which also mentioned a number that were executed in each <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="596">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="609">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="611">A: So that suggested to me that were a lot more people from the police forces of that -- of the provincial police forces, who were involved.</sentence><sentence id="612">And obviously this is the case, an-and I've been trying to find out who they were.</sentence><sentence id="613">And in fact, I'm reading a book now by -- just came out recently, I forgot the name, where a woman PhD, Sutton, I think was it --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="615">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sutton</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="616">And when she shows a picture of the SS officers with the police chiefs of the <span class="REGION">Lithuanian provinces</span> sitting, a nice picture.</sentence><sentence id="617">And of course I--I--I---it doesn't take much -- I don't have to be Einstein to figure out what they were talking about there, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="621">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="622">Why is this important to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="628">Interview with Arvydas Kliore 8 February 18, 2013</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="629">A: Because I am Lithuanian, I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="630">What happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> is important to me.</sentence><sentence id="631">And I want to know the truth.</sentence><sentence id="632">I mean, it's -- it's -- it's kind of hard to take to -- to talk about the people who -- who are, you know, accomplices in something of this sort.</sentence><sentence id="633">But if that happened, I want to know about it.</sentence><sentence id="634">I want to know who these people were.</sentence><sentence id="635">Where th -- where the -- are th-they now.</sentence><sentence id="636">Most of them are dead, but, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="647">A: Not too many.</sentence><sentence id="648">I think a lot of them take the attitude that oh, this happened, you know, 60 years ago, forget about it, you know, it's gone, let's just go on with life.</sentence><sentence id="649">They don't care what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="655">A: Well, any human being should be concerned about a -- a-- some -- something that happened in which millions of innocent people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="656">And so I don't think anybody can just shake their head and -- and forget about it.</sentence><sentence id="657">Unfortunately, th-things like that haven't stopped happening since then, your -- you look at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Srebrenica</span>, and look at <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that.</sentence><sentence id="658">I mean, genocide, that goes on even now.</sentence><sentence id="659">And</sentence><sentence id="661">Interview with Arvydas Kliore *deg February 18, 2013 I think people have to be aware of this an-and try to stop it, be at -- learn from mistakes that were made, or -- or they weren't mistakes, it's just a misplacement of -- of priorities --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="663">A: -- where the National Socialist Order simplistic solutions to -- to complicated problems.</sentence><sentence id="664">Okay, you don't like the Jews, the Jews you think are doing something against your, you know, countrymen.</sentence><sentence id="665">So, of course, you kill them all, that's the best way to get to redress the problem.</sentence><sentence id="666">And this is exactly what they were doing in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and -- and in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> and places like that, and that should be something that people would no longer think about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
