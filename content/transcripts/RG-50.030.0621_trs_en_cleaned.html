<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Good morning.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: Good morning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fanny Aizenberg on April 21", 2011.</sentence><sentence id="5">And Fanny, first of all, I-- like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our -- your time today to speak with us.</sentence><sentence id="6">But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask -- and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on.</sentence><sentence id="7">All of these things are very important.</sentence><sentence id="8">But I'd like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the -- the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac -- you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had.</sentence><sentence id="9">So I'd like to talk about that a little bit, about what is it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today.</sentence><sentence id="10">If you could share some of those thoughts with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: For me it's very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons.</sentence><sentence id="19">I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, but all those people have been single people when the war started.</sentence><sentence id="20">I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities.</sentence><sentence id="23">And we -- it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I'm still living with the horrors I lived through in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: So, in other words, every time you talk, there's a cost, there's a cost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Absu-absolutely right.</sentence><sentence id="34">Of course it is.</sentence><sentence id="35">Even today, which is so many years later, when I'm in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and I pass where there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, I still break out in a sweat, which is not the polit -- polite way of saying.</sentence><sentence id="36">Because we had been for so long in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> and I don't think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer -- to describe such unhuman things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Do you think --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: And we didn't know what was waiting for us at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="45">Q: Were there -- were there many years when you didn't speak about your life at all in -- about this -- these aspects of your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Well, I've only start -- what is it, Steven, 10 years?S: Ten years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Fanny is talking to Steven Vitto who is [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Yes, when he was always -- and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with Steven, because of his kindness, of his generosity and caring.</sentence><sentence id="52">Don't forget, Steven, not because he's a young person, we are from such a different background and we</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="59">used to have conversations, like one human being should be fortunate to have with another one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Tell me of -- tell me a little bit about this, this is -- you started as a volunteer here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, is this what you're talking about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="63">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: And how is it -- and what was Steve's job?</sentence><sentence id="66">What was his way of meeting you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="69">What was -- how did your interactions start?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: Well, it really started that I saw in "The Jewish Week," which is a small magazine --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: -- advertised that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> needs volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="73">And one way or another, I was debating for a long, long time, and there's a lot of things which I didn't care for to come here.</sentence><sentence id="74">And I have decided I want to come and see what it is.</sentence><sentence id="75">And I am -- was interview by somebody, which we connected very nicely.</sentence><sentence id="76">Her name is Jill and I don't -- Coynburg(ph) or Cohenberg(ph), I don't remember her name.</sentence><sentence id="77">And somehow, we had a conversation that we understand each other.</sentence><sentence id="78">She said, look Fanny, you could start here right now, or you could wait for about two months when we have a orientation.</sentence><sentence id="79">And I knew that if I would wait for an orientation, I would never come back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="88">Q: You knew yourself well then --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: So she say you could do -- yes, I could change my mind.</sentence><sentence id="96">I had many reasons for not wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do come.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: What were some of the reasons for not wanting to come?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: There's a lot of things I didn't agree the way the things were working here.</sentence><sentence id="102">So I had the choice and I did not wait to be oriented.</sentence><sentence id="103">I felt I had been oriented a lot, through the time I was -- the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that was enough orientation.</sentence><sentence id="104">Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and immediately we connected very nicely.</sentence><sentence id="105">At the same time, I was translating a book from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, who just came out.</sentence><sentence id="106">This was a no -- official book, how many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, how many people made into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">What many people didn't know, that many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> had gas and people were gassed in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> before they even got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: So as you were coming to -- to work at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> as a volunteer, you were also translating this book at the same time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Yes, bes --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: I'd like to stop -- excuse me inter -- for interrupting you Fanny, I'd like to bring Steve into this shot a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="119">Can we do that?</sentence><sentence id="120">Is there a way for Steve to stand right here?Q2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: This looks like -- this is two people in one shot?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="129">Q2: This is a two shot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: That's a two shot -- Q2: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: -- yes, at this -- while Steve is in the frame, then yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="137">Q2: Keep it on the two shot?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="141">Q2: Okay, that sounds good.</sentence><sentence id="142">All-righty-roo.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: We're ready?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="147">Q2: We're all set now, uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="150">I'd like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I'd like Steve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of you met and interacted.</sentence><sentence id="151">So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is that your -- your <span class="DLF">path</span> with Fanny's crossed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="155">S: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry.</sentence><sentence id="156">We've since expanded, now we're called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims Resource Center.</sentence><sentence id="157">And my job then and my job now is to ensure that the individual experiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and then made available to people who are asking about them.</sentence><sentence id="158">So I bridge the <span class="DLF">gap</span> between researching <span class="BUILDING">archives</span>, but always interacting with the public in s -- to find</sentence><sentence id="160">out what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual's experience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we're doing an interview with Fanny right now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="170">S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which is survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience.</sentence><sentence id="171">So, to fill in that <span class="DLF">gap</span>, we want people to come to us and provide that information that's otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, or calling us or writing me for that information.</sentence><sentence id="172">That's one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="178">S: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and they're very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to arrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us in a variety of ways.</sentence><sentence id="179">And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from -- she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several -- working with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span>, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry.</sentence><sentence id="180">And we often get</sentence><sentence id="182">requests not only for individual information, but information based on <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">So for instance, all the people who were from -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> for instance, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, or from a particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, or share a ca -- particular experience, and with our database, we're able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I had a particular request for people who were -- somebody wanted information from those who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, who were registered with us.</sentence><sentence id="185">And Fanny was able to help me to --I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual.</sentence><sentence id="186">That was one database.</sentence><sentence id="187">The other infor -- information -- the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that's a list of the deportations that took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">And this particular collection is based on date, date of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> only.</sentence><sentence id="189">And also, it was producing.</sentence><sentence id="190">It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="206">I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we have French and Flemish, as -- as languages, so -- S: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: So which language was it, of those two?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="209">S: This is in French, okay, you're right, you're right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: It was in French, okay, sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="215">S: But because of Fanny's background in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, I thought it would be a good fit, and this -- this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that.</sentence><sentence id="216">And before each -- it's divided by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span>, before each name list of those on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> is a description of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span>, and -- in French.</sentence><sentence id="217">And Fanny was able to translate those introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those who were on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, but they could also read, in English now, that general description of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: But cle -- thank you, Steve, because I -- I --I think we needed to get a sense of what was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more happened.</sentence><sentence id="225">This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you.</sentence><sentence id="226">And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f -- that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story.</sentence><sentence id="231">And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening.</sentence><sentence id="232">Also, when we got the book from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, further descriptions, the number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, the number of people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and how many transport, at the same time the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> got a book called "The Hidden Heroes."</sentence><sentence id="233">That book was written by a German reporter.</sentence><sentence id="234">She is from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">She tried to interview peop -- Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and nobody wanted to give her any information.</sentence><sentence id="236">Somehow, she was so determined, she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the</sentence><sentence id="238">underground.</sentence><sentence id="239">The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that.</sentence><sentence id="240">So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together.</sentence><sentence id="241">And that book wasn't selling too well, and they had -- she had to change the title, to "The 20" Transport."</sentence><sentence id="242">And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group.</sentence><sentence id="243">Where in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">And this is why in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can't even find the names, who organized in convents, in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, including my own child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: That's amazing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to help [indecipherable].</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: So wou --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: And many of the words from the documents from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, I did not know because I didn't learn English of those documents.</sentence><sentence id="268">So Steven would -- made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted</sentence><sentence id="270">to know.</sentence><sentence id="271">Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the second <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students.</sentence><sentence id="272">So we really -- my job really was, can we help you?</sentence><sentence id="273">And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, with the picture from the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted.</sentence><sentence id="274">And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you?Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer.</sentence><sentence id="275">And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was representing.</sentence><sentence id="276">So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the computer, to get the -- all the information, which he typed for him to take.</sentence><sentence id="277">So he didn't have to go to so many <span class="NPIP">places</span>, because he was originally in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">So you see, you never know the contact you have with Steven in that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span>, because he knows the answers to everything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Well, it -- to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my mind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it had to do with the Belgian underground.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: Youre right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and through your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: Exactly, you're right.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="304">Q: And is -- and is that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our stories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: That must have been --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable -- there's another word which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so unbelievable, which I haven't done to such extent.</sentence><sentence id="309">Because this was always bottle up and still is, to many extent. [</sentence><sentence id="310">indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the same thing, thanks to Steven.</sentence><sentence id="311">He made sure that I would be speaking up.</sentence><sentence id="312">He said, if you don't do it now, when you gonna do it?</sentence><sentence id="313">And I know I'm old, so I had to do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="320">But it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives, have been able to have such a wonderful relationship.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Steve?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things and I'm very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="325">So that's why I say --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: Steve, we're putting you on the spot all right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="327">A: No, I'm not.</sentence><sentence id="328">He knows I'm not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: So ever -- so I --if I ever get a gold star, it belongs to Steven.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they've gone by, what you've learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="341">S: Oh my God.</sentence><sentence id="342">Well, the first thing I wanted to say is I br-- I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I'm very fortunate in my job that I'm able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os -- really special.</sentence><sentence id="343">And again, one of my profe -- jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered.</sentence><sentence id="344">And so, while we had great conversations, I didn't want it to end there.</sentence><sentence id="345">I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story.</sentence><sentence id="346">I always get her -- want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="347">And so in this way, it's sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible.</sentence><sentence id="348">She has so many things to teach about -- I guess mainly for me is overcoming.</sentence><sentence id="349">Someone who's been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through.</sentence><sentence id="350">And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that.</sentence><sentence id="351">You go through so many things and sometimes there's no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass.</sentence><sentence id="352">And you're affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="353">And Fanny was</sentence><sentence id="355">Interview with Fanny Aizenberg (r) April 21, 2011 able to do that.</sentence><sentence id="356">So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter.</sentence><sentence id="357">And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there's a beautiful 12 year old girl that's a friend of my son's actually.</sentence><sentence id="358">And I see that if it wasn't for Fanny just persevering and going on, that's -- if it wasn't for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn't able to later on in her life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="379">Thank you very much.</sentence><sentence id="380">And we're going to continue now with let's say, the usual part of our oral history.</sentence><sentence id="381">But I thought it was very important --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="382">A: I think so.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="383">Q: -- that we -- that we would be able to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: Because -- I'll you why I feel it's so important.</sentence><sentence id="385">It's very difficult in this time and age, with technology that's so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the -- the computers, the cell phone, just name it and it's growing bigger and bigger, that people still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that they have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they're saying.</sentence><sentence id="386">Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt --and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="394">Interview with Fanny Aizenberg 6 April 21, 2011 it, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I'm not like other people, which "m not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: Because you suffered?</sentence><sentence id="397">Because you went through these things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
