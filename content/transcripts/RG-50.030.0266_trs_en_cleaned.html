<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Could you please tell me your name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name's Robert Zimmer.</sentence><sentence id="4">I now live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamsburg</span>, <span class="REGION">Virginia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: Where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, on the 28th of April 1924.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Could you tell us a little bit about what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> was like, your childhood was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, I was part of the working class community.</sentence><sentence id="14">My dad was a machinist on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Erie Railroad</span>, and we lived through the Depression, which was sort of harrowing at times, especially one Christmas Eve when my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said he was laid off, and then that he was out of work about six months, and then he got back to work again; things improved from that point.</sentence><sentence id="15">So I was a Depression child.</sentence><sentence id="16">We didn't know we were poor.</sentence><sentence id="17">We -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, walked, oh, eight-tenths of a mile I guess.</sentence><sentence id="18">I was a <span class="BUILDING">kindergartner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">And then went through <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">Obviously, for my size, I played basketball, but it was a small <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">There were only 44 of us in the graduating class.</sentence><sentence id="22">I married a girl from the <span class="BUILDING">graduating class</span>, back then.</sentence><sentence id="23">I've known her since we were in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> I guess, and -- but we didn't date until going to the <span class="BUILDING">senior prom</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="24">By that time Pearl Harbor had happened, and everybody was going off to war or working in the war industries.</sentence><sentence id="25">I decided I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, although, I'd been the first one in our family to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> even.</sentence><sentence id="26">My two older sisters, they are 10, 14 years older than I am, they left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as sophomores to help support the family.</sentence><sentence id="27">And my folks said that I didn't have to support the family if I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and that was all the help they could give me for going away to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">I went to the state teacher's college at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brockport</span>, New York.</sentence><sentence id="29">I had enlisted in the -- enlisted Reserve Corp in July of "42, and was called to active duty then in April of "43.</sentence><sentence id="30">This enough background of growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: No, that's fine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: In "42, after enlisting, can you tell us briefly what led up to your activity in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Well, as I said, I'd enlisted in the Reserves, and they had permitted me to start <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">Then in April "43 I went on active duty, went through processing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Agra</span>, and then</sentence><sentence id="58">ended up in basic training at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp McQuaide</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Coast Guard Artillery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">I applied for a -- OCS, the <span class="BUILDING">Boston candidate school</span> to get a commission.</sentence><sentence id="60">My battery commander recommended that we take our applications back and apply for an army specialized training program, ASTP, which promised us 18 months of college training, and then officers candidate school training.</sentence><sentence id="61">That sounded awfully good to me, and I said okay, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Stanford University</span> for processing, and then to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Oregon</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eugene</span>, Oregon, to study engineering.</sentence><sentence id="62">This was the most intense academic work I had ever gone through.</sentence><sentence id="63">Tremendous number of courses that we had to take.</sentence><sentence id="64">We had supervised study every evening.</sentence><sentence id="65">We started at 6:00 o'clock in the morning, and had a schedule back then until 10:00 o'clock at night; and then lights were out at 10:30, so we didn't have much free time.</sentence><sentence id="66">Then in April of "43, this program closed down because of the anticipation of the invasion of Europe, and these troops were really in a holding pattern, we now realized, and we went to fill up the vacancies in the 11th Armored Division, and I became a -- well, I went to the 22nd Tank Battalion Company, AV, for medium <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, and I was a bowl gunner, or a BOG, and an assistant driver on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Sherman tank</span>, medium tank.</sentence><sentence id="67">And they gave us, oh, several review of basic training, taught us how to drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> and how to shoot a 75-millimeter gun from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, and while we're doing things, basic survival, but we got the division -- well, the division was getting ready to ship overseas then, in August, and we moved from <span class="REGION">California</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Cooke</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span> to the <span class="REGION">East Coast</span>, and I think that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span>, <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, and went to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> one night, the SS Samaria, and half of the division was on it, about 5,000 men, and they congratulated us, that it was only single loaded.</sentence><sentence id="68">By that they meant that we didn't have to share our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> with anybody.</sentence><sentence id="69">Because in double loaded you have one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> for two people, and we were able to sleep for eight hours and the other guy would sleep for eight hours.</sentence><sentence id="70">But we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> by ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="71">And I shouldn't say <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">It was actually -- they were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hammocks</span> that were strung across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room tables</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back table</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="73">It was a very, very quiet crossing, but we had British food, and the British didn't make any friends among these American troops with the kind of food they gave us and the service we got.</sentence><sentence id="74">We were very unhappy with the Brits on this score.</sentence><sentence id="75">I don't know if any of the other guys told you about it, but we had close to food riots on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">We did see -- we were called to the general <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> several times, and we did see some action of death charges being dropped.</sentence><sentence id="77">It was a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span>, and-- so I presume that they had some alerts that there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">u-boats</span> stalking or trying to attack the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span>, and much to our surprise saw the headlines of the newspaper saying the SS Samaria had been sunk, and we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, and we were glad the news headline wasn't true.</sentence><sentence id="79">Then they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and took us to the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warminister</span> where we drew <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and had to clean up the equipment, because these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> had been stored, a lot of Cosmoline, it's heavy grease on all parts.</sentence><sentence id="80">It's quite a chore cleaning it up and getting them in working condition.</sentence><sentence id="81">Then we had to check out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, drive them enough to road test them and get a few miles on them so we were</sentence><sentence id="83">confident that they weren't going to breakdown when we needed them.</sentence><sentence id="84">And then on about the 16th or 17th of December -- I'm skipping over.</sentence><sentence id="85">We had a few trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and I did get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in what they called a <span class="DLF">buzz bomb alley</span> where there was a lot of damage, and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> one night, and when some buzz bombs came in, we could hear the explosions and see the flashes, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">anti-aircraft</span> was going off.</sentence><sentence id="86">So having been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during some of the attacks, we were getting a poor taste of what the war was going to be like.</sentence><sentence id="87">On the 16th or 17th of December we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wayland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and boarded an LST.</sentence><sentence id="88">It's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing ship tank</span> that were under the auspices of the U.S.Navy.</sentence><sentence id="89">And we really envied the navy guys because they had clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheets</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, and a good <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span>, good food, and a greatly enjoyed being guests of the Navy for that short cross of the <span class="DLF">channel</span>, which was just overnight.</sentence><sentence id="90">We landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span>, and then unloading the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> had an accident.</sentence><sentence id="91">We were the number three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> being loaded, and so we're almost the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> to unload.</sentence><sentence id="92">While the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">LST</span> had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basketball backboard</span> -- so when they didn't -- weren't carrying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, the crew could shoot baskets or something.</sentence><sentence id="93">Anyhow, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was under it, and the motion of unloading the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, the backboard had dropped loose, and it swung down.</sentence><sentence id="94">Well, our gunner reached up to move that so the <span class="DLF">hatch</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> wouldn't hit it.</sentence><sentence id="95">Our tank commander was down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> directing our driver to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> off the LST.</sentence><sentence id="96">Well, just as our gunner, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> -- and most of these guys I refer to them by their last name -- had reached out to lift this up.</sentence><sentence id="97"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Martiburg</span> [ph] gave Trevy [ph] the signal to move out, and he did, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> caught his hand between this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">backboard</span> and the chariot top.</sentence><sentence id="98">And he crushed two or three fingers, and part of his hand.</sentence><sentence id="99">Well, this was a real medical emergency, and nobody's around to help, so we bypass the column, and delivered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">We picked up a motorcycle escort and drove through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span>, and had -- the motorcycle MP didn't realize the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> could go that fast.</sentence><sentence id="101">We had <span class="DLF">steel tracks</span>, and this was December, so it was cold weather, and they were cobblestone <span class="DLF">streets</span> with <span class="DLF">streetcar tracks</span> on them, and we were skidding and swerving.</sentence><sentence id="102">In fact, we made about two turns where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> went -- spint 360 degrees around before we changed directions.</sentence><sentence id="103">And, in fact, we almost ran over another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="104">The M-view was directing traffic, and he let the -- our escort come through, and he put up his hand for us to stop, and we weren't stopping, and he scrambled to get out of the way, and then we had two motorcycle escorts.</sentence><sentence id="105">Well, we got to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and I had the distinction of being -- delivering the first patient ever by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">And I actually carried <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edmonton</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">He was a small slight man, older than the rest of us, he was in our mid to late 30's, and we didn't see him until the war was over, and heard that he had lost two fingers and part of the palm of his hand.</sentence><sentence id="108">Then we got back to the company, and loaded up with gas and ammunition, because at this point we didn't know that there was a battle in the Bulge.</sentence><sentence id="109">We were originally scheduled to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> and help -- well, sort of contain about 10,000 Germans that had been bypassed, and this was sort of our introduction to combat.</sentence><sentence id="110">We weren't going to go in and capture them, but we weren't going to let them come out either.</sentence><sentence id="111">They had live</sentence><sentence id="113">ammunition, we had live ammunition, we shot, we killed, but we were just going to make sure that they didn't move.</sentence><sentence id="114">That was the original plans that we had.</sentence><sentence id="115">Well, they changed that when the Battle of the Bulge started, and they gave orders to our division to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sibret</span> directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">This was a -- I'd say a force -- it was a force smart.</sentence><sentence id="117">We drove until we ran out of gas, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came by, handed up a gas can, we loaded up and kept going.</sentence><sentence id="118">We drove through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> -- oh, this must have been about the 24th -- 23rd, 24th.</sentence><sentence id="119">I want to say it was the 24th of December, Christmas Eve.</sentence><sentence id="120">Now the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> knew about the Battle of the Bulge.</sentence><sentence id="121">They knew the German breakthrough, and we were being inundated with propaganda, that the Germans were going to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> by Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="122">Well, the American Armored Division is a pretty impressive show of force to drive through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were out on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span>, there were eight and ten <span class="DLF">gates</span>, they were trying to climb up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> giving us eggs and flowers and fruit.</sentence><sentence id="123">Everything we wanted, but our orders were not to stop, very specific not to stop.</sentence><sentence id="124">I remember driving up to the Arc of Triumph and making a sharp left turn, and drove on through to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanson</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And all the time it was just hurry, keep going, keep going.</sentence><sentence id="126">It's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanson</span> they gave us a break to do some maintenance on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, and I shouldn't use that word "break," because we had to work awfully hard.</sentence><sentence id="127">We had to break -- take the <span class="DLF">track</span> apart, and take the connectors that linked each section of <span class="DLF">track</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">These come off as a big one-inch nut on it, and you have to take that apart, take that off, then with a sledgehammer knock the connector off.</sentence><sentence id="129">And then we put on a new connector or an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">extender</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">We call them duckbills, which would extend the width of the <span class="DLF">track</span> about four to five inches.</sentence><sentence id="131">And, again, these have to be put on with a sledgehammer, and then the nuts put back on and tightened up, and it was not easy work; heavy physical work, as well as track -- threading that track up over the drive wheels and sprockets of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">They had promised us a turkey dinner for Christmas day, and they delivered it.</sentence><sentence id="133">We got turkey, but that was all we got, turkey and bread; no fixings, but we had turkey.</sentence><sentence id="134">Well, at this point they discovered that our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, this is <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank A3</span>, had a bad transmission and so the rest of the division went on, and we stayed with ordinance while they repaired and eventually they replaced the transmission, and then they decided it was an engine problem; they replaced the engine.</sentence><sentence id="135">So the division went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neufchateau</span> and through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span>, and got into action very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="136">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> was behind, so we missed the first day -- first several days of action.</sentence><sentence id="137">In fact, when we got up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neufchateau</span>, they held us there until -- they thought the division was coming off the <span class="DLF">line</span>, and they didn't, so we were several days there.</sentence><sentence id="138">We didn't know where we were going to, just stayed put.</sentence><sentence id="139">I had some interesting stories as we were traveling by ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="140">I remember, this was now snow and ice, and I remember one little French boy, I would guess must have been seven or eight years old, about that high, came by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">He looked cold and miserable.</sentence><sentence id="142">We stopped, and put some wool socks on him, and a hat, and gave him some candy bars, and muffled him up as best as we could, but we had to go, but he did look like a very forlorn waif by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">Then as we were driving beyond here,</sentence><sentence id="145">now we're in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, in that <span class="DLF">line</span> there, a one-lane road, and it had sort of a crown on it to help drainage, but it was all ice and snow, and it was snowing.</sentence><sentence id="146">This was very tricky driving, because if we kept the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> balanced on the top of the crown, we made good progress.</sentence><sentence id="147">If it was off balance, we'd slide down to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> until we hit the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and got some soft dirt, and then the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> would dig in and bring us up on top of the thing, but usually we'd go up too far and then we'd slide down the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">So we were going down the <span class="DLF">road</span> like this, up one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, down the other.</sentence><sentence id="149">This was all right until we noticed that along both sides of the <span class="DLF">road</span> there were these large <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and they were, oh, at least that big around.</sentence><sentence id="150">These <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were all notched, and they had little white boxes all wired around them.</sentence><sentence id="151">And we discovered later that these were boxes of TNT, and that was primer cord, and this whole <span class="DLF">road</span> had been mined like that in case the Germans did break through from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">They would have blown all these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and it would have been like jackstraws across that <span class="DLF">road</span>, and they would have been denied to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="153">This concerned me driving down that <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">First of all, we didn't -- we could see probably blowing that <span class="DLF">road</span> while we were there.</sentence><sentence id="155">All we could see is bumping into something and setting the whole thing up.</sentence><sentence id="156">So that was a harrowing experience.</sentence><sentence id="157">Then we caught up with the division, and as I said, we waited, and then we were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Longchamps</span> which is, oh, two or three kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span>, in and around that <span class="REGION">area</span>, and we -- our company became part of CCR.</sentence><sentence id="158">The 11th Armored Division was divide -- made up of three combat commands.</sentence><sentence id="159">Combat command CCA or CCB or CCR.</sentence><sentence id="160">And there could be any combination of battalions or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">companies</span> in either one depending on the mission.</sentence><sentence id="161">Well, the mission of Combat Command Ark, CCR, was to support whichever -- A or B -- had the main action; in case of any difficulty, we'd back them up, in case they broke through, then we were to go through the break and exploit it.</sentence><sentence id="162">So we were always moving here and there depending on what the action was.</sentence><sentence id="163">Sometimes we'd move three or four times during a night, maybe -- frequently, more than that, almost like a chess game, to get in position where we expected the German thrust to be.</sentence><sentence id="164">And I remember painting our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> white, or whitewashing them, so we could hardly see them with all that snow around, and it was very cold.</sentence><sentence id="165">Getting up in the morning, I'd take half three-quarters of an inch of gauze across the inside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">There's no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heaters</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, and we'd just be sitting there, and as long as one man was on the radio, the rest of us could sleep, so we'd take turns doing that, but it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="167">And sometimes we'd be in position.</sentence><sentence id="168">I remember one -- this little valley where the forward slope of the valley, and on the other side of the knoll was our German column.</sentence><sentence id="169">This morning at dawn, bright and clear, blue sky, it was beautiful, and our friends in the 19th ?</sentence><sentence id="170">Akal?</sentence><sentence id="171">Air Command came over with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">P-47s</span>, and attacked this German column.</sentence><sentence id="172">Now, the column was out of sight, it was on the other side of this <span class="DLF">hill</span>, but we could see the people dive down, we could see the machine guns going, we could see them drop bombs, and it actually disappeared around the crest of the <span class="DLF">hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">And after, oh, a half hour or so we got orders to move, that we were no longer</sentence><sentence id="175">needed there.</sentence><sentence id="176">Air Force had taken care of the threat, so we moved to another <span class="NPIP">position</span>, but that was a lot of the kinds of activity we were doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
