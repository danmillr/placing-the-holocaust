<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Father was a very elegant, very kind, wonderful man.</sentence><sentence id="78">Mother had a great big responsibility to take care of the four children, because Father was travelling a lot to business.</sentence><sentence id="79">Actually every week, went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">He had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="81">And so Mother had a hard responsibility to raising the children; and she was, | think, very stern, very demanding.</sentence><sentence id="82">We had to know always who we are, and there were a lot of restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="83">And, you know, when you're young and...and separate so tragically as we separated, you really don't have a good picture at all.</sentence><sentence id="84">You don't...you have a very distorted picture, of your mother particularly.</sentence><sentence id="85">Uh, you didn't came to terms about how you was accepted, or...or...so that it's very hard for me to give any kind of picture of Mother.</sentence><sentence id="86">I just remember one of my rebellious natures about her.</sentence><sentence id="87">On Mother's Day, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was asked always to...children were in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> asked to perform; and I remember the last Mother's Day, I got a poem about a very soft, gentle, loving mother.</sentence><sentence id="88">And I felt, "It's a mockery.</sentence><sentence id="89">This is not my mother, and I will not read this poem!"</sentence><sentence id="90">And I chose a poem about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> that are cut so suddenly down, and it's a very beautiful poem.</sentence><sentence id="91">Until today I remember, because I didn't told my teacher.</sentence><sentence id="92">I didn't told anybody that I</sentence><sentence id="94">will change the script, and I will just say this poem about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> that are cut down so terribly harshly, and what is their sin.</sentence><sentence id="95">Almost like I would speak about our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> that was taken away so suddenly.</sentence><sentence id="96">So the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> almost replaced this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">But, of course, we did not know anything nearer to it before, what will happen to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">But the poem was so interestingly prophetic about this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that it will be erad...eradicated; and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> will all gone and the...and the birds will not sing anymore, and what is the sin of this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>?</sentence><sentence id="99">So you can imagine the surprise of my mother, the surprise of my teacher, when I'm coming and talking about the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">So you... you see, I wasn't clear, really, about the mother.</sentence><sentence id="101">If I could fashion her that time, probably I would made her extremely tender, extremely soft; but later I knew how important it was that she was firm and stern, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was so horrible.</sentence><sentence id="102">And it was almost her sternness, her demands were almost an education in survival, in a way.</sentence><sentence id="103">I don't know how to tell you that.</sentence><sentence id="104">But in very early stage of...of the tragic upheaval in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, a drunk man came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and says, "You know, you will all be taken out, and you will be all...all be burning up, and so....".</sentence><sentence id="105">He said some horrible words.</sentence><sentence id="106">And I got so frightened, I pretended that I faint.</sentence><sentence id="107">I just was...it was...just fell down.</sentence><sentence id="108">And Mother--instead of taking care of this man, taking him out from <span class="BUILDING">household</span>--she came over first and slapped my face, and said, "In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we don't faint."</sentence><sentence id="109">Well, that was good education in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> we didn't fainted either.</sentence><sentence id="110">And so maybe in that respect, if I...[ should apologize to my wonderful mother who really gave me a little survival instincts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: Tell me about your.... Here's a kleenex.</sentence><sentence id="154">Tell me about your brothers and sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>

So in a way, we started to be very independent and kind of rebellious, and continued to do that even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">And...and sure enough, we had the children there.</sentence><sentence id="357">And one day the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens as we are singing and the children are in a circle, and Mother comes in with a bowl of cherries.</sentence><sentence id="358">She went to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">They let her out, and she brought the bowl of cherries to us.</sentence><sentence id="360">So she knew all the time what we are doing; and those were the most wonderful cherries I ever had.</sentence><sentence id="361">I never, never had anything so wonderful since then.</sentence><sentence id="362">And so, Mother knew Edith and I were the kindergarten teachers of these children; and it was now official that we took care of the children.</sentence><sentence id="365">So one day they say that (cough)...now, that special ...special permission is not granted anymore.</sentence><sentence id="366">We also going over to the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">And we went over, and...for one night, and we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>; and the next morning they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">Marching through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was like a scene out of the Bible.</sentence><sentence id="369">From ancient time.</sentence><sentence id="370">I could not tell you the humiliation I felt; carrying our baggage, passing our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, looking into our <span class="DLF">window</span>, seeing the people who occupied our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looking at us, and nobody stopping.</sentence><sentence id="371">They marched us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">Nobody says, "Come on.</sentence><sentence id="373">You cannot do it."</sentence><sentence id="374">On a June day, 1944, 20th century men cannot be just taken from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, from their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, from their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, from their belonging, marched into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span>, seventy people.
