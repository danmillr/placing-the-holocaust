<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Now, you had a nickname, didn't you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: No, it wasn't a n-nickname, it was the diminutive, which is often done in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, to take the ending of the name itself.</sentence><sentence id="30">So Isaac is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saaco</span>, and it got shortened to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zako</span>, and that's how I was known by my parents, my brothers, and friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: And this was when you were very -- as -- as a young kid, I gather, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Now when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="48">A: I was born in 1926, April 29.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: And you were born where?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">My parents had migrated from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they were born, which was at that time, when they were born, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastir</span>, part of the Ottoman Empire.</sentence><sentence id="54">And after the first World War, they left because the conditions there were terrible, and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and that's where I was born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: L-Let's -- let's talk a little bit about what it was like to grow up in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and what it was like in particular in your family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="60">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: First let's talk about your parents, and then we'll go to your two siblings.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: All right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: T-Tell me about your father and your mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: My father was -- when I began to understand the situation, my father was an accountant.</sentence><sentence id="69">He was th-the chief accountant of a very large company that dealt in -- in importing textiles, and selling wholesale.</sentence><sentence id="70">My father was lame because he had polio as a young child, and essentially almost a club foot, which had then to be corrected in an operation that took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, when he was a teenager.</sentence><sentence id="71">And he stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and did -- studied accounting.</sentence><sentence id="72">My mother was a -- a teacher in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where she was born, in an <span class="BUILDING">Alliance Frangaise school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">So, because they both very proficient in French, then it was compulsory to speak French at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">Between themselves, my parents talked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladino</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judeo-Espagnol</span>, which I had to do also with my maternal grandmother, when she visited us, because that's the only language she knew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Now, did your parents come from a wealthy background, I mean, your father had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and having medical care there, as well as studying, or -- or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, it's interesting that you ask that, because it's now that I'm finding out, through some of the work that I have done for the -- for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, about my parent's backgrounds, and very slowly I -- I have found out, that especially in my father's family, they were very prominent.</sentence><sentence id="85">Both, I think, in financially, but also as leaders of a community.</sentence><sentence id="86">My great-grandfather, Solomon, was one of the first 13 signatures in 1864 to open Alliance-Frangaise schools in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastir</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">My grandfather Isaac, whose name I bear, which was another tradition in <span class="BUILDING">Sephardic homes</span>, was a president of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastir</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">And my Uncle Solomon, who was my father's eldest brother, was president of the Joint Distribution Committee.</sentence><sentence id="89">So, apparently they must have been a very prominent family.</sentence><sentence id="90">My grandfather -- and I still remember a letterhead, it was in several languages, but the one that I remember was in French, fournisseur de l'armee</sentence><sentence id="92">turque.</sentence><sentence id="93">And we see he used to s -- to sell goods to the Turkish army.</sentence><sentence id="94">Grain, and other material, not -- not weapons, but -- so they had been in that business for a long time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: So wha -- it's -- i -- why did it take you so long to find out, did your father not tell you about the history of the family, or --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: He -- you see, you have to remember, | think in Europe generally, avi was something peculiar to my family, parents don't exchange a lot of confidences when you're young.</sentence><sentence id="111">Things immediately change, magically, when you reach manhood, or adulthood in -- in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="112">And then you become a friend, and things then open up.</sentence><sentence id="113">You see, I left <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> when I was 19, to come to study in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, so I didn't have the opportunity to engage my father in reminiscences, so my brother -- younger brother, who stayed with my father until my father's death in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, he knows much more sometimes, about stories that my father told him, than I had an opportunity to do -- to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="118">Q: So tell me what sort of a person your father was as a father to you.</sentence><sentence id="119">Wer -- were -- did you -- would you have considered yourself close, prior to the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Yes, well not really close, again, because of what I mentioned before.</sentence><sentence id="123">We were not distant, but my father was a -- a very even tempered individual.</sentence><sentence id="124">He encouraged me in my studies.</sentence><sentence id="125">He insisted to review my homework even, I think, when I first went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">There were things that he had no notion at all, whether mathematics, or physics, and yet he insisted to review the homework.</sentence><sentence id="127">I -- by contrast, my mother was a -- a very demanding person.</sentence><sentence id="128">Having been a teacher, and also temperamentally, she asked of me to do things -- to excel, to study my f -- French lessons, to practice -- at one time I started learning the violin at the <span class="BUILDING">Athens Conservatory</span>, but the war put an end to all of that, so I didn't pursue that instrument.</sentence><sentence id="129">So there was always a contrast.</sentence><sentence id="130">My -- my mother was much more demanding individual, my father a much more even tempered, but still expecting things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="141">And -- and would you say that as a child you felt close t -- though they weren't sharing information with you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Right, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: -- were you able to come to them with difficulties, or -- or were -- would you talk to your friends about those kinds of things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: No, I would -- up to a certain point, then ev -- eventually I would have to learn to talk to my -- my parents, but I would talk to my mother, because I lived all day long with -- with her, and it was almost a natural thing for me, the first person to think of telling her about something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And it would be her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: It'd be her, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="160">Q: Did you go -- y -- s -- when we wer -- drove here in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, you talked about taking your kids for a walk.</sentence><sentence id="161">Did your father and mother go for walks with you, and -- and do things with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="164">A: My father did not, because -- as I mentioned before, because of his lameness.</sentence><sentence id="165">My mother took me about four or five blocks away from -- from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we -- I grew up.</sentence><sentence id="166">There was a little <span class="DLF">park</span>, and then she would take us, I'm sure when I was very young.</sentence><sentence id="167">Later on, when I reached the age of 10, I then started taking my younger brother on walks.</sentence><sentence id="168">Another thing that I remember we did very frequently was -- as I said, my maternal grandmother visited us twice a week, she lived with a -- an aunt.</sentence><sentence id="169">And it was really for an able person, it was let's say, a 15 minute walk.</sentence><sentence id="170">But for my grandmother, it turn out to be maybe a half an hour, or a little bit more, because she was older, and she would have to rest from time to time.</sentence><sentence id="171">And the little <span class="DLF">park</span> was on the way, so we're -- I would go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">keropper</span>, and we would eventually reach the <span class="DLF">park</span>, sit at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, let her rest.</sentence><sentence id="172">And my mother would come sometimes together.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: When di -- because I didn't know this, when -- when did you start violin lessons?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="184">A: Oh, I started violin lessons when I was eight or nine years old, maybe 10.</sentence><sentence id="185">But I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was four, the reason being that that was when my second brother was born, Samuel.</sentence><sentence id="186">And I don't know, perhaps I was too much, and my mother needed to have free time to care for my brother.</sentence><sentence id="187">She knew the teacher in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, which was around the corner from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">So she asked her if sh -- I could go there for a few hours, just sort of to be kept, and not to interfere with the house affairs.</sentence><sentence id="189">But apparently I must have picked up, because there from then on, I continued, and I went to -- to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">But I think usually at the end of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, then my actual age would be apparent to the teachers.</sentence><sentence id="191">So the first six years of <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> -- at the time I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was six years primary, six years <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, or <span class="BUILDING">gimnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="192">For the first seven years of sc -- of schooling, I changed <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every year, because -- for the reason I mentioned before, they would find out from my behavior I was a lot younger than -- than my grade, and they would wo -- washme -- wanted me to -- to remain for another year in the same grade, but of course, my parents did not want to do that, and I continued.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: And your violin came in the midst of this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: The violin came -- yes, I started with a -- a private teacher, who lived a few blocks from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, for about a year.</sentence><sentence id="205">And then my parents decided that I ought to go to the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span>, and I had to give an audition, and I was then admitted, and I started studying.</sentence><sentence id="206">I have -- I have to change, because now I remember, | started in 1939, so I was about 13 then.</sentence><sentence id="207">The reason I'm saying that now, in recollection, was because I was at the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> for two years -- two and a half years, and then after the -- the occupation, after the war, it closed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: It closed for a -- at least a year, year and a half, that's what interrupted the violin lessons.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So you were very good to go to <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span>, no?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="221">A: Well, but for only a year, year and a half, I didn't reach any exalted levels.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="223">Q: Did you love it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: At that time I did.</sentence><sentence id="226">The violin is a very hard instrument, and to -- to -- to make it make a pleasant sound, it -- the technique in itself is very hard.</sentence><sentence id="227">I had a boyhood -- childhood friend, two years older than I, Saby Shabetai, he lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above ours.</sentence><sentence id="228">And when I would eg -- do exercises, then the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open, and then from time to time he would shout and tell me to stop that horrible sound.</sentence><sentence id="229">But I -- I persevered, but the war put an end to that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Right, right.</sentence><sentence id="236">And you have two brothers, Samuel, who was born in 1930, I believe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: In 1930, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: And --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: And the youngest, he was named Nehama, he was born in 1934.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="246">Tell me a little bit about Samuel.</sentence><sentence id="247">Was this hard for you, when the second brother -- you were four -- you were four years old when he --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: It wasn't hard --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: -- but I think it's -- I can see it in my own children and grandchildren, that the four age difference, for the first 10 - 15 years, is almost an -- an unbridgeable <span class="DLF">gap</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">You have different friends.</sentence><sentence id="257">I -- I -- I didn't have, I ca -- as I recall, any problems with my younger brother, but I wasn't really that close to him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: But in contrast, with the youngest brother -- let me call him Meko, because that's how we -- we called him, from the diminutive Nehameko, I was much closer to him.</sentence><sentence id="264">I was sort of his protector.</sentence><sentence id="265">I would take him for walks to the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">I would sometimes supervise the first lessons that he had in going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">And this is how we were growing up.</sentence><sentence id="268">I'm -- I'm sure that a little bit later on, if -- if things had not happened w-what actually happened, I would have been friendly with all of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="275">Q: All of them.</sentence><sentence id="276">How do you account for being so close, or wanting to do things with the littlest one, and not with the one [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: I think simply that -- that I thought it was a natural thing.</sentence><sentence id="283">I -- I don't think I was asked by my mother, but simply I -- I felt that it was a natural role to play, because I was now big enough to protect him if he would go out and play, if another kid would attempt to beat him up, I would be around to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: -- to protect him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: It was just a -- a role I -- | -- I fell into naturally.</sentence><sentence id="293">I don't think I was asked to do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Was yours a <span class="BUILDING">religious household</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: We were observant in all the Jewish traditions, I'm talking the Sabbath, and of course, all the holidays.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: So you observed the Sabbath?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Yes, I think at the age of five and on, my Friday chore, before the actual Sabbath started, was to deliver a bottle of olive oil to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, because in <span class="BUILDING">Sephardic synagogues</span>, there are no candles.</sentence><sentence id="303">Everything is in glass containers with olive oil and wicks that burn.</sentence><sentence id="304">And the thing that you do is to keep the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> supplied with oil.</sentence><sentence id="305">And since it was so near my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, then I would be asked to deliver a -- a bottle of oil.</sentence><sentence id="306">Also, my memories, both of the Sabbath, and -- and -- and the major holidays, they are visual, oral, and olfactory, because Friday afternoon, before the onset of Sabbath, when the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> were closed, the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were waxed, and I still remember the -- the wax smell, which wa-was indicative of the preparations for the Sabbath.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: And do you remember the smell of food, specific food?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: A little bit at times.</sentence><sentence id="315">I have more visual memory of the dishes that my mother cooked.</sentence><sentence id="316">Some of them were, at least visually, very attractive.</sentence><sentence id="317">And I also le -- remember at times when she would do a number of desserts that required the rolling of dough to a very thin layer, which today you can buy at the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, it's called phylo -- phylo, which is a Greek word.</sentence><sentence id="318">But in those days, she did it, and if you don't -- you cannot roll it, you roll it up to a certain point, and then I remember she wore a sleeveless dress, and would powder her arms with flour, and then get under the dough and begin to pull it from every <span class="NPIP">corner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">And you have to be very careful.</sentence><sentence id="320">Very often it would break, and there's nothing you can do.</sentence><sentence id="321">You would have to start all over again.</sentence><sentence id="322">So I remember these things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Now, in the Sephardic tradition, are there particular kinds of Jewish dishes within that tradition?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="336">A No, I don't think it's a Sephardic tradition so much, as it is the tradition of the <span class="REGION">territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="337">I think that if you take the cuisine that I think my mother -- first of all, I think because of the way she was taught, butter was never used.</sentence><sentence id="338">I don't remember seeing butter in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="347">A: Yes, it was -- first of all, you wanted to avoid having butter, in case inadvertently you used it with a -- a meat dish.</sentence><sentence id="348">But it was partly that, partly that both in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and in where she was born, there is not much dairy.</sentence><sentence id="349">At least -- <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> is not a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with lots of <span class="REGION">dairy land</span> to grow cattle to produce dairy products.</sentence><sentence id="350">Ev-Everybody cooks with olive oil.</sentence><sentence id="351">So there's a tremendous similarity.</sentence><sentence id="352">So, the -- the infusion is p-partly Mediterranean, partly Turkish, partly Greek cuisine, but I think in -- in my mother's case, there are some remnants of dishes that hark back, I think, from the 14" or 15" century in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, because they were descendants of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="359">Q: You were -- were you going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on a regular basis, or more --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: Every Saturday.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="363">Q: Every Saturday you went?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="365">A: Every Saturday.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="367">Q: And did your mother also go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="370">Now, I don't know if she went every Saturday, but a -- frequently -- certainly the holidays she went.</sentence><sentence id="371">And perhaps you know that in <span class="BUILDING">Sephardic synagogues</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's section</span> is usually a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> that's above it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="375">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="377">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Did you ever question that when you were a kid?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="797">A: -- because the -- the people came sort of in waves.</sentence><sentence id="798">I-It was -- we received in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="799">In those days I think nobody would go and -- and -- and engage a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> someplace, and -- and -- for guests.</sentence><sentence id="800">So I think people know that they had to stagger, so they came after the -- the ceremony in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, they came in continuous waves, that lasted practically all day long.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="829">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="831">Q: [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="832">So that must have been really frightening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="835">A: Well, it was frightening because for one thing, by -- by that time, we knew what had happened to Europe, what -- what ha -- what happened to Jews in particular, so we -- we knew it was not a good thing for us, all right?</sentence><sentence id="836">But again, th-there's another th -- aspect which becomes important for our story, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> was occupied by Italians.</sentence><sentence id="837">I think Hitler, as a sop to Mussolini, gave him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and a few other larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ci-cities</span>, and regions of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> to occupy.</sentence><sentence id="838">Unfortunately, well -- I don't know if that would have made it -- it may -- it might have made a difference.</sentence><sentence id="839"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> was under total German occupation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="845">Q: Right, right, and that means that the greatest number --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="849">Q: -- of Jews living in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> were under German occupation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="851">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="852">So, vi-visibly, of course we could see Germans, ma -- German soldiers, but Italians were a lot more visible.</sentence><sentence id="853">And all this would cha -- were issued, as any occupying authority does, promulgating laws, and things like this, always, although there was -- they were coming from the quisling government, the collaborating government, but generally it was according to the orders of -- and they would cite, in particular, Italian thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: So in "41 and 42, does your life change very much, or is there a kind of -- once the occupation starts, does it settle down?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="859">A: Well, it changed in many respects, but I -- I continue with <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I f -- I finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in -- in ?</sentence><sentence id="860">42.</sentence><sentence id="861">The winter of "41 to "42, which was the first winter under occupation, turn out to be the most terrible winter of the occupation from the standpoint of famine.</sentence><sentence id="862">For the first time, you know, we had begun to see weak people who had fallen in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and gradually even some of them who were left there, and some of them dead.</sentence><sentence id="863">So it was a very, very -- and it -- it -- be -- coincidentally also, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, generally, had mild winters.</sentence><sentence id="864">I remember only once in my entire childhood remembering snow.</sentence><sentence id="865">Snow, it was only something that you read in books.</sentence><sentence id="866">And we woke up one day and the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> were a little white.</sentence><sentence id="867">And some of us went immediately to try to make a snowman, but the moment we reached the <span class="DLF">street</span>, the snow had melted.</sentence><sentence id="868">There wasn't very much left.</sentence><sentence id="869">But that was a very rough winter, it was very, very cold.</sentence><sentence id="870">There was no heating, lack of food.</sentence><sentence id="871">I think that probably what happened is that the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and other clandestine ways of getting food -- also, people didn't know what the occupying powers were going to do in grabbing hold of the agricultural produce that naturally came out of --</sentence><sentence id="873">6 out of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">But in -- in -- in short, it was a terrible winter, but then things begun to be better.</sentence><sentence id="875">We did not suffer very much in our family, because -- although we didn't get the kinds of foods that we were used to.</sentence><sentence id="876">Then I remember being sent by my mother to stand in -- on queues, in <span class="DLF">lines</span>, to buy a piece of feta, a piece of cheese.</sentence><sentence id="877">And sometimes we would stand on <span class="DLF">line</span> for hours only to -- to reach the <span class="DLF">door</span> practically, and then be told that there's no more |-left.</sentence><sentence id="878">So we spent a great deal of time like that.</sentence><sentence id="879">But I was not directly affected with it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">We had to be very careful, I -- we were advised and admonished by our teachers not to make any politically overt statements in class, for obvious reasons.</sentence><sentence id="881">But ho -- yor -- y-you knew that you were not entirely free to say what you wanted to, and you had to be very, very careful.</sentence><sentence id="882">There was no curfew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> because at least at that time it would have been almost impossible to enforce.</sentence><sentence id="883">A -- as soon as I finish hi -- <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in "42, normally I would have then taken the exams to get into the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span>, but it was closed.</sentence><sentence id="884">The <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="885">So I then, until the beginning of the Jewish persecution in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, I worked for slightly over a year for a man who was in -- during the occupation there was a clan-clan-clandestine stock exchange.</sentence><sentence id="886">We're not talking about stocks, or bonds, or -- the only means of transaction, the only thing that was transacted was gold.</sentence><sentence id="887">Gold coins, English sovereigns, French gold francs, Swedish francs, and occasionally bars, small bars of gold.</sentence><sentence id="888">And this <span class="BUILDING">market</span> was obviously entirely underground, because it was under penalty of death if you were caught with gold.</sentence><sentence id="889">The way the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> was done, it was strictly over the telephone.</sentence><sentence id="890">Somebody would call and -- in the morning and say, "I have 10 -- 10 liras," they used to be called collectively, "to sell, what is the asking price?"</sentence><sentence id="891">And this <span class="BUILDING">market</span> would fluctuate entirely on what would happen in the international news.</sentence><sentence id="892">If the Germans were winning, then the Greek drachma would lose even more of it's value.</sentence><sentence id="893">We talk about, by that time, a million drachmas, you know, it was -- millions was just like to buy some candy.</sentence><sentence id="894">If the allies were winning, on the contrary, then the drachma would rise, because you know, naturally people thought that with the allied side winning, then the days of liberation for <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> would come, and therefore the drachma would gain, you know, gain value.</sentence><sentence id="895">So that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="896">I mean, I would then -- my -- my -- my -- the -- the man I worked for would be the middle man.</sentence><sentence id="897">He would then sell -- get a buyer, get a seller.</sentence><sentence id="898">And then I would then have to from time to time, deliver the goods, which were rolls, maybe of 10 silver coins, and I would deliver them to the -- go pick them up, and -- and deliver them.</sentence><sentence id="899">And it was, you know, it was a dangerous thing, because if I was fa -- fa -- if I were found out, then it would have been terrible.</sentence><sentence id="900">But I was not found out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: There was no propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="952">There were -- especially in that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="953">I -- I -- I think it was too early.</sentence><sentence id="954">There was not enough time for the occupying forces to begin something overt that would trickle down into the lessons themselves.</sentence><sentence id="955">I mean, what we were -- as I said, admonished by our teachers not to do, is not to make overt statements against the</sentence><sentence id="957">7 occupying powers.</sentence><sentence id="958">Even in -- in jest, you know, for obvious reasons.</sentence><sentence id="959">But there was no -- no effect -- no visible effect.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="994">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="996">A: Because the <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> continued, and then there was no -- they didn't shut down any <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="997">Again, I -- it -- it requires emphasis to contrast it with not only what happened afterwards, but also with the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, in that there were no effect on Jewish businesses.</sentence><sentence id="998">The Italians didn't shut any -- anything down.</sentence><sentence id="999">So there -- the <span class="BUILDING">textile firm</span> continued, and my father continued.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1010">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And -- and you see, I'm -- I'm -- I'm -- we begun to hear not only stories, but things which I remember y -- I knew my parents were discussing.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Very early after the occupation, in the fall of "41, the Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> conscripted all males, I think between the age of 18 to 45 or 50, and they were taken into forced labor along the <span class="DLF">Greek Bulgarian border</span> to do road work.</sentence><sentence id="1013">I think it was primarily harassment.</sentence><sentence id="1014">And I remember wer -- of course lots of conversations that my parents and their friends are discussing a delegation from a number of prominent Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, including I think the rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corats</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1015">And after a few weeks they came back, and there was a deal struck, apparently, where a head toll had to be paid to sort of get th- those Jews -- Salonika Jews, released from the forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="1016">But you see, the -- again, these things are happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1017">The things trickle down, or come down relatively quickly, but the Italians refused to do -- to take any anti-Jewish me -- measures.</sentence><sentence id="1018">If I -- I have looked into that.</sentence><sentence id="1019">I -- very often, I -- I t -- | say to my children, other people that I think I survived because the Italians did not enforce.</sentence><sentence id="1020">I have spoken to a number of people, some of them even s -- students of that period, and no -- knowledgeable.</sentence><sentence id="1021">They ascribe to the f -- these thing to the fact that the Italian army refused to take any political measures.</sentence><sentence id="1022">So they say it was not an attempt to save Jews, but because simply they refused to get involved politically.</sentence><sentence id="1023">However, now I have read, and I have seen tremendous instances where Italians, and the only ones were army contingents, really did go out of the way to save Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1024">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> was fortunate in that regard.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1131">A: That was most prominent thing.</sentence><sentence id="1132">So we go -- get into "42 now, and the only thing that we are able to learn forst -- firsthand, because from the radio, which is under control of the Italians and Germans, of course, you -- you're not going to learn anything.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And the newspapers also, were all of them simply writing handouts, and nobody would write anything that was in any contradi -- but of course we knew from other sources, including listening to foreign broadcasts about how the war is going, and -- and you know that until late deg42, things were not very good for -- for the allies.</sentence><sentence id="1134">But there was nothing until the beginning of "43, when in very quick succession, we began to hear about things which really were not only palpably true, but were very close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Perhaps we will come to that point if you ask me again in the beginning of "43, but I can re-remember palpably, around the beginning or -- or end of March of "43, and beginning of April 43, suddenly a -- a -- the -- my parents look was dark, and didn't change.</sentence><sentence id="1136">It was not something that was temporary that something was bothering them, or something like this.</sentence><sentence id="1137">It just -- something descended, a pall.</sentence><sentence id="1138">Now, we were not told about it, but I now, in retrospect, and I think I know that the fate of the relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastir</span>, which occurred -- the fateful day was 11 March, deg43, which I know subsequently, and the Salonika -- the expulsion of the Jews</sentence><sentence id="1140">1 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> took place early April of "43.</sentence><sentence id="1141">That was just the beginning, for me at any rate, of an extremely visible effect that I saw, and I began to feel, but it was vague, because no one knew at that time about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1142">The story was relocation, which of course, that's what the Germans were giving out.</sentence><sentence id="1143">But definitely, that's -- something like that, that I -- I -- I -- I know was a -- a tremendous change, which lasted, of course, and persisted.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1637">A: I'm sure there might have been, but it was not as regular as it's done in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or even other parts of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1638">But, if you talk about -- particular about the Jewish population --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1641">Q: lam.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1643">A: Now recall that in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>, births and deaths were registered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, but also with the Greek authorities.</sentence><sentence id="1644">So it was known --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1647">Q: Who was Jewish --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1649">A: -- for example -- yes, because these were remnants in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and in -- in -- in the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> of the 500 years of Ottoman rule, where not only the Jewish communities, the Greek communities under Ottoman rule, they were a se -- effectively self regulating, and self governing, except, of course, for matters of war, or crimes, or things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1650">But</sentence><sentence id="1652">0 Jews, or even Christians under Ottoman rule, if they had the dispute with -- as a business dispute with a partner, they didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">Turkish court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1653">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish court</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, that adjudicated things like that, which is a long tradition, as we all know in Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1661">Q: Now the reason why I'm asking is because does this mean that the Germans, when they come in, can easily get a list of who the Jews are, and where they're living?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1663">A Yes, the answer is, I think, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1664">Now, the list may not have been up to date, because effectively, some people who are coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> and other parts of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, because of the favorable atmosphere of the Italian occupation, they didn't necessarily go to the community and register.</sentence><sentence id="1665">I believe, but I am not entirely sure a-about what I'm going to say, that when the rabbi received the instruction to issue then a proclamation for the Jews to come and register, I think the paperwork also went with him.</sentence><sentence id="1666">So he -- he or -- or -- or other people in the community that went into hiding, hid --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1719">A Well, he tried to dissuade me, because he said that I am young, and this is not a -- a life that somebody of my age can cope with.</sentence><sentence id="1720">But I think when he saw that I was determined, he insisted that since in my travels I may have to go through <span class="DLF">checkpoints</span>, if somehow I were discovered, he begged me, in fact he insisted that I then run away on purpose so I could be shot and killed, so I would not fall alive in the hands of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1721">He -- he gave me some money to pay for my passage to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and parenthetically my friend had also asked me that -- that he had decided also to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, but his parents did not know, and he -- but he didn't have enough money for the fare, so I asked my father for that also.</sentence><sentence id="1722">I did not go to see my mother, because I th -- believed that it wasn't an attempt at dis -- dissuasion, that it would be something more emotional, that I possibly could not then handle.</sentence><sentence id="1723">And when I -- I -- I was concerned that she might succeed.</sentence><sentence id="1724">And since I was determined to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, I didn't go to see her, and this is something that I have regretted, and I will possibly regret forever, that I -- I didn't - - I didn't -- I didn't say good-bye to her.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1733">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1735">Q: How did you make the decision to go?</sentence><sentence id="1736">What -- what made you, since you weren't very political [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1739">A: Well, we knew -- y -- people know, because they talk -- you hear things.</sentence><sentence id="1740">First of all, people are shot at times because a German soldier was killed, assassinated by the resistance, then they grab people at -- at random, and shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="1741">And it was known, I mean, we knew that there was a part of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, generally in the northwestern part from the direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, in those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>, and that -- that there was a portion which, if I re-remember hearing maybe as early as the summer of "43, it was called free <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1742">And that's all that -- that I knew personally.</sentence><sentence id="1743">So when I made the decision, because I -- what led me to make this decision first of all is the negative factor that I couldn't possibly remain in hiding for goodness knew how long.</sentence><sentence id="1744">No one knew how long the -- the situation may last.</sentence><sentence id="1745">A few weeks, maybe a few months, it's something, but what if it's years?</sentence><sentence id="1746">So I -- I decided I have to get out some -- somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1747">So I said, all right, I'll go in the direction which I hear is free <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1748">When I talked with my friend, Thanassis, he was much more politically involved, something that I did not know until that moment, that yes, he also had decided to do that, and he wanted to join a specific group of the Greek resistance, known as the Zervas forces.</sentence><sentence id="1749">He knew that they were in a specific part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1750">So that's why we decided to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, which was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and -- and head to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1751">But from my standpoint that's all the information I -- I -- I had.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1778">A: Choice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1780">Q: Choice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1782">A: I--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1784">Q: Do you really regret having gone to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1785">You don't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1788">A: No, I'm alive because I went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1790">Q: You went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1792">A: No, I -- well, two things.</sentence><sentence id="1793">First of all -- or many things.</sentence><sentence id="1794">At times in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> I thought about -- I -- I thought about them continuously, but th -- I had no news.</sentence><sentence id="1795">But I thought instead about what was going to be after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1796">See, being the eldest child, and my mother was a rather dominant and strong willed individual.</sentence><sentence id="1797">We had clashes at -- at times.</sentence><sentence id="1798">And I remember them saying that well now, I w -- I -- I was growing up, now all these things were behind me, and how things were going to be a lot better, and I was really going to be now a magnificent child, that my mother will be proud of me and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1799">So there was a lot of that kind of a thing built up, which came crashing down when I found out that they were not around any more.</sentence><sentence id="1800">And then subsequently, from my brother, I learned that my mother was terribly worried about me, because she did not know where I was.</sentence><sentence id="1801">She had -- they had no news, no -- we could not communicate.</sentence><sentence id="1802">There was no way for me -- there were -- I couldn't write them a letter, for obvious reasons, and there were no Visitors in the -- especially in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> where I was, there was no one that I knew could g -- bring them news.</sentence><sentence id="1803">So all these things have a -- had a cumulative effect, and so since the regret -- I had the regret when I made the decision, and maybe a few days, and a few weeks, and a few months, and every time I think about it, it becomes bigger, because of other things that I've learned.</sentence><sentence id="1804">So it piles up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1818">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1819">But she knew that you were going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> because your father had [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1822">A: Of course my father -- now, [indecipherable] where my poor father, what did he know, other than I -- I was leaving, I was going to go in the direction somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1823">And --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1826">Q: And of course, he doesn't know --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1828">A: He doesn't know where I --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1830">Q: [indecipherable] you not make it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1832">A: No, of course not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1841">Q: So, in some ways you create a level of anxiety that you didn't want to create with people, but you had tried to make a decision that was best for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1843">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1844">A-And I ended up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and at the time where -- I'm not trying to rationalize or excuse it, it would have been almost impossible for me to even send word.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1847">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1849">A: For example -- perhaps we will come to that point later on when I got to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, because Thanassis decided not to stay, and then he -- he returned.</sentence><sentence id="1850">I did not dare tell Thanassis where my father was, because we were told, and enjoined when we had this family council, we were going to go into hiding, and other then because of need, like going and -- and -- and getting money, or seeing, you know, a -- a loved one, we are not to divulge where they are.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1853">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1855">A: And I said, I -- I know from my brother when they were caught by the Germans, they were beaten, because among other things, that -- that they wanted to do is to reveal where my whereabouts were, and where my father's where -- whereabouts were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1857">Q: So they knew you existed?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1867">Q: Was -- was there a s -- a network of people who were rescuing people, or were these really individuals that had been chosen by --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1869">A: Yeah, there was no network.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1871">Q: No network.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1873">A: We don't have anything, as in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, which was -- wasn't a network so much, but you know, an almost simultaneous reaction of putting all of the -- all -- 99 percent of the Danish Jews into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and ferrying them across to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1874">All these things were done, I think, on individual measures.</sentence><sentence id="1875">There were -- but there is no question that, for example, in the -- in the northern parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, I mean, I know that there were at times, attempts by the partisan forces, to encourage Jews to leave their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, which is not an easy thing to -- to do, but nevertheless, they -- they did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1886">Q: Were you frightened by your own decision, or were you excited that you were finally making a decision to do something, as opposed to waiting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1888">A: I was not excited in the sense of -- that I would -- I looked at it as an adventure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1890">Q: No [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1892">A: It was primarily, you know, a relief that at least I -- I wouldn't have to -- to live in hiding, and -- and be a burden on -- on these friends and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1894">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1896">A: But there was a great deal of uncertainty, which lasted for about a -- a few days, until my journey to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, because I went into an unknown.</sentence><sentence id="1897">I could have gone to a different <span class="REGION">region</span>, where I wouldn't have found anything.</sentence><sentence id="1898">Fortunately, I found this specific thing, and I -- and -- and before [indecipherable] got transformed, so I didn't go into this thing either as a, you know, a -- a -- a youthful adventure.</sentence><sentence id="1899">It was not all that, it was a -- a serious undertaking.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2287">A: There's no question that it was dominated by the -- the far left, because they were the best organized group of resistance, but EAM ala -- EAM was the <span class="REGION">political side</span>, and ELAS was the -- the <span class="REGION">military side</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2732">A: Look, I don't think we spoke very much.</sentence><sentence id="2733">I mean, occasionally the conversation would come back, because later on, when I was part of a real, ongoing military unit, after thes -- this mission of -- that I returned from.</sentence><sentence id="2734">And there was a large contingent of <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span>, where we were really living, and staying together, and talking.</sentence><sentence id="2735">Then we started exchanging, but in the first month or two, most of the time we are talking about is -- first of all, the next preoccupation, or the only preoccupation is what are you going to eat, because there is no food to be had there.</sentence><sentence id="2736">This is not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> where you're going to go for chow, when something rings, you have to scrounge for things.</sentence><sentence id="2737">So most of the th -- of the time, and necessarily is you're thinking about only one thing, survival.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2750">A: Failed mission.</sentence><sentence id="2751">Very briefly we went to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, I approached the

the evening.</sentence><sentence id="2754">They were a little skittish I could see in their eyes of that -- of having to b -- to also host two Italian officers, armed.</sentence><sentence id="2755">Because you got to remember, for the previous two years, that <span class="REGION">region</span> -- you know from time to time you would have incursions of Italians who would burn their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2756">I mean, I saw the rems of that, the hulks of -- of just nothing but <span class="DLF">walls</span> with -- with the open <span class="DLF">sky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2757">But at</sentence><sentence id="2759">0 least they did not a-attack us.</sentence><sentence id="2760">They would put us up.</sentence><sentence id="2761">But they wouldn't show up.</sentence><sentence id="2762">And although tried to get [indecipherable] would say again following morning, the long and the short is we went through two or three other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> with almost identical results.</sentence><sentence id="2763">But the -- the third or fourth <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, it was just, I think, after Christmas of "43, maybe December 28 or 29.</sentence><sentence id="2764">We got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and -- although the sa -- the story was the same tomorrow, but they didn't put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in that -- in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2765">Instead they guided us something like close to a half an hour walk from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2766">And in the middle of nowhere there was a little <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and it was two stories.</sentence><sentence id="2767">And in the lower part was a tethered donkey, and the upper was just a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, but it had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2768">So he says, "This is where you're going to -- to stay for your -- during your stay."</sentence><sentence id="2769">All right.</sentence><sentence id="2770">So that's where we slept the first night.</sentence><sentence id="2771">When we got up the following morning, it had begun to snow incessantly, which continued for a week.</sentence><sentence id="2772">Now, very quickly we were totally snowbound.</sentence><sentence id="2773">Fortunately -- I mean, the way we survived is once a day, around midday or so, a poor, elderly woman from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> would trudge all that distance, with a sack of roughly ground corn flour.</sentence><sentence id="2774">And that's our subsistence, we would take the corn flour and melt some snow, knead it into some kind of a dough, and pat it to a semblance of a bread, and then we would burn it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2775">That's what we ate.</sentence><sentence id="2776">Now, the -- I think the second week, she brought us an egg.</sentence><sentence id="2777">And we were, of course, you know, we haven't seen anything like this, and we were overjoyed, but very quickly we decided that it would be -- to divide it into three -- I mean, we would not even feel it in our mouths.</sentence><sentence id="2778">So we decided to keep it as a symbol of our eventual deliverance, both from the snow outside of that [indecipherable] the mission as well as the war, because -- and then I continue, very quickly, I mean we used the egg to play games with the mice.</sentence><sentence id="2779">The mice would come out at night, because it was the <span class="DLF">gallery</span> of all the [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2780">And we had not thought, we had left the egg someplace, and then in the glow of -- still of the fire -- we used to go out and gather branches, and burn them.</sentence><sentence id="2781">We saw how mice steal the egg.</sentence><sentence id="2782">One mouse takes it in it's paws, and sort of -- and the others drag it by the tail.</sentence><sentence id="2783">So we discovered the game, so we used to take the egg, and have bets made, and races.</sentence><sentence id="2784">We would leave it like this, and then we see the mouse come, and we say -- the bet was how fast he will get to the <span

spending all day long, we used to sing Italian songs.</sentence><sentence id="2785">And I clearly remember the first day that -- when the s-snow ended, it was the kind of a thing that you know when the snow clears, and the -- the <span class="DLF">sky</span> is completely s -- cloud free, and bright, blinding brightness because of the white, and we heard that drone of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, which was an incredible sound.</sentence><sentence id="2786">And we look up, and we see huge formations of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span>, which we di -- concluded couldn't be anything but allied, because the Germans didn't have very much of an air force.</sentence><sentence id="2787">And -- and -- and -- and I think in retrospect, because we -- I know I can tell you, I can -- the direction which they were flying, namely northeast, they probably were coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to bomb the <span class="DLF">oil fields</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploesti</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2788">So, you know, we could almost -- the kind of a thing that we all three of us looked up, and -- and sort of begged that the day will come for us very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="2789">So, after -- after the second week there, we, you know, concluded that we were not going to get anywhere, especially now since the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was covered with snow, even if things had changed, the attitude had changed.</sentence><sentence id="2790">So, we -- I had lost also a sense of orientation where we were.</sentence><sentence id="2791">Where is the nearest partisan unit?</sentence><sentence id="2792">We had been on the <span class="DLF">road</span> for practically a month.</sentence><sentence id="2793">So I was told, and we were pointed to some direction, and we got</sentence><sentence id="2795">1 there, and the first person I saw was Saby Shabetai,

filthy, in rags, you know, uncombed, literally dirty, because we had no means of bathing, washing, or anything like that, as well as, of course, hungry.</sentence><sentence id="2799">But -- so that's

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2860">A: Saby told me very quickly -- Saby, he was a very clever fellow, but he didn't have any training like I did.</sentence><sentence id="2861">He was two years older.</sentence><sentence id="2862">He became a spy.</sentence><sentence id="2863">And that was, he would -- he would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="39.559111" long="21.763917">Trikala</span>, wer -- w-wearing decent civilian clothes, and I guess he -- there must have been contacts, and he would stay with them, but he would -- the spy part was they try to find out movements.</sentence><sentence id="2864">Are there <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, or is there a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that's coming, passing, that's laden.</sentence><sentence id="2865">So that if there would be any action to be taken against either a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, or a con -- or -- or blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, [indecipherable], the British had much greater network of intelligence in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and all the major actions that took place was always because the British knew, and then they would -- they would agree with the guerrillas, to blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, or to destroy a <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, the [indecipherable] the most major action was done at the request of the British.</sentence><sentence id="2866">And a big <span class="DLF">viaduct</span> was blown up.</sentence><sentence id="2867">That was quite a few months before my arrival.</sentence><sentence id="2868">During my time, there were two actions of blowing up <span class="DLF">bridges</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where my regiment operated.</sentence><sentence id="2869">I was not involved in that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2915">A: Fortunately not, you know, the feet would get very, very cold, and the -- the -- the Italians, you know, maybe they had been taught, or they knew, they were much, of course, older than I am, to rub -- rub them with snow.</sentence><sentence id="2916">And if you do that, I don't think it's the rubbing with snow, but rubbing them fast, it just restores the blood circulation.</sentence><sentence id="2917">This is what you have to make sure, you know, fortunately I didn't get frostbite.</sentence><sentence id="2918">But three weeks after my arrival at <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, I got, you know, pleurisy, a very bad cold, I mean, when a little bit of fluid collects in -- in the pleura, not the lungs, but in the pleura.</sentence><sentence id="2919">And -- but there was a ni -- a little <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>, and had an Italian doctor, I can still remember him, he was a -- a short, very intelligent looking Sicilian.</sentence><sentence id="2920">He was almost entirely black, from brown skin, but very, very capable, very clever with -- practically had no facilities, but took care of his patients.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2963">A: After I got sick and recover, I was --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2965">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2967">A: -- because by that time, there was also another transformation that had taken place a few months before my arrival in the partisans, namely the partisans became organized as a modern army, with echelons, distinct divisions, regiments, battalions, companies.</sentence><sentence id="2968">At least on paper, all right?</sentence><sentence id="2969">And -- whereas before, these were independent units, marauding, doing whatever they could, but this was put on a much more professional footing, because by that time, the -- the man in command of the entire ELAS was General Sarafias, who was a professional military officer before the war.</sentence><sentence id="2970">So when I then was assigned to the regiment -- now the -- the regimental commander was a -- a man who permanent [indecipherable] was a major in the former Greek army, by the name of Karfis.</sentence><sentence id="2971">And he happened to have as an adjutant, a recent graduate of the military -- <span class="BUILDING">Greek military academy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2972">So he was the usual, you know, not spit and polish, because we didn't have the things for that, but saluting, although there wasn't s-so much saluting with the partisans, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2973">The method of addressing each other was synagonistis, which means fellow fighter.</sentence><sentence id="2974">It was -- it wasn't comrade, it wasn't mister.</sentence><sentence id="2975">It was even t -- with an officer of superior rank, you would address him as fellow fighter, and then his name.</sentence><sentence id="2976">So, because I think of the fact that my background, finishing <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, command of a language, and so forth, I was given a -- a clerical job, primarily enciphelment -- codes.</sentence><sentence id="2977">Because by that time, there were even radios, and nearby, because very near the <span class="BUILDING">regimental place</span>, there was the -- the <span class="DLF">airfield</span>, if I can call it that, it was just a bare piece of ground, but it was situated in the natural plateau, the one that I fired, remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2989">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2991">A: My first rifle.</sentence><sentence id="2992">And when in the su -- in the summer months, when the | -- <span class="REGION">land</span> was dry, then it was able to support the weight of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, and they would fly them over there, from <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, and for missions back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="2993">And because of the proximity, then there was a permanent detachment of British officers, liaison officers, that have been parachuted, or brought by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, next to our <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2994">So at times, I would then be asked to go -- I did not know English, but some of them, some of the English officers knew French, and I was able to converse.</sentence><sentence id="2995">Plus they were the only ones that had long range, short wave radios.</sentence><sentence id="2996">You know, the rest of -- I mean, the partisans, only division had a radio, and in our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> we didn't have a radio in the beginning, so everything had to be through again, field telephony.</sentence><sentence id="2997">But by then, it was necessary, because of certain engagements, to encode messages, and so I was pressed in that job.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3005">Q: Did you like that job?</sentence><sentence id="3006">Was it interesting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3009">A: Well, you know, no clerical job is interesting, everything becomes routine a little bit, but it was -- the thing that that -- am-amazed me is that after awhile, I didn't have to look at the decoding book to decode text.</sentence><sentence id="3010">I had begun to learn, and -- and visualize the -- the</sentence><sentence id="3012">4 decipherment -- th-the [indecipherable] and -- but I didn't -- I didn't want to sh -- people to see that, because, you know, I was told that -- that, you know, if you eventually memorize it, then -- then you -- if you are ever caught, then under torture you may reveal the codes, although I'm sure that the things that they had to communicate were not of momentous strategic im-importance to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3019">Q: But they would also change the codes</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3021">A: Yeah, but -- bu-but, you do that -- we didn't have -- in all that -- I'm talking about practically from February through November, practically the nine months that I -- my remain -- stayed with the partisans service, we changed codes routinely only twice.</sentence><sentence id="3022">So there wasn't that kind of a [indecipherable] because I don't think they were high level codes.</sentence><sentence id="3023">But they were important to us, and -- well, th-that was not the only thing I had to do.</sentence><sentence id="3024">Then the adjutant orders had to be typed.</sentence><sentence id="3025">We had -- we found a ramshackle <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span>, and some paper.</sentence><sentence id="3026">I was the only one who was able to use that and type some orders.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3033">Q: So you had learned typing, sort of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3035">A: Sort of.</sentence><sentence id="3036">More of the two or three fingers, which I still have to use today.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3039">Q: So, I've -- how are things now, is this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> now going out and doing sabotage, or is it quiet, and that's not what you're doing [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3041">A No, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="3042">Again, because it was <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> -- now, it's fighting units, and sabotage are in the <span class="REGION">region</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3043">I mean, if I drew a circle, it would probably cover, you know, a radius of 50 - 60 kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="3044">40 miles, you know, because the [indecipherable] adjacent things.</sentence><sentence id="3045">By that time, in the beginning of the partisan war, the major things that the partisans had to do -- wa-wanted to do, was A, kill known collaborators, primarily to elevate the morale of the people.</sentence><sentence id="3046">You know, begin to give them a sense that there are people who are protecting them.</sentence><sentence id="3047">That those who collaborate with the enemy are going to get their just desserts.</sentence><sentence id="3048">And because you cannot fight heavy engagements, there were occasional skirmishes, and fi -- and attacks with -- with isolated Italian, or -- or German units.</sentence><sentence id="3049">But in our <span class="REGION">sector</span>, when we begun to do a systematic thing of attacking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> because our unit was the nearest to the main <span class="DLF">road</span> that goes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="39.559111" long="21.763917">Trikala</span> to eventually <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kardhitsa</span>, and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lamia</span>, and so forth, to south [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3050">So that -- that was essentially the -- the -- the mission, if I can call it, of the regiment.</sentence><sentence id="3051">We -- we never got engaged.</sentence><sentence id="3052">We don't do that with the -- the light weapons.</sentence><sentence id="3053">The heaviest weapons I remember we had in the whole regiment was two heavy machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="3054">You can't engage an enemy that has armory units, with two heavy machine guns.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3069">Q: Okay, we've come to the end of the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3071">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="3074">5 Tape #7</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3080">Q: Are you getting news about the front?</sentence><sentence id="3081">I mean clearly the -- the -- there's a turn in the war, and there's been a turn in the war since 43, or late "42.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3084">A: Right, well, most of the spring, we knew -- first of all to us, through the British connection, primarily, as well as independently, the Greek connections, because of course, division talk to the agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, or the top command of ELAS.</sentence><sentence id="3085">So -- but it would come to us two or three weeks late.</sentence><sentence id="3086">So it primarily still involves the -- the campaign in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3087">The -- the great event occurs June six, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> occurs in the war.</sentence><sentence id="3088">We -- we get also news of the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3089">But that was the -- the -- the first major event.</sentence><sentence id="3090">That really didn't have an immediate effect, other than si -- psychological, that now these two great parts of the allies are converging.</sentence><sentence id="3091">But I think through a -- the stream of -- of messages coming from division, and from <span class="BUILDING">ELAS headquarters</span>, definitely show an increase in the pace of operations, for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="3092">First of all, visibly, from reports, Germans are abandoning smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, and concentrating in major <span class="DLF">arteries</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="3093">Why would they do that, since no -- no -- nobody thought that the <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> itself was about to be invaded by allied troops.</sentence><sentence id="3094">So -- so that was one -- one reason.</sentence><sentence id="3095">Then, also, the news began to -- to trickle down again.</sentence><sentence id="3096">We had more contact even from tiko partisans, who had much better communications, and already we began to see that the Russians are approaching the silent part of Europe, namely the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span>, and it doesn't take a strategic, Napoleonic mind, a short look at the map indicates that -- because <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> is al-almost like a peninsula, the bottom of the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span>, if the Russians were advancing that much, I think which eventually what happened is that the Germans would have an untenable position in this.</sentence><sentence id="3097">So, this explains why the Germans were consolidating their <span class="DLF">lines</span>, and because in the meantime, attempts had been made by the British mission to try to unite the warring factions of the Greek resistance.</sentence><sentence id="3098">And eventually, in the -- in June or July of "44, there was a -- as -- a signed agreement that was signed by representatives in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Lebanon</span>, I believe, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beirut</span>, which then held until the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3099">So -- so we had this pace going on.</sentence><sentence id="3100">But again, the day to day life for -- for us, food was very scarce, as usual, although it was <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span>, th-they didn't grow crops or -- or other food.</sentence><sentence id="3101">Also clothing, and -- and -- and sanitary conditions were not -- I mean, if you went to sleep at night, especially in -- in the winter, well in the middle of the night, you know, people are getting -- or you sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, people are getting up and stepping [indecipherable] sometimes on bodies, make their way to -- to go out, maybe to relieve themselves.</sentence><sentence id="3102">But very often it was not for that reason.</sentence><sentence id="3103">You would go up, and open the tunic to let the cold air come in to quiet the lice, because in sleeping ne -- bodies next to each other, the lice begin to get warm, and begin to -- to move, and you -- it's not particularly pleasant, and to quieten them again, you go out, open the tunic, let the cold in, and they quiet for a bit, and you sleep for another hour or two.</sentence><sentence id="3104">Th-This -- this -- this persisted until when it became real warm in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, May, June, and on, because then you could go bathe in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">streams</span>, and that would -- we used to do that every day, and at times it effectfully -- eventually happened to me later on, a month or two later, when I went swimming, and I had been perspiring, running to get to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to swim, and I must have caught a cold, which was then misdiagnosed as malaria, and I had other problems.</sentence><sentence id="3105">But this was -- the pace noticeably started.</sentence><sentence id="3106">There were more action from our</sentence><sentence id="3108">6 units in the [indecipherable], plus the -- the clear indication where they had come from <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span>, or from <span class="BUILDING">ELAS headquarters</span>, to harass Germans, even notably those who were retreating and going north, but not to attempt any major action, even if we were able to.</sentence><sentence id="3109">The reason being that they didn't want to infuriate the Germans, because fay -- they didn't really have to infuriate them, they were doing that anyhow in many cases, namely, a scorched earth policy, they attempted to blow up the <span class="DLF">port facilities</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pireas</span>, and it was only a last minute action by the partisans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, that averted the blowing up of <span class="DLF">port facilities</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pireas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3110">So -- so noticeably we saw the pace accelerate.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3158">A: Well, food was always, I think once a day.</sentence><sentence id="3159">And most of the time, because that which was -- was available were -- I still remember them, black eyed -- they look like black eyed peas, or black eyed beans.</sentence><sentence id="3160">But these were from old, even sometimes abandoned <span class="BUILDING">governmental warehouses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3161">There -- the villagers would make flour available, whatever they were able to do.</sentence><sentence id="3162">And those things were usually spoiled rotten, and you'd find little crawling worms <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, but not after boiling, we used to joke that we would eat meat also, while eating the -- the beans.</sentence><sentence id="3163">But, again, rel-relief would come from hunger in -- in the summertime, when -- because of vegetables [indecipherable] vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="3164">I forgot what you asked me --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3180">A: -- and that's where I learned to smoke, but we didn't have tobacco.</sentence><sentence id="3181">So you would take leaves from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and dry them, and crunch them, and usually find a piece of newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="3184">7 In -- in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were, a <span class="BUILDING">governmental warehouse</span> had been raided and tons, literally tons of contraband cigarette paper, which was -- used to be sold legally to roll cigarettes, had been found.</sentence><sentence id="3185">But because it had been contraband, it was so massive, you cannot burn paper so easily, as you know, even in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span>, if you put a book, it takes -- it's hard to burn it.</sentence><sentence id="3186">So, the government had fumigated these <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> with sulfur, which had permeated the cigarette paper, so if you use that, which was from some respects easy, but it stunk, and smelled, and tasted of sulfur so much, we use newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="3187">The problem with the newspaper is you take a puff, and it -- a flame at the end of the thing, instead of burning as a [indecipherable] a flame burning.</sentence><sentence id="3188">And this is the reason why, it was primarily to assuage hunger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3199">Q: So it was very difficult to actually do that --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3201">A: Right, right, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3211">Q: -- that people were supporting the partisans, or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3213">A: Oh yes, there is no question, because first of all, there is no question that without the support of the -- the people who had suffered a great deal, who also knew that harboring villagers, really almost invited punitive raids by the Italians, by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3214">And in spite of that they persisted, and without them I think no -- not only our movement, I think no partisan movement can possibly exist, survive, let alone thrive, and operate.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3305">A: Many, many tunes, you know, as you know, they came from partisan, Russian partisan songs, but with Greek words, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3307">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3308">Now you -- it's clear that the war is closing, but there is an -- an action that happens that's sort of by accident.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3313">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3315">A: Well very quickly, one -- one morning, if I -- I remember, it was close to 10 o'clock in the morning, and I was sort of manning the telephone, and it rang, and they asked the other -- at the other end, to speak to the colonel.</sentence><sentence id="3316">So, but I couldn't get the colonel, I got the adjutant.</sentence><sentence id="3317">Well, very quickly what tran-transpired, <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> was in a part that was really a short distance from the plains of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>, but it was a -- a suitable elevation.</sentence><sentence id="3318">And there was a -- a kind of like an <span class="DLF">entry</span>, a <span class="DLF">pass</span>, a <span class="DLF">mountain pass</span>, and essentially what the telephone call said is four or five or six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> have entered this pass, which had been manned by a very small unit of partisans, about five or six.</sentence><sentence id="3319">And we, of course knew that coming to the pass and going south, ended in a cul-de-sac, because there was nothing, after you've gone for another kilometer, just there was a w -- a <span class="DLF">mountain wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3320">So, when they saw that happening, you know, that's why they called to alert us.</sentence><sentence id="3321">They were not able, those who were guarding the pass, to engage how many Germans there would be, and the nearest unit that -- of a sufficient strength, was at least three or four hours away.</sentence><sentence id="3322">So very quickly the commanding officer decided that the [indecipherable] is to fool the Germans into thinking that they are surrounded, that there</sentence><sentence id="3324">0 are many more than actually we were.</sentence><sentence id="3325">So he dispatched anybody who could walk, including us clerical personnel in the regimental unit, to go, so we grabbed the -- our weapons, and after running for about 45 minutes, and out of breath, you could see down in that cul-de-sac, and all the -- the Germans had se -- literally circled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>, and some of them had gone hiding.</sentence><sentence id="3326">And as they were being fired by the unit that was guarding the pass, they would return -- was rifle fire, they didn't have anything heavy.</sentence><sentence id="3327">And so we started firing at them, and they were firing at us.</sentence><sentence id="3328">And they -- since they saw things coming from both directions, they really concluded that they were in -- in dire straights.</sentence><sentence id="3329">And we were afraid that they would communicate via radio to their original <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, and they would come to relieve them, with a much bigger force.</sentence><sentence id="3330">But apparently, they either didn't have radio, or if they had, they didn't know where they were, see, they got lost.</sentence><sentence id="3331">And by that time, in about three hours, or -- the main fighting unit came, and started -- the partisan unit, firing at the Germans, and then, after about a few minutes, you begin to see a white flag, but just before that happened, suddenly there was a little noise, or -- or -- or sound near where I was behind a rock.</sentence><sentence id="3332">And at the same time that I heard the sound, I also felt a -- kind of a -- of a pain, temporary pain in the right knee, and when I bend down I saw it was a tear, and something -- oozing a little bit of blood.</sentence><sentence id="3333">And it must have some part of a -- of a bullet that had hit a rock and splintered, and part of the thing ricocheted, but it didn't go <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, I didn't find anything, it wasn't a major wound, and it didn't hurt, but nev-nevertheless when I was taken to [indecipherable] I was bandaged by a woman who turned out to be a Jewish woman, who had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for midwives, with a -- a -- a young girl, who was next door neighbors to us.</sentence><sentence id="3334">So -- but it was the only action that I saw.</sentence><sentence id="3335">I mean we -- we -- the number of Germans killed was, I think, eight or nine, and two were wounded, they were carried out with a litter and three prisoner.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3367">Q: Did you hit anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3369">A: Oh ye -- you shoot -- you, first of all, we di -- we -- we didn't see -- we didn't shoot at the soldiers, because the only thing [indecipherable] was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, so we s -- we sh -- we aimed --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3371">Q: At the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3373">A: At -- at the -- not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> so much, but again, it was psychological to impress them that fire is coming from both directions, so they feel that they are trapped, and they -- which they were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3375">Q: What happened to these two guys that were captured [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3385">A: -- the two were -- I think one was a very young -- young fellow.</sentence><sentence id="3386">I can still remember, he must have been really almost my age, really -- at least he looked it -- like that.</sentence><sentence id="3387">And I remember he, all throughout the time that he's marched, and taken up to -- he's yelling German curses, which I do not understand, and heil Hitlers interspersed with German curses. [</sentence><sentence id="3388">indecipherable] And when we got there, he was then in-interviewed, or interrogated by this German solider, who came out, and he told me in French, because that's how I communicated with him, in French, that it was a hopeless case of a fanatic member of the Hitlerjugend, who -- and I think he was -- he was shot -- actually not shot, he was killed, but again, because of a bullet was a scarcity, I didn't see it, I didn't witness it, but the following day I was told that they had cut his throat.</sentence><sentence id="3389">Also, it would have been a little hard to carry, I mean, we be-began to be more ba -- mobile, and we didn't have the facilities to -- to carry extra.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3395">Q: Did they kill the other two?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3411">Q: [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3413">A: Yeah, a mix thing, but I mean at least the -- the -- the British -- they didn't incarcerate themselves, but they made arrangements with the local gendarmerie in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kardhitsa</span> to -- to guard them.</sentence><sentence id="3414">That's after we begun to descend.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3429">A: They were not.</sentence><sentence id="3430">Th-The British meddled a lot in -- since -- in fact, after the -- the War of Independence in 1821, they always thought of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> as a -- a part of their own <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3431">But, look, they -- they were primarily, interested as they should have been, in making sure that the Germans felt the brunt -- whether it was harassment, or actual, you know, telling action like blowing up <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3432">Because if nothing else, it kept units pinned down.</sentence><sentence id="3433">Now, we could not account for pinning, you know, crack divisions, but anything, you know, a help.</sentence><sentence id="3434">But there's no question that they were much more inclined to help the Zervas forces than -- but, eventually they saw the -- the light, and -- and it was almost like a kind of contract.</sentence><sentence id="3435">You take this action, blow up this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span>, and then the next two weeks, liberators would -- would uppen, so I -- we used to go and that's when I got my first shoes, after an air drop.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3499">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3501">A: -- it was -- maybe the ending of August, in two ways.</sentence><sentence id="3502">First of all, because our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> are more active -- but I have to tell you that I can remember it now in my mind's ear, because I had never heard all these months the sound of artillery.</sentence><sentence id="3503">You know, there's no artillery in partisan, but now you begin to hear, at a great distance, this dull thud, boom, boom, boom.</sentence><sentence id="3504">And at night, you know, it's not a heavy sound, it's not continuously [indecipherable] but it's there.</sentence><sentence id="3505">And at night you hear the same sound, but at the same time you see also the illumination in the <span class="DLF">horizon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3506">So you -- you -- you know somebody is firing, all right?</sentence><sentence id="3507">So essentially what's -- what's happened is by then the Germans are in very well organized retreat, they're abandoning <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3508">And of course, that's understood, and known, and so the partisans units physically are themselves beginning to move first to harass the rear of the departing Germans, but also to get low, because the lower parts now are themselves free.</sentence><sentence id="3509">So -- so it became a combination of news, combination of an action, a combination of hearing things, seeing things, and then beginning to assess the [indecipherable] because as soon as these things started, <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> wasn't going to stay in the rear where we were.</sentence><sentence id="3510">We be -- ousess began to descend to lower elevations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3521">Q: Are you also hearing about <span class="BUILDING">killing centers</span> in the east?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3523">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3525">Q: You don't hear anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3527">A: That -- at least -- I mean, i -- I cannot le -- I did not hear --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3529">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3531">A: -- at all.</sentence><sentence id="3532">Whether it was known, or whether it was known at the higher levels, at <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, I do -- I don't think so, because for example, I read the memoirs of Yugoslav partisans, some of them Bitola Jews, one of them, Zamilla Kolomonos, who was my fa -- my mother's maiden name, although no relation.</sentence><sentence id="3533">And they only find out at the end of the war, because coincidentally, Ilia Aaronburg, the Russian author, had been to a tour of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and who had been a -- obviously -- apparently to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, and who told the survivors, 67 out of 3500 Bitola Jews, that all were</sentence><sentence id="3535">4 exterminated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> with no survivors.</sentence><sentence id="3536">So I don't think that this kind of thing was - - was known until really I think se -- the Russians I think, because they wer -- they were the first that liberated parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3537">You know, my brother, when they had to abandon <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, was because of the approaching Russians.</sentence><sentence id="3538">So I think through that way, but it did not reach the partisans, certainly, and I think even -- even after we were liberated, we didn't understand the kind, as well as the magnitude, both in -- in -- in kind, and -- and -- and -- and size of the horror that had occurred.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3574">A: It's very hard not to -- to put myself in a kind of a frame at -- of mind that I had at that time, and try to speculate what it would have caused if -- if I had known.</sentence><sentence id="3575">Is -- I think, as I mentioned earlier -- perhaps we were off camera, I don't recall any more, that it's a lot - - both easier for me, and much more pleasant in my mind, to tell you what my mind was occupied with during -- especially the su -- the late summer months, as we begin to really more than hope now, we can see this being a tangible, reachable goal, to be liberated.</sentence><sentence id="3576">That more increasingly, my thoughts are, constantly are with the family, and of course the big unknown.</sentence><sentence id="3577">And I -- I -- I can still remember going on long walks in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and sitting on a rock, and looking at the horizon, beyond which you cannot see, because the next <span class="DLF">ridge</span> intervenes, and try to go mentally beyond that <span class="DLF">ridge</span>, and then I would see the family.</sentence><sentence id="3578">See, it -- I mean, picture them in my -- in my mind, but almost all the thought were, no matter how they started, were all how things are going to be, not how things they were, but how they are going to be, and I was -- it was this -- this feeling that with liberation there will be really I -- a -- a greater, brighter thing for everybody, and now the experience in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and so forth, had begun to ba -- I -- I grew up, almost overnight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3584">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3586">A: Thad -- I don't think I had another childish thought after I -- after the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Messenikolas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3587">So this is what was -- I was preoccupied with, that I -- that I would have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and how it will be with my mother, my father, and my brothers.</sentence><sentence id="3588">How I would able to guide them, and with all my experience.</sentence><sentence id="3589">So that was what was preoccupying -- you know, it would have been te-terrible, you know, to -- to -- to have had these kinds of things be disturbed by if we had learned what was actually happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3594">Q: Right, what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="3595">So, in many ways you were constructing a future --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3611">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3613">A: -- than retrospective looking.</sentence><sentence id="3614">And it's essential for me to have a -- an objective, so I would always formulate objectives that would be reached, that I can then act on.</sentence><sentence id="3615">And that's what was the primary -- and the -- the -- the closer this thing is -- is coming, the more eager I am to -- to do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3619">Q: So tell me about what liberation was like, how -- what led up to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3621">A: Very quickly, the thing that -- like many things like that happen very quickly, and that was -- towards the tail end of September, maybe beginning of October, we are issued orders that indeed we have to start descending down, and we physically begin to descend, and out of nowhere, I thought no one -- because I had -- in the month I had never seen that, a tiny little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Fiat automobile</span>, which was a -- a captured It-Italian army vehicle, which I think the Italians called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">topolino</span>, which means little mouse, which was -- it was smaller than a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">VW</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3622">And that's where -- there was a driver -- imagine that little thing, four people.</sentence><sentence id="3623">An-And I don't know why, here's the colonel sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger seat</span> in front, and in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rear seat</span> is the adjutant, who has the rank of a captain, and me.</sentence><sentence id="3624">But it's almost -- what -- as we are unload -- or taking the few files that we took with us, and maybe because I was helping, I just got in, and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="3625">So for hours we are driving down very rough <span class="DLF">roads</span> and things like this, stopping every so often, until finally, towards 10 or 11 o'clock at night, we stop someplace to -- for a relieve and -- and even to have a bite that we had carry with us.</sentence><sentence id="3626">And we slept on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, and we are already now in the plains of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thessaly</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3627">And the following morning as we are ready again to -- to proceed, the colonel turns the adjutant and says, "What's Nehama doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="3628">I mean, I've been with him for a whole day, talking and driving.</sentence><sentence id="3629">He just then realized that I was there, apparently.</sentence><sentence id="3630">Out.</sentence><sentence id="3631">So without any other thing, I'm ordered out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> in the middle of nowhere, and they left me.</sentence><sentence id="3632">I mean, I had my rifle, and a few personal belongings.</sentence><sentence id="3633">But -- but -- but soon, very soon, I -- I could hear even a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> coming, and it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that the -- the g -- the partisans had commandeered, and it was -- so they stopped, and I -- I got on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3647">Q: They picked you up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3649">A: And it took us to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="39.559111" long="21.763917">Trikala</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3650">So as I said, these things occur very, very fast.</sentence><sentence id="3651">And in fact when I was left, and then I boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, that's was the first time when I saw visual evidence of the German retreat, because on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, there were burned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span>, because they had been attacked, and I saw a considerable num -- number of dead German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="3652">Dead, in fact I still remember one of them on his back with a belly distended, because you know the corpse inflates after awhile, and stinks.</sentence><sentence id="3653">And these were visual, you know, again, evidence, th-that -- that they finally had left.</sentence><sentence id="3654">And so we reached</sentence><sentence id="3656">7 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="39.559111" long="21.763917">Trikala</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3657">And I don't know whether we encamped someplace.</sentence><sentence id="3658">But then, a couple of days later, we were ordered to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3659"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span> is a much larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and happens to be a -- also most central <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, because the <span class="DLF">railroad line</span> runs through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3660">So I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span>, and essentially I rejoined the regimental unit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3675">Q: And what constituted liberation, I mean, how -- how did it happen that somebody said it's over, the war is over?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3677">A Oh, nobody said that, I mean --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3683">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3685">A: So last night you're a slave, and the next your -- you're free.</sentence><sentence id="3686">It's happens, but the reason I'm say it happens with such rapidity is, we didn't -- we were not in constant touch, so we did not know if indeed we finally have seen the last of the rear guard of the retreating Germans, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3687"><span class="BUILDING">Units</span> are moving up, but there may be others coming behind them.</sentence><sentence id="3688">But so -- so all these thing you are doing, partly by your feel of the terrain, and what's happening in front of you, at the same time also, you're receiving orders which themselves are -- are delayed because again, the communications are not what we have today.</sentence><sentence id="3689">So it would take hours until you begin to get confirmation that yor -- you're f -- f - - eventually seeing the end of the German columns.</sentence><sentence id="3690">Let alone that some of our outlying units, on purpose were harassing the retreating Germans so to -- to speed them o-o-on their way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3697">Q: So is there a moment, let's say you -- the war -- the war is not over --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3723">A: -- but there, I -- Is -- talked to people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, in -- and as well as other parts, as from other units, and because by that time they knew, because they knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> was free, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pelaponsis</span> was free, and Lamia was free, and therefore they were free, and so that's - - that's when I knew that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3725">Q: Did you feel physical relief?</sentence><sentence id="3726">Did -- do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3729">A: I -- first of all, I -- I still remember that as we are coming down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, almost as - - as we are reaching the plains, not on purpose, I think accidentally I turned west, and I saw the retreating heights, where I spent the previous 13 months or so.</sentence><sentence id="3730">It's almost like visibly doing two things, thanking them for saving me, and two, you know, saying good- bye, that's why I've had since then, a tremendous love and affinity for <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3731">So that when -- when I finally got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="39.559111" long="21.763917">Trikala</span>, and I -- I -- and I was told that -- that then the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was free, there wasn't elation.</sentence><sentence id="3732">I -- I -- I don't believe that either mentally, or psycholo -- it was definitely not a letdown, but it was a kind of calm that now said, all right, now you have to cease worrying about survival from the standpoint of an enemy action, all right, and what di -- the German represented.</sentence><sentence id="3733">And soon you've got to be able to gather forces to do what I had been planning to do in the mou -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3734">So there was -- it was a feeling of -- a great deal of something, some weight lifted from the mind, that that <span class="NPIP">part</span> you don't have to worry.</sentence><sentence id="3735">But that didn't linger, and inst -- and it was s-supplanted by now, in the coming days, you're going to rejoin the family and you will then be able to pursue what you've been hoping to do.</sentence><sentence id="3736">It was more serenity than elation.</sentence><sentence id="3737">I mean elation was there, I mean we shouted a little bit, but it was -- it didn't last very long, there was much more -- I don't know whether I had a presentiment, I -- I -- obviously I -- I -- I didn't, but I -- it was -- I think others had the same thing, because when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span>, I met another Jewish boy, actually the son of the owner of the f -- company that my father worked for, who was the -- almost the last person I could imagine would have been there.</sentence><sentence id="3738">But he was there, and we had -- we talked for hours.</sentence><sentence id="3739">And I think we almost shared similar -- had similar reaction to the events.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3759">A: In -- that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3760">In fact, the day after I -- I saw Saby Camhi, whom I encountered in -- it was a little <span class="DLF">park</span> across the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were housed, and I had gone for a stroll.</sentence><sentence id="3761">And the following day I was maybe typing something, or writing something, and somebody come and told me that there is a lady at the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of the adjutant, which was next to the <span class="BUILDING">colonel's office</span>, asking for me.</sentence><sentence id="3762">First of all, who could have possibly be asking for me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span>?</sentence><sentence id="3763">So if -- i -- I went there, and she told me her name, Popi Stassnopoulos, and she told me that she is passing on her way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="39.559111" long="21.763917">Trikala</span>, and somehow my parents has learned that I was with this partisan unit.</sentence><sentence id="3764">Maybe Saby Shabetai or his parents ha -- because Saby still part of that.</sentence><sentence id="3765">And so she had been asked by my father to get in touch with me, bring me news of the family, and to urge me to go and see them as soon as</sentence><sentence id="3767">9 possible.</sentence><sentence id="3768">I had no thoughts of that yet, because I didn't know by what means I would -- I would leave to do that.</sentence><sentence id="3769">It didn't occur to me to do that -- first of all, it was really almost a -- a week or two after we -- no, less than that, and we -- we liberated.</sentence><sentence id="3770">She asked me if I had money to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3771">I -- I had no money, the -- the -- we did get paid in the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="3772">And she opened her purse and gave me -- which I thought it was a large -- rather a large denomination bills, or several of them, and told me that that would adequately cover a bus ticket.</sentence><sentence id="3773">And all the -- she was on her way to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to go, and I -- and I offered to -- to walk with her.</sentence><sentence id="3774">She says no, thanks a lot, but -- but she -- I asked if was news about my mother, but everybody wa -- were -- there were anxious moments, you know, during all the hiding, and so forth, but they're all very well, and extremely anxious to see you, and so don't tarry.</sentence><sentence id="3775">I have to -- to -- to let, I -- just a month before, in the middle of the summer, I had caught a cold, and I was offered a leave o -- a medical leave absence, but at the time I was offered, where was I going to go?</sentence><sentence id="3776">I didn't have relatives in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3777">But I had asked the doctor if he could ge -- keep it for me.</sentence><sentence id="3778">And so after I saw Mrs. Stassnopoulos, Popi, then I remembered this promise, so I went to him, and I said, "Is this still valid?"</sentence><sentence id="3779">Sure.</sentence><sentence id="3780">So immediately he signed the three week medical leave, which I then presented to the adjutant.</sentence><sentence id="3781">He said it was fine with him.</sentence><sentence id="3782">He says, "When do you want to leave?"</sentence><sentence id="3783">I said, "As soon as I can."</sentence><sentence id="3784">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">bus station</span>, and I booked a s -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> on a Sunday, which was November, I think November 19.</sentence><sentence id="3785">And that was the end of my stay with the partisans.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3833">A: But unlike when I came up from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, this time it was a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, so it could make good time, and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> in -- around three or four o'clock in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="3834">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> pre-war, as well as post war, I mean, I think all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> on Sunday, they are so quiet, it -- it -- it sounds almost de-deserted, especially in the commercial.</sentence><sentence id="3835">So I -- so we end up in the <span class="BUILDING">bus station</span>, and I got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and I call on the telephone.</sentence><sentence id="3836">Now actually, in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>, we share it with the people upstairs, the Shabetais, and so I think Mrs. Shabetai answered, and I said I just arrived, she says, "All</sentence><sentence id="3838">0 right, come on, come on." "</sentence><sentence id="3839">All right," I said, "I'm going to take a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3840">So I got ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span>, and eventually f -- it wasn't really -- it was Omonia, that square I mentioned to you earlier, where people will sit on the grates during the war.</sentence><sentence id="3841">It's a 10 minute ride at most.</sentence><sentence id="3842">And we got to the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but there's no one there.</sentence><sentence id="3843">I thought that by -- by then, by the time I made the telephone call, I would find my younger brothers there, eager to -- to see me atrive, there's no one.</sentence><sentence id="3844">And so I opened the main en -- <span class="DLF">entrance door</span>, and I go up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span>, where our -- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was, and I knocked on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opens, and who do I see?</sentence><sentence id="3845">Popi.</sentence><sentence id="3846">Mrs. Stassnopoulos.</sentence><sentence id="3847">She is the woman that had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa</span> to talk with me.</sentence><sentence id="3848">And she went like this, go upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="3849">I mean, I'm too dumbfounded to even ask her why.</sentence><sentence id="3850">So I trudge another -- another <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and I knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and Mrs. Shabetai opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and she embraced me, and she takes me by the hand into their <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, and there's my father.</sentence><sentence id="3851">And I still remember him, because that -- it was a -- a kind of a thing that he wore in winter, a flannel robe.</sentence><sentence id="3852">And he's sitting in a kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">deck chair</span>, because he -- he liked that kind of thing, with armrests.</sentence><sentence id="3853">Well, I went in and embraced him, and he kissed me, and -- and I see he is crying, and I say, ""Where is mother, and where is -- where is Sam, and Meko?"</sentence><sentence id="3854">Well he -

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3922">A: Slowly, yeah, he -- you know, I -- I -- I cannot -- now, and then, but of course more now, having children myself, I -- I began to feel, you know, that as soon as he emerged from hiding, he finds that he has no wife, and -- or children.</sentence><sentence id="3923">He doesn't know where I am, or where the rest of the family are, and -- and he has no answers, you know, nobody can -- can tell him.</sentence><sentence id="3924">I mean, in the case of my mother and my brothers, he has surmised that something horrible happened.</sentence><sentence id="3925">At least I had told him I was going to go up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, but whether I'm alive or not, he had no idea until the Shabetais return, which was not until, you know, two or three weeks later.</sentence><sentence id="3926">And only slowly he began to -- to tell me how it was.</sentence><sentence id="3927">I'm -- in fact I remember he told me that around September, he finally, in the last <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he was hiding in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, he got up, and he knew it was Yom Kippur, and he begun to pray.</sentence><sentence id="3928">And out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>, he saw another man in the -- in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> in the adjacent <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, who was also praying.</sentence><sentence id="3929">And that's when he realized it must be another Jew, and i-it wasn't in yet the liberation, not freedom yet, and when they got liberated, they -- they -- and he did -- he was another Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3930">So, I mean for my father, s -- being immobilized, first of all because of his -- of his leg, but even because of hiding, you know, when -- even people who were fully functional were -- couldn't roam around the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, you know, from fear of being seen by somebody, denounced, there were many of -- of this kind of people, in fact, you know, my family, as I know from my brother, were found by Rekanati, who was a -- a Jew, a Salonika Jew who worked for the Germans, and well, he was, you know, shot.</sentence><sentence id="3931">And so we were trying to pick up life again, out of the -- but no sooner are we doing that that the troubles start.</sentence><sentence id="3932">And at one point, because I didn't know what to do, I thought that I want to rejoin my unit, and my father went into hysterics, literal hysterics, which I thought a little bit ludicrous for a man of his age.</sentence><sentence id="3933">But now I can understand.</sentence><sentence id="3934">I mean, he is the only son that's left to him, and he's now talking about going and rejoining the unit, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3935">And it -- well, it wasn't so much his shouting that kept me there, but the doctor who gave me the leave, turn out to be staying at the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us.</sentence><sentence id="3936">So I went and I -- I said to him, "What shall I do?"</sentence><sentence id="3937">He said, "Don't go anyplace.</sentence><sentence id="3938">Stay here."</sentence><sentence id="3939">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3940">And that's what I did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3960">Q: How old was your father at this time, you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3973">Q: -- how long was it wh -- after you had seen your father that you knew it was [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3975">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="3976">May I fo -- spend a couple of minutes --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3979">Q: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3981">A: -- to mention what happened to me after, in December of "44, when finally the problem -- the political fighting was over.</sentence><sentence id="3982">Our neighbor, who w -- was liberated by German -- I mean -- German -- British -- British troops, and Greek police.</sentence><sentence id="3983">And, I mean everything had been closed, there would have been -- had been no food, other than what one had, you know, kept in before the trouble started.</sentence><sentence id="3984">So the following day, I went and stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> two blocks from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, waiting to get whatever, you know, was -- was available.</sentence><sentence id="3985">And five minutes later, after I started s-standing in <span class="DLF">line</span>, a number of police officers, gendarmerie come, and they're going down the <span class="DLF">line</span>, who is Isaac Nehama?</sentence><sentence id="3986">So, me.</sentence><sentence id="3987">Well they take me, and first they took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and I saw my father, there were other policemen and gendarme around, some of them in civilian clothes, some of them in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="3988">And my father is really half hysterical, half -- not hysterical, I mean vocally, but frightened, but at the some time, also resolute, because they are doing searches, and so forth, and he had a few gold sovereigns left on his person, and they found it.</sentence><sentence id="3989">He -- at -- for a moment he thought that they were going to grab it away, and there was the only thing that we had left to our name, so he started shouting, and screaming, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3990">Well they -- they didn't take the money, but they took me away, they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and they began to pummel me with the butt of the rifles, because they wanted me to reveal names of EAM/ELAS people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3991">I told them I hadn't been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> for over a year.</sentence><sentence id="3992">I was not a part of that before I left.</sentence><sentence id="3993">Yes, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ELAS</span>, but I went to survive, not to -- for political reasons, and certainly I did not know anyone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of that.</sentence><sentence id="3994">Well, I was beaten for -- for quite a time, but at the end I was put in a -- in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and taken to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> which ironically, in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, was the place where the Gestapo used to round up their prisoners in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3995">It was a -- an <span class="BUILDING">office building</span>, had the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, or the base for a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3996">And by the time I got there, it was dark, and I was -- a <span class="DLF">door</span> opened, and I was shoved, almost total darkness, except you could feel the smell and the noise of lots of other people.</sentence><sentence id="3997">In short, they had been rounding up people, and the following day they put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, they took us to a -- a c -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mini camp</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span> with barbed wire, near the shore, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glifada</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, a s -- beautiful <span class="BUILDING">spa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3998">And I -- I was kept there for a -- a day and a half, and then we were taken, and put on to Pireas on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3999">We didn't know where we were going, and after a traverse of I think three or four days and nights, then also it happens in darkness we will disembark.</sentence><sentence id="4000">And we found ourselves in -- in the middle of a <span class="DLF">desert</span>, at least it looked like a <span class="DLF">desert</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4001">Now subsequently I learned it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4002">Well, what had happened, the British then had taken all these things as prisoners, because the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ELAS</span> had taken some British soldiers as -- as prisoners, so it was kept as a kind of bargaining chip.</sentence><sentence id="4003">Well, fortunately, in the meantime, my father, through frantic efforts, and a cousin of his, knew</sentence><sentence id="4005">3 the Europe Times correspondent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, who knew Damaskinos, the archbishop, who had become regent by that time, and told him about the fate of this Jewish boy who goes to save himself, loses most of his family, and -- and now he's a -- a prisoner of the British.</sentence><sentence id="4006">Because two days after I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugia</span>, then once a day some British soldier will come with a clipboard and mention names.</sentence><sentence id="4007">And somebody said to me, "Your name has been called."</sentence><sentence id="4008">So effectively, the word had come down, and I was repatriated.</sentence><sentence id="4009">So I think this needs to -- to have a nice book end for my partisan --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4041">Q: And -- and this lasted for a week?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4043">A F-F-For a -- from the time that I was picked up, till the time I returned was, I think, 15 days.</sentence><sentence id="4044">And I came back, I think, the seventh or eighth of January of "45.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4047">Q: Now, you were --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4049">A: I think you were asking me earlier about when Sam returned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4051">Q: No, but let me ask you something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4053">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4055">Q: Was this the first time in your life that you were beaten?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4057">A: Yes, by supposedly our allies.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4059">Q: [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4061">A: Well, look I can understand they -- they -- you know, they -- what they were trying to do, I -- I wasn't beaten by the British themselves, I was beaten by the Greek gendarmerie, who were, of course, doing the beating of -- of the -- I think the British, wa -- once I got to the <span class="BUILDING">detention place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> itself, and to [indecipherable], once we came under English army control, people not beaten.</sentence><sentence id="4062">If anything else we were well treated.</sentence><sentence id="4063">I mean, food was there plentiful.</sentence><sentence id="4064">In <span class="COUNTRY">Libya</span> one day, a man came, an English, with a English uniform, and I saw in his shoulder a patch that said <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4065">I took a chance, and I addressed him in Hebrew, the only phrase that I -- I knew, do you speak Hebrew?</sentence><sentence id="4066">And he says, "Are you," -- I didn't know how to -- I didn't know any more Hebrew other than that, but I told him my name.</sentence><sentence id="4067">Then he said, ""Okay, come in the evening."</sentence><sentence id="4068">Then in the evening he brought me a couple of bars of chocolate.</sentence><sentence id="4069">Tha -- of course, it wasn't really in his power to let me out.</sentence><sentence id="4070">But I was let out in a few days anyhow.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4081">Q: Were you very hurt when they -- when they hit you, I mean you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4083">A: I mean, I don't know if they did it on purpose, they really pummeled me in the upper body and the legs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4085">Q: With the butt of a rifle?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4091">A: Yes, and at -- at one point, the man had this -- th -- even a bayonet fixed, and he went like this, I'm -- I'm sure that -- and because I think he -- it pierced my overcoat, that famous blue overcoat, which I mentioned to you, I had -- I had still saved it from the partisan days, and had rit -- brought -- brought back, but it was just a -- a -- a -- a savage beating.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4093">Q: Did that do something to you, as a human being, did that --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4095">A Of course, I -- well, first of all, I was -- I was really, for one thing, taken aback that -- that such savagery was possible, and especially for something that w -- I had not done, or for - - I could not fulfill a request which in good consc -- I wasn't hiding anything.</sentence><sentence id="4096">It wasn't as if they were asking me the name of my unit, or where are they?</sentence><sentence id="4097">I would have told them.</sentence><sentence id="4098">There was nothing s-secret about that.</sentence><sentence id="4099">But they -- they were -- and I can see that this was not done at the request of the British, but it was simply on their own initiative.</sentence><sentence id="4100">It was that horrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="4101"><span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, unfortunately, is the only <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where the resistance, which in spite of all of this horrible political infighting, at least did something to shore up the morale of the people, inflict losses on the Germans and the Italian.</sentence><sentence id="4102">It was never officially recognized until about 10 years ago, when finally Papandreaou, the minister who was now the prime minister is dead, rammed a law through one of the two <span class="BUILDING">Houses of Parliament</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4103">He didn't even clear both of them.</sentence><sentence id="4104">And this is the tragedy, the pity of Greek political life and affairs, that even after 50 or more years, they are not even willing to say bygones be bygones, at least recognize a contribution that was made, of substantial dimensions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4115">Q: Okay, Sam.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4117">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="4118">Well, I then resumed my life in the sense that I began to prepare myself.</sentence><sentence id="4119">Now it's beginning of the year of "45, for taking the entrance examinations at the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> in -- in sep --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4123">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="4124">The same <span class="NPIP">place</span> you were going to go to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4127">A: In September, right.</sentence><sentence id="4128">But it means preparation.</sentence><sentence id="4129">Well, of course the war -- war is still raging in Europe, I mean, still going on, and finally it ends at the end of April of 45, and soon thereafter, the stories first trickle, then becomes a torrent, both in the newspaper stories, as well as the newsreels, to see the emaciated, things in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span>, the piles of corpses, and all this horror.</sentence><sentence id="4130">Well, what can one do but, you know, without any trace of where our loved ones are.</sentence><sentence id="4131">And it was not until I think beginning of August, of "45, that first on the radio -- at the time of news, they didn't have the things as bulletins, at the time of news, it would be an extended time that they took to recite names, because as news be-began to trickle down, and come down from Europe of prisoners from the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, some -- in some cases the Greeks themselves, political prisoners who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, then there was also news from contingents of Greeks that had gone, some of them forcibly, some of them voluntarily, to work in <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4132">But they got, of course also co -- caught by the fighting of the war.</sentence><sentence id="4133">Some of them never returned, and so they also had to be listed.</sentence><sentence id="4134">And then one day in the</sentence><sentence id="4136">5 beginning of August of "45, a neighbor called me and told me that she heard my brother's name mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="4137">But because I -- I didn't wa -- I didn't know whether she had heard correctly, whether she made a mistake, whether the -- the possibility of there being another person of the same name.</sentence><sentence id="4138">I didn't tell my father, and I immediately came down, it was very early in the morning, and I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> -- the nearest <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4139">I went to the -- and I -- and I told them what I wanted, and they had the list that it was going to appear in the afternoon paper, and then I saw Sam Nehama, comma, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4140">So I was confident enough because I knew that they -- we are the only Nehamas in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, so I then brought this thing with me, and show it to my father.</sentence><sentence id="4141">And now of course, there is no way, I mean, I asked at the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper office</span> how can one get in touch, because usually this information came via UNRRA, who was the relief organization that shepherded all these DPs, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4142">But there was nothing tangible, but while we are fretting, I mean, when we gonna hear, and when is he gonna come, the following day he called on the phone.</sentence><sentence id="4143">Now, on the phone he told us that he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4144">So, I thought meant that he was going to take the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span>, which takes about a day to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4145">And then -- so we thought that it was going to be a few days more.</sentence><sentence id="4146">And then, about half an hour later, the phone rang again, I remember it was at the neighbors, and I had to run upstairs, and it was Sam again, he says, "I -- I -- I called you from Corling.</sentence><sentence id="4147">I didn't want to break the news so suddenly upon you that I'm here, I'm not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>, I'm already in <span class="REGION">Greek territory</span>, I'm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolif</span>, which is an hour and a half.</sentence><sentence id="4148">So, I told my father, Sam is here, he couldn't believe it, of course he couldn't come -- I -- and ran to the railr -- <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4149">He came off, you know, was whole hundreds, literally, of people retur -- returning from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and Europe, and he had on short corduroy, brown corduroy pants, in the manner of lederhosen, you know, which I'm sure he must have gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from one agency or the other.</sentence><sentence id="4150">And of -- of course, first of all the -- what impressed me was his size, it was -- he was a grown man, and -- and certainly he was not thin, he looked rather -- very, very healthy and well fed.</sentence><sentence id="4151">And --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4179">Q: And how old is he now?</sentence><sentence id="4180">You were nine -- you were --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4183">A: At -- at -- at the moment we are talking about our reunion --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4185">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4187">A: Okay, he was 15 years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4189">Q: And he's a grown man [indecipherable] because of what he [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4191">A: No, no, he's -- he still, you know, has a youthful face.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4193">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4195">A: But he has the stature of a grown man, he was not the little, short boy that I had left before.</sentence><sentence id="4196">And let alone that in my mind's eye, having seen the newsreels, and read the stories, and when I knew that he was also liberated, you know, I thought I was going to see a broken individual, not -- if not ema-emaciated, or as -- a skeleton with skin, but</sentence><sentence id="4198">6 certainly even with premature gray hair.</sentence><sentence id="4199">Fortunately none of that had touched Sam, which I'm very, very happy for him.</sentence><sentence id="4200">I think in contrast, I think I had been much more affected by the -- the war, though I did not see the -- the horrors that he did, but by the separation, because I was at an -- at an age where I could begin to -- to think about things like this, and in -- in -- internalize them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4209">Q: It's interesting, because one would assume, theoretically --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4211">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4213">Q: -- that a young boy who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> would be more affected than the boy who was in the resistance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4215">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4217">Q: Yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4219">A: Originally, when I was told that you were interested in interviewing me, I told Sharon Mueller that I have nothing to say, compared to what Sam went through.</sentence><sentence id="4220">But Sharon is a wise lady, and she said, "The invitation is not proportional to the travail that one has undergone, with what one has to say."</sentence><sentence id="4221">So that persuaded me to come and -- and talk with you.</sentence><sentence id="4222">But I always think that the -- compared to what he saw, and what he went through, mine really paled [indecipherable] insignificance, except that things that -- the way they affected me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4227">Q: Affected you, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4229">A: I would -- perhaps I would have felt -- and I've had the same kind of -- of -- even if I was in hiding, because I was at a -- you know, even two or three years made a difference, and maybe my own inclination [indecipherable] was to -- to think about these things, and I thought a lot about them.</sentence><sentence id="4230">And the -- the -- the pain of not finding them, seeing them in newsreels what had gone on, and seeing the enormity of these things, all of those things then combined to very quickly |-leave, at least in me, what I perceive -- I cannot obviously speak for Sam and what is deep in his mind, but I had a -- a much more -- I felt it, I think more than he did.</sentence><sentence id="4231">That's -- I -- I think that I did, I'm -- I'm not sure that that's true, objectively.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4235">Q: But you also, in terms of being with the partisans, and maybe this makes a difference, not only were you older, but you had time to think about it, you had time to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4237">A: Yes, although in both cases, there was always the question of survival.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4239">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4409">A: -- I took the entrance examinations, and I was accepted.</sentence><sentence id="4410">But almost simultaneously, I was informed -- because I did not know that until after it happened, that my father, all this time after the liberation, even -- even before Sam returned, was working behind the scenes -- at least he did not tell me, that's what I mean by behind the scenes, to, through his contacts in -- with the B'nai Brith, to see what he could do to assure my education.</sentence><sentence id="4411">And so finally things have progressed far enough, I guess from the other end, from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, that he had to tell me.</sentence><sentence id="4412">And my first reaction was, I have to confess, a little bit negative because -- not so much the idea of going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to study, but that suddenly my future had been already prepared for me.</sentence><sentence id="4413">When I was a child, to be an</sentence><sentence id="4415">0 engineer is fine, and I grew to like it, but later on, you know, I -- I -- I'm now an adult, I can -- I ca -- have to decide for myself.</sentence><sentence id="4416">But that only lasted for a few hours, or a few days, and so I attended classes at the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic</span> only for, essentially the first semester, because then everything -- I had to get to ready to come <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4417">Among other things to get ready is getting the visas and passports, but even more than that was transportation.</sentence><sentence id="4418">Remember, it was still a year after the war, and we had to wait for the next available <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with a opening that was traveling the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and that -- the first opening was in October of "46.</sentence><sentence id="4419">And that's when I --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4441">A: I'm -- I'm -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're -- you're kind, because I thought you would continue, you would carry it one more step and say how did I dare then leave him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4443">Q: Well, I might have gone there, so it's good that you said that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4445">A: Well, there is no question my -- my father, I mean, he wa -- he used to tell me, I remember, even when I was already in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, if I would ask him for some money to do so something like, I don't know, go to a movie, or something -- or -- or go buy something, he would say to me, "Look, I don't have the money to give you for that purpose.</sentence><sentence id="4446">But if you were to ask me that you want to go buy a book, even if I don't have the money, I will tell you what I will do.</sentence><sentence id="4447">I will not smoke for a week to save from smoking, so -- so -- anything that has to do with education, I, you know, I'Il do, or that," - - so it's not surprising to me, and I -- and I know in some respects, because I learned these things subsequently, my -- my f-father would say things that were not true, fibs, lies, but they were lies in -- for good purposes.</sentence><sentence id="4448">But even before he worked this thing with -- through the B'nai Brith for a scholarship for me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I know he wrote a letter to Churchill saying -- which was a bit of an exaggeration, that he, at the risk of his life had hidden a British soldier who had to go into hiding -- because a British contingent had come to help the Greeks when we were fighting the Italians.</sentence><sentence id="4449">And then, of course, in deg41.</sentence><sentence id="4450">It was partly true.</sentence><sentence id="4451">There was a man who was in the British army that happened to be f -- his parents from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monastir</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4452">And he came to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, you know, for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pessach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4453">And so we invited him, and he joined us for [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="4454">That's what happened, that's true.</sentence><sentence id="4455">But he was not really hiding.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4467">Q: Hiding.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4469">A: And so -- so he -- he -- in other words, my father would do anything, even embellish the truth, or stretch it, to assure that I had the proper education.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4478">Q: And he really thought you couldn't get it in --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4482">Q: It wasn't that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4484">A: No, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="4485">No, that -- that -- that -- that -- on the other hand, getting into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> -- because for a long time, in ac -- in a certain ways my father was naive.</sentence><sentence id="4486">When I was growing up, I was going to be a textile engineer.</sentence><sentence id="4487">Well why?</sentence><sentence id="4488">I mean, dit -- what does he know about textiles, other than some son of some business assoc -- associate had gone and studied textile engineering in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yaszh</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, which a-apparently had a well- known <span class="BUILDING">textile engineering school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4489">So I was being prepared fully for engineering, but also for textile engineer.</sentence><sentence id="4490">Of course I -- all of that got changed, you know, when I decided to be an electrical engineer, and [indecipherable] textiles.</sentence><sentence id="4491">But h -- he understood this much, that opportunities in Europe, education opportunities, let alone the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, which was a mirage, you know, sort of not only far away physically, but so distant emotionally.</sentence><sentence id="4492">So he would do anything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4502">Q: So r -- let me then ask you the more difficult question.</sentence><sentence id="4503">How did you dare leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4506">A: Well, how I dare leave, first of all I was i -- after awhile inebriated by the thought that I was going to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4507">Second, Sam had returned, so I knew my father was not alone.</sentence><sentence id="4508">Third, I was joined by a cousin, whose -- whose father was my father's cousin.</sentence><sentence id="4509">I -- I -- with a young man, Jeff Levi -- lev -- Levis was his name, we came together on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4510">He went to <span class="REGION">Iowa</span>, I went to <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4511">We related from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>, the maternal and the <span class="REGION">paternal side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4512">So, and he was an only child.</sentence><sentence id="4513">And therefore, I -- putting all these things together, there were no limits to that what parents would not do to further -- after all, I was going to study.</sentence><sentence id="4514">It didn't necessarily mean that I was going to go there forever.</sentence><sentence id="4515">I could have easily, in normal times, be sent to study in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span>, which has another textile engineering sch -- <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4516">So there were -- th -- there were no thoughts -- now, if -- if Sam had not returned, I can, as they say in Greek, I could put my hand on flames and swear that my father would have done the same thing, and he would have pushed me, and encouraged me, and really shoved me, because he -- he felt the -- the value of -- of education.</sentence><sentence id="4517">And I did it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4678">A: The -- the -- the context is that t -- two aspects about it.</sentence><sentence id="4679">One, that it's definitely it was a s -- extremely significant period in my life, and I think to a large extent, a considerable extent, also forming.</sentence><sentence id="4680">You know, it was the kind of a maybe -- I don't want to use the word crucible.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4712">A: No, I'd like to thank you, almost in the same -- for the same reasons that Sam says the same thing to his own interviewer, because the other reason, other than Sharon's very wise statement persuading me to do that, is that it leaves something for either my descendents, number one, as well as perhaps people in the future, who might be interested about this particular period.</sentence><sentence id="4713">And this I'm saying now, following a year and a half of work as a volunteer for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and doing this thing for the Bitola Jews, I have lived with, essentially almost 2000 faces of people who are all dead, and who -- whose names then I had to type it into a database, and who become alive, and then reading books, and talking about that.</sentence><sentence id="4714">So, I want to thank you for then doing that, because it leaves something which might be of some small value or use to some interested historian, or -- or person in the future.</sentence></p></dialogue>
