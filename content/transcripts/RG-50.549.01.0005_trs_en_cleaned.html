<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: You say that you grew up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and certainly, when your life was disrupted, you were about five I believe -- and then, you were about ten I believe -- and correct me if I'm wrong, when the last <span class="NPIP">place</span> you were was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="17">How did you grow up, what happened to you, who was the little boy when your life was disrupted, and who was that boy or boy adult when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were liberated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: Well, we, of course, were already on the run from 1939 on, and I remember very little from that period.</sentence><sentence id="21">I was born in 1934, so in "39 I was five years old.</sentence><sentence id="22">I was a scared little boy, that's all I remember.</sentence><sentence id="23">I remember our crossing the <span class="DLF">border</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and worrying that something would happen to my father and knowing my father and mother were very worried about what was going to happen; being fascinated by some of the new languages I heard -- Yiddish for the</sentence><sentence id="25">Thomas Buergenthal 4 November 28, 1995 Page 4 first time in my life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">Really, I didn't start sort of facing the reality of the war and what it meant, and sort of the reality of trying to survive, until probably 1943, because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> still, when we survived the first in 1942, when they, when they dissolved the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and sent most of the people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">I was still very much sort of part -- I would do what my parents wanted me to do and I would be the child that did what had to be done.</sentence><sentence id="42">And in "43 I sort of began to be aware that I had to -- even though I was still with my parents -- that I had to do certain things on my own in order to survive.</sentence><sentence id="43">And then, of course, when I was left --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Such as?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Such as, well, for example, when we were in 1943, we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>, and when that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was dissolved, the initial thing was that I had to hide in order not to be seen by the Gestapo because they were taking all of the children away.</sentence><sentence id="51">And then what happened, I actually survived this: they saw me of course, we were all lined up on one of these <span class="DLF">fields</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span>, and they start pulling me, and my father pulled me back.</sentence><sentence id="52">And then my father took me to the chief of the Gestapo, who was standing in front of everybody, and said to him, "This is my son."</sentence><sentence id="53">And this man looked at me, and I said to him, in German, "I can work."</sentence><sentence id="54">And, you know, it just came out of me.</sentence><sentence id="55">How do you say it in German? "</sentence><sentence id="56">Ich kann arbeiten"?</sentence><sentence id="57">And his response in German</sentence><sentence id="59">Thomas Buergenthal 5 November 28, 1995 Page 5 was "Na, das wollen wir mal sehen" -- "Let's see" -- and he let me live.</sentence><sentence id="60">This was -- I was the only one of the children from that -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span> who survived that way.</sentence><sentence id="61">There were two others who hid in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they took all of the children.</sentence><sentence id="62">And that was sort of the beginning of my awakening to the fact that I was going to have to save my own life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: And in that case, instead of running away or trying not to be noticed, you went right into the belly of the beast.</sentence><sentence id="81">You went right face-to-face with the danger.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, that, in part, that was really my father's doing, who, who, who had sort of analyzed the Germans and knew that you had to often confront them in certain ways and that they had great, sort of, difficulty with their own propaganda and with the reality.</sentence><sentence id="85">Here was a kid who spoke German the way their own children spoke German, who didn't look as Jewish as they perceived Jews to look from Der Stiirmer, which was the German sort of propaganda newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="86">And suddenly to have this kid talk to them, it personalized it.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I think this was my father's -- he sort of contributed to my doing what I did.</sentence><sentence id="88">He must have said himself, "You have to."</sentence><sentence id="89">Maybe he -- I don't remember, maybe he said, "You have to tell them you can work."</sentence><sentence id="90">It could well be, but it worked.</sentence><sentence id="91">And after that, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> again, the first time, when I worked for the Kapo that, the Kapo was somebody my father had known before, because it was a man who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span> and was shipped out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> two years before we did.</sentence><sentence id="92">So, by the</sentence><sentence id="94">Thomas Buergenthal 6 November 28, 1995 Page 6 time we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, he was a Kapo -- quite a brutal one.</sentence><sentence id="95">But he treated his friends well, and he sort of took me in.</sentence><sentence id="96">It was a terrible sort of society, to live.</sentence><sentence id="97">But that helped.</sentence><sentence id="98">I also -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.873" long="20.632">Kielce</span> still, I worked as an errand boy for the man who ran that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>, and I must -- I don't know how that came about.</sentence><sentence id="99">But what I remember -- I don't know whether I told it on tape, I probably did -- I used to sit outside his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and he would listen to the radio and I would listen, and would sort of report to my parents on the news because we had no news, of course.</sentence><sentence id="100">So I became the one who tried to memorize all the news that I heard on the German radio, and report it to my father and mother and I suppose through them, to the other people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="101">I even reported on the fact that Mussolini had been captured and they didn't believe me -- of course they thought this kid is imagining things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: At that point, a young boy, you might have felt angry or even intense hatred for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="125">What was it like to work for one, one-on-one as an errand boy, and how did you cope with that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: You know, I didn't have to cope at all, that's the curious thing.</sentence><sentence id="129">He was a very, he was very nice to me.</sentence><sentence id="130">He never mistreated me.</sentence><sentence id="131">But he was quite brutal.</sentence><sentence id="132">He would beat people if he saw them not working.</sentence><sentence id="133">And so I figured out he would do that and so when he made his inspection tours, I would just really sort of run ahead and make certain motions.</sentence><sentence id="134">He had a hat with a feather and I would motion to people that the feather was coming so everybody started to work, so -- because I had seen him beat</sentence><sentence id="136">Thomas Buergenthal 7 November 28, 1995 Page 7 a lot of people if he caught them not working.</sentence><sentence id="137">But he wasn't, he wasn't, never abused me, never mistreated me.</sentence><sentence id="138">That's strange, you know, as a child I remember he used to have a visit from some officer of the SS who would arrive with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, and he would hand me the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and put it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle stand</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">And believe it or not, in all this environment in which we lived, I learned to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> with this SS man's bicycle.</sentence><sentence id="140">You know, a child is a child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: And you weren't afraid to do that that they might come out of the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> and see you playing with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: I must say, I thought about it, but then I figured when he told me to take it and as long as I didn't break it, I was all right.</sentence><sentence id="161">You know, the fear factor was not -- the fear factor was one of survival and not of sort of what could happen in between for doing this or doing that.</sentence><sentence id="162">Because I really, when I think back, I was not afraid and not because I'm not a person who's not afraid, but because it just didn't seem there was any reason to be afraid.</sentence><sentence id="163">There were many reasons in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to be afraid, but not to these sort of episodes.</sentence><sentence id="164">I was describing to my class -- they asked me the other day -- I remember breaking in with a friend of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of the SS and stealing milk, which was the first milk I had drunk, we had a cup of milk in two years.</sentence><sentence id="165">And if we had been caught we would have been beaten to death, but it sort of: there was the milk and we had to drink it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Were you ever afraid that you yourself would just arbitrarily get beaten, or perhaps</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="177"><span class="BUILDING">Thomas Buergenthal 8</span></sentence></p><p><sentence id="178">November 28, 1995</sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">Page 8</sentence></p><p><sentence id="180">be chosen to go into the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>?</sentence><sentence id="181">After all, you saw this happen often, every day.</sentence><sentence id="182">Did you imagine that happening to you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Well, first of all, beaten.</sentence><sentence id="184">You know, one got beaten because one pushed in the <span class="DLF">food line</span>, and then they swung the stick and I was beaten on my back, but nothing really very serious.</sentence><sentence id="185">No, the fact that one thought, that I thought I would die in there, that was a reality.</sentence><sentence id="186">And it happened quite a number of times, where the risk existed and I knew exactly what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="187">As a matter of fact, I was in situations where I thought I was finished, there was no way out.</sentence><sentence id="188">No, that fear, and that fear was tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="189">Until, you know, once I hit a moment when I realized there was nothing more to do, I couldn't escape anymore, and suddenly a tremendous peace came over me, I thought I was going to die.</sentence><sentence id="190">I had done everything possible not to get caught and there was no escape, and I sort of made peace with myself and with death at that point.</sentence><sentence id="191">But it didn't last very long.</sentence><sentence id="192">You know, the survival instinct comes right back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Let's move on now to the point at liberation, and if you can, just situate us.</sentence><sentence id="204">Where were you, how old were you, and what kind of physical state were you in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: I was at liberation, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> which is about 20 kilometers outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And by that time I had survived the death march but lost -- I had frostbite, and was operated actually, in an <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">They had sort of a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> set up, because it was one of these model camps, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">demonstration camps</span>, where they would keep people and could show that they were</sentence><sentence id="211">Thomas Buergenthal 9 November 28, 1995 Page 9 actually treating people well, but at the same time would execute people and do everything else.</sentence><sentence id="212">But it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">model camp</span>, and I was there.</sentence><sentence id="213">I had two toes amputated.</sentence><sentence id="214">And then when the war was coming to a close, the Germans decided to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="215">But those of us who couldn't really walk very much, and some people were much sicker than I, we were left behind in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">And the assumption was that they were going to come and shoot all of us; this was sort of, we all expected that was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="217">I was able to move.</sentence><sentence id="218">I had a crutch or a cane or something, so I think I was operated maybe three weeks before, or so.</sentence><sentence id="219">It was strange, after the evacuation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, it was very strange but it was very quiet.</sentence><sentence id="220">And then you begin to hear artillery fire coming closer.</sentence><sentence id="221">And I think I went to sleep, evacuation must have been the day before.</sentence><sentence id="222">The next morning I got up and it was very, very quiet except for the shooting coming closer.</sentence><sentence id="223">I crawled out, went out and looked up and saw in the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, over the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> -- they always had a machine gun mounted with SS guards sitting on, and there was nobody there, the machine gun was empty.</sentence><sentence id="224">I came back and told people.</sentence><sentence id="225">Of course, nobody believed that this was happening.</sentence><sentence id="226">And then we just waited and the shooting came closer.</sentence><sentence id="227">Then we began hearing small arms fire and suddenly -- so I think it was in the early afternoon -- we heard the gong, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had a big bell in the middle of this <span class="DLF">field</span>, and a Russian soldier had driven in with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and was ringing the bell saying, "You're free."</sentence><sentence id="230">Thomas Buergenthal 10 November 28, 1995 Page 10</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: In what <span class="NPIP">language</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="265">It must have been in Russian, but Russian and Polish is relatively close.</sentence><sentence id="266">And the instructions were that we were free, we could go anyplace we wanted except not this way because that's where the Germans still were, so you go the other way.</sentence><sentence id="267">And the first thing that we did was to storm the <span class="NPIP">place</span> with the SS kept their supplies.</sentence><sentence id="268">And people, of course, these were all people who were quite sick and everybody dragged themselves to the <span class="BUILDING">supply place</span> and people began to eat.</sentence><sentence id="269">It was very lucky for me that I couldn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="270">I remember finding a pickle.</sentence><sentence id="271">There was bread and everything else and all I could eat was a pickle.</sentence><sentence id="272">It probably saved my life because a lot of people ate and not having eaten for a long time, just gorged themselves and got quite sick and many of them died.</sentence><sentence id="273">I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="274">I just couldn't swallow.</sentence><sentence id="275">And then sort of a day later, there was a young Pole, must have been in his early 20s and I--we -- decided we were going to leave.</sentence><sentence id="276">So we just went out on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and started moving, then we were joined by some other people, there were some women, also from -- I don't know where they came, but Polish women.</sentence><sentence id="277">And we -- the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> -- this was the city of where the camp is, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>, is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienberg</span>, and we must have been in the area of that, moving away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">The <span class="BUILDING">German houses</span> were standing empty because the Germans had fled, and often times the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were still set, dirty dishes were sitting, and you could just occupy a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we just moved from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to the other, until these Polish soldiers</sentence><sentence id="280">Thomas Buergenthal 11 November 28, 1995 Page 11 came and started talking, they talked to the women, of course.</sentence><sentence id="281">And then they saw me and they said, "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="282">I said that I didn't know where I was going, I was trying to find my parents.</sentence><sentence id="283">And they said, "Well where they would be?"</sentence><sentence id="284">And I said, "They would probably be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>," and so they took me with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Let's go back a couple steps.</sentence><sentence id="311">I'm curious about what else the Russian said, what was that scene, like when the Russian soldier gonged the bell.</sentence><sentence id="312">Did people come out and stand around, then did you guys hug each other?</sentence><sentence id="313">Was there a feeling that you were really liberated at that point, or did that come a little bit later?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: You know when I see pictures of people who are liberated by American troops, by British troops, they were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="319">We were none of these scenes as far as I remember.</sentence><sentence id="320">The Russians just told us, "You can go."</sentence><sentence id="321">There was no effort made to help us in any way, to provide any medical services, and there was no hugging.</sentence><sentence id="322">I don't remember, I mean we felt a great sense of relief because we expected to be shot, but none of that -- it was probably too, in retrospect, it was almost too much.</sentence><sentence id="323">It was hard to believe that we were free after all this and that nothing had happened to us.</sentence><sentence id="324">No, I don't remember these scenes of liberation.</sentence><sentence id="325">I really don't remember even realizing that I was liberated until the war was over because everybody started shooting into the <span class="DLF">air</span>, and it came, sort of, on my birthday.</sentence><sentence id="326">But I didn't have any sense of the tremendous joy that other people must have experienced.</sentence><sentence id="327">I was alone in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="328">I think that if my parents had been there it would have been different.</sentence><sentence id="331">Thomas Buergenthal 12 November 28, 1995 Page 12</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: And when you had hooked up with the young Polish boy and you were moving around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span>, did you feel frightened that Germans could come up and recapture you, perhaps?</sentence><sentence id="350">What was the mood like, or were you just sitting back with your feet up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and having a nice time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="353">A: Well, where we were afraid, of course, was when we were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we didn't know what happened to the Germans, whether they would come back and whether it was really true that they had left.</sentence><sentence id="354">But once we were out, I don't remember worrying about it.</sentence><sentence id="355">It seemed that it was over, and the fact that the Germans had just disappeared without a trace, the soldiers, must have had that impact.</sentence><sentence id="356">But I just don't remember that maybe as a child you're liberated, you're free.</sentence><sentence id="357">No, I had no sense that there was any danger from the Germans at that point.</sentence><sentence id="358">Of course, I then ended up, when I was a mascot, in the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and that was quite -- there was a really almost hand-to-hand combat and there it was quite dangerous.</sentence></p></dialogue>

I remember there were negotiations going on for the surrender of the Germans, and at one point it looked there was some danger because there was a whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> full of Germans as we were moving back and our company was quite exposed but the Germans wanted to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="614">And these negotiations went on all night and I slept through the whole thing and when I woke up in the morning, most of the German officers had merely negotiated in order to be able to escape.</sentence><sentence id="615">That's also I remember from that episode.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="630">Q: Did you talk at all about what you had just went through or did you plunge yourself into this new life?</sentence><sentence id="631">Did anyone say, "What was it like for you to be in one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="632">Was anybody talking to you about that at that point or did you feel a need, a desire to talk about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="636">A: No, actually I don't think anybody was talking about it because, of course, these</sentence><sentence id="638">Thomas Buergenthal 21 November 28, 1995 Page 21 people had come out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian concentration camp</span>, they had gone through the entire war, they knew what it was all about.</sentence><sentence id="639">If people talked about anything it would be always to say, "Where are you from?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="662">Q: Actually something you just said raises a question.</sentence><sentence id="663">Did you feel Jewish and if so, how so?</sentence><sentence id="664">I mean, had you been able to in any way affirm your identity as a Jew in this period or were you really too little to have been given that by your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="668">A: No, I felt very much that I was Jewish but it's strange, my family was not a religious family at all.</sentence><sentence id="669">I had no religious education at all.</sentence><sentence id="670">Religion and Judaism became part of survival for me and I think that was part of what my father, my family brought me up.</sentence><sentence id="671">The Germans wanted to kill us because we were Jews and we were going to win this battle with them as Jews and we were going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="672">And so the Judaism that</sentence><sentence id="674">Thomas Buergenthal 22 November 28, 1995 Page 22 was instilled in me was the Judaism that said that we were going to win over the Germans, we're not going to let them kill us and we were going to be proud of the fact that we can survive.</sentence><sentence id="675">I remember my father always saying, "We are going to be alive long after they are six feet under."</sentence><sentence id="676">So in that sense, Judaism, the fact that we were different, was part of the thing that helped us live.</sentence><sentence id="677">That was very strongly instilled in me.</sentence><sentence id="678">But never religious, never from a religious point of view.</sentence><sentence id="679">But my father was very much, very strong as a believer the fact that he was a Jew, but not a religious Jew at all, neither was my mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1276">Q: So then your mother took you <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1277">Had you ever been to where she was living before?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1280">A: No, because actually, even though my grandparent's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> still stood, my grandparent's were forced to sell it and my mother lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and life suddenly became normal after all of those years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1282">Q: And, in a sense, it hadn't been that long since you hadn't seen your mother but in another sense you had become essentially a man who figured out how to make his way in the middle of this war.</sentence><sentence id="1283">How did she react to that?</sentence><sentence id="1284">You must have been very independent by that point, not her little boy anymore.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1288">A: I don't know whether that's true.</sentence><sentence id="1289">I reverted to being her little boy in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="1290">But it's interesting because I spent -- we had to think of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all of this -- and I had a year, a little more than a year of private tutoring from a retired German teacher, and he said that he couldn't get over the fact that I would be a little child in one sense and a grown man in another when we discussed things and I imagine that was the same with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1291">Although, with my mother, we discussed -- there was a lot of reminiscing about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, you know -- where was this, what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1292">But I was a child, I played, I did everything.</sentence><sentence id="1293">I wasn't at that point -- this was in 1946, 1947 -- how old was I?</sentence><sentence id="1294">14, 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="1295">I couldn't speak German too well.</sentence><sentence id="1296">Again, this was sort of the interesting part; it took me a while to get back into German because I had</sentence><sentence id="1298">Thomas Buergenthal 39 November 28, 1995 Page 39 spoken much more Polish than German, and it took me sort of a month or two to be fluent again in German even though at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we used to speak German and Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1299">I spoke German with my mother and father when we were together and Polish with my father when we were alone.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1320">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1321">And things would come back and you would talk about this or that and another thing that is so interesting, people often think that when people get together from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, all we'd talk about were all these terrible things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="1322">The truth of the matter is that we often laughed about things in retrospect, about things that happened that were funny, about this or that happened.</sentence><sentence id="1323">So the human spirit -- you couldn't take all this if it were only reminiscences about all the terrible things.</sentence><sentence id="1324">So my wife often sort of marveled about the fact that even in recent years when my mother and I would get together we would talk about these things and talk about them often and remember this funny thing, and remember this.</sentence><sentence id="1325">It wasn't only remembering the terrible things that had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1326">I imagine it was probably when I was little we talked more about those things.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1356">Q: So that was a situation where perhaps the Germans were going to surrender or leave and they just emptied out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> by killing people?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1398">Q: When you think back to when you finally got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and you're with your mother, those first few days, and you're looking around and all of a sudden your life is beginning to look a little more normal, do you, I mean, was there one moment when you sort of remember looking around, maybe going to a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> with your mother and saying, "Okay, this is pretty normal, my life is normal now?"</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1400">A: No, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1401">I think I assumed that my life had been normal from the very beginning.</sentence><sentence id="1402">The fact that it wasn't normal was part of it being normal, this was all part of the life that I had lived.</sentence><sentence id="1403">I mean you would think that going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for example, would be difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1404">It was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1405">It was very difficult initially for my</sentence><sentence id="1407">Thomas Buergenthal 42 November 28, 1995 Page 42 mother but this was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> she really could go back to.</sentence><sentence id="1408">My mother always told the story with a very bad conscious, very guilty, because she was standing on the <span class="DLF">street corner</span> in her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and an old lady came up to her and asked her to help her across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and my mother said, "Nobody helped my mother across the <span class="DLF">street</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1409">This was right after she came back.</sentence><sentence id="1410">Then for years she would talk about it and say how terrible it was that she had acted that way.</sentence><sentence id="1411">So you know, we had all of those feelings.</sentence><sentence id="1412">But then I went there to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> initially but at first the thought to go with these kids whose fathers had killed my father.</sentence><sentence id="1413">But then you realize that these are people you don't know whether they killed your father, most of them probably didn't, and you make friends.</sentence><sentence id="1414">And you find for example, we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with somebody, who was, a Catholic family that had actually helped the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, had been in danger themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1415">And so that sort of abstract hatred becomes transformed into the fact that they're human beings regardless of whether they're Germans or not Germans and not every German was guilty.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2084">A: Well you know, I've never brought a human rights case.</sentence><sentence id="2085">I've always thought that I could be much more effective in the <span class="REGION">human rights area</span> by not being an activist in the sense of being a lawyer filing cases, but an academic who could be perceived to have a legitimacy when he spoke on human rights issue that wasn't driven by political considerations.</sentence><sentence id="2086">It wasn't driven by other considerations and that had no political agenda other than concern for human rights.</sentence><sentence id="2087">And that has been enabled me, Thomas Buergenthal 61 November 28, 1995 Page 61 in fact, to be on a <span class="BUILDING">human rights court</span> and be put in positions of being able, I think, to do a great deal in the <span class="REGION">human rights area</span>, and to be taken seriously in the <span class="REGION">human rights area</span> without being viewed as somebody who has a political agenda.</sentence><sentence id="2088">I think it's very important for <span class="BUILDING">NGOs</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2089">and activist organizations to do the work that they're doing, but it's also important for people to be seen as committed to human rights and committed to the advancement of human rights who aren't political activists in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2090">And I've always thought that I could do much more by doing that, by staying above the sort of political foray, and that was particularly important in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>, where from the beginning if you spoke about human rights you were perceived to be a Communist.</sentence><sentence id="2091">As a matter of fact, I founded the InterAmerican Institute of Human Rights in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span>, precisely in order to legitimate just a discussion of human rights, which when I first came I was involved with <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> in the late 70s, the discussion of human rights wasn't a legitimate subject, it just became aggressive political discourse between the right and the left.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And so my sense has always been that some of us, at any rate, can contribute much more through teaching and through serving as impartial arbiters in this <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2093">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">teaching area</span>, I -- my former professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> and | -- did the first American case book in international human rights.</sentence><sentence id="2094">We established the teaching of international human rights in the <span class="BUILDING">American law schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2095">And our book came out in 1977 and Thomas Buergenthal 62 November 28, 1995 Page 62 before then only three of us taught the subject.</sentence><sentence id="2096">It's now taught in almost all <span class="BUILDING">American law schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2097">And, you know, I have a little book for students on the teaching of -- on international human rights, which actually the subject has suddenly taken on a life of it's own not only in <span class="BUILDING">law schools</span> but every <span class="NPIP">place</span> else, which it didn't have when I first started in this <span class="DLF">field</span> in the late 60s.</sentence><sentence id="2098">Nobody was interested in this <span class="DLF">field</span> and in the international -- the American Society of International -- didn't even consider human rights to be a subject of international -- so I worked in both of these <span class="REGION">areas</span> and I thought it was always very important.</sentence><sentence id="2099">Philosophy -- that's the philosophy I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="2100">To my mind the most important thing in this <span class="DLF">field</span> is not to let yourself be politicized; that's the biggest danger that I see.</sentence><sentence id="2101">People who promote human rights, when they politicize the subject, do a great deal of harm to the victims because they then debilitate themselves in being able to protect victims.</sentence><sentence id="2102">Also I've learned a great deal of patience in this <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2103">It takes a few lifetimes to be able to achieve anything.</sentence><sentence id="2104">But, you know, the most gratifying thing is to -- it's often occurred to me when I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zepuan</span> (ph) sitting on the case or when investigating human rights violations in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> or now at the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span> -- to think that somebody who had survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is given the opportunity to be working in this <span class="DLF">field</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="2105">It's a wonderful -- it's a gift, it's a blessing when you think about it, you know, that I've been given this opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="2106">It's exciting and that's what sort of makes this all for me.</sentence><sentence id="2107">Every time I sit on something that sort of brings back the memory, it seems to me to</sentence><sentence id="2109">Thomas Buergenthal 63 November 28, 1995 Page 63 say that it's almost as if there was something written that I'm supposed to be doing this.</sentence><sentence id="2110">The irony, the poetic justice of my doing this, comes back so often.</sentence><sentence id="2111">It came back particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> where so many things that I saw reminded me of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> from the massacres to the executions.</sentence><sentence id="2112">But to think, you know, to think of the cold Polish winters and the tropics of <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span>, yet the same cruelty, and for me to be able to be involved in this, it boggles the mind in many ways.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2152">Q: I'm not sure most people would make that connection unless they had your experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, that there was a kind of similar, I guess, brutality going on between treatment of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and what happened during the worst of the civil war in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2154">A: Well, you know, it struck me long ago when I read Solzhenitsyn!deg books about the gulag, that the unimaginative cruelty, it's always the same.</sentence><sentence id="2155">You know, when you read what happened in the <span class="BUILDING">gulags</span>, you say, "Gee, this is exactly what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2156">And then in <span class="COUNTRY">El Salvador</span> for example, when the only survivor there described the massacre.</sentence><sentence id="2157">When she began talking, I could have finished the story for her.</sentence><sentence id="2158">I was struck by the fact that I could have continued about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2159">It's the same, I mean this brutality and the same thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2160">There is no -- evil has sort of a monotone to it.</sentence><sentence id="2161">I don't know, that is the thing that always strikes me, that I just can't get over.</sentence><sentence id="2164">Thomas Buergenthal 64 November 28, 1995 Page 64</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2179">Q: How do you think your personal experiences shape -- how do you think your personal experiences shape what you actually decide to do in certain situations with a case?</sentence><sentence id="2180">Perhaps when you're sitting on a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> -- or maybe the link is not that direct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2183">A: The link is probably there and it's not there.</sentence><sentence id="2184">In other words, it doesn't and it shouldn't shape the outcome of the decision.</sentence><sentence id="2185">What it does, it's you have a much better sense of the reality in which an event happened.</sentence><sentence id="2186">It's as if, you know, if I were a judge sitting on a commercial case and I'd been prior to that a lawyer practicing in the <span class="REGION">commercial law area</span>, I would have a much better sense of dealing with this material than somebody who came out of some other <span class="NPIP">environment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2187">Well, it's a little the same for me when I deal with a human rights case.</sentence><sentence id="2188">This is a reality.</sentence><sentence id="2189">When I hear somebody describe a certain situation, there is an understanding of what could have happened and also doubts raise when somebody tells you something, you say whenever that doesn't sound right.</sentence><sentence id="2190">And you can make those, you can have those doubts only if you've lived through something similar.</sentence><sentence id="2191">So to that extent there is a connection, and to that extent it's very useful.</sentence><sentence id="2192">But it shouldn't affect your decision- making process.</sentence><sentence id="2193">But of course, there is the empathy that comes out of the experience, is there.</sentence><sentence id="2194">And I think people shouldn't be in human rights if they don't have some empathy for what it is to be subjected to violations.</sentence><sentence id="2195">But I don't know, sometimes you wonder and you say to yourself, you know, something at the UN Thomas Buergenthal 65 November 28, 1995 Page 65 now where it's different from being on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2196">You sometimes go very fast through a lot of material and you say, "Gee, we have 140 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, 80 <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> from which we can receive reports, individual cases.</sentence><sentence id="2197">Death penalty cases, people on death row for 18 years, things like that.</sentence><sentence id="2198">And you wonder, you know, you sit on this and what <span class="DLF">in-roads</span> do you really make?</sentence><sentence id="2199">But it's only a very -- I have that in very few moments when the going gets tough.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2256">Q: Have you ever written about your personal experience, whether it would be for some sort of publication, or even maybe perhaps for your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2258">A: Well, after my bypass operation in "93 I decided -- my kids have been pressing me for a long time -- I decided to begin writing.</sentence><sentence id="2259">I've written about three or four chapters.</sentence><sentence id="2260">But I've come to the conclusion that I need -- I can't do it by myself.</sentence><sentence id="2261">I'm much too much a lawyer when I write.</sentence><sentence id="2262">It doesn't -- I describe things rather than -- and I've actually discussed it with somebody, that she might work with me.</sentence><sentence id="2263">Because what I write sort of comes out wooden in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And I don't deal -- I'm particularly bad in describing emotions.</sentence><sentence id="2265">But it's obvious that one needs to write it down and things come back that have long been forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="2266">I was struck by the fact that just sitting behind the computer and thinking of a certain event, a lot of things come back, names come back that I thought I'd forgotten and 50 years later suddenly the name of a camp commandant comes back to me, or the name of a <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2267">That's the wonderful thing about doing that and I'll continue doing that.</sentence><sentence id="2268">The problem is that academic books come in between them, and then other assignments that sort of -- I have about three of four chapters.</sentence><sentence id="2269">And I did write actually in <span class="BUILDING">Bethany college</span>, I did write one story and they had a publication.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2282">Q: Fiction or nonfiction?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2284">A: No, a story about the death march actually, that I reread in order to give the talk at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- on the 50th anniversary of the</sentence><sentence id="2286">Thomas Buergenthal 67 November 28, 1995 Page 67 Holocaust, of the death march.</sentence><sentence id="2287">And I had to sort of go back in order to even recall some things.</sentence><sentence id="2288">No, it should be written down.</sentence><sentence id="2289">I've given some interviews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2300">Q: You said, "It's obvious that it should be written down."</sentence><sentence id="2301">You said that just a while ago.</sentence><sentence id="2302">Then you just said, "It should be written down."</sentence><sentence id="2303">Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2308">A: Well, first of all, it should be sort of written down for the family.</sentence><sentence id="2309">What strikes me about this whole thing is that when my kids were little they had no interest at all.</sentence><sentence id="2310">I mean, they sort of knew, and as they got older, they're now in their late 20s and early 30s, they now say, "Write it down."</sentence><sentence id="2311">And they would say, "Well, why didn't you tell me that before?"</sentence><sentence id="2312">You know, this story or that story.</sentence><sentence id="2313">But at the time really when they were young they had no interest whatsoever, at least none that I could perceive.</sentence><sentence id="2314">But now they really are very interested and they want to know this and that.</sentence><sentence id="2315">So that's one reason.</sentence><sentence id="2316">| think the other reason is that these things should not be forgotten and those of us who have survived and who have the ability to recollect and express themselves about that have an obligation to put it down.</sentence><sentence id="2317">It's the kind of thing that if nothing else, hopefully it will have an impact on the future, at least in making people think about how you can prevent those things.</sentence><sentence id="2318">And also, you know, this notion about some of the Holocaust deniers, here is an answer at least that this happened.</sentence><sentence id="2319">The further away we get from it, supposedly, more of this denial is going to come about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2332">Q: It seems that that's been a struggle from day one, that the Allied forces actually took Germans and showed them the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at a certain point.</sentence><sentence id="2333">Have you ever in your own</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2358">A: Yes, I am.</sentence><sentence id="2359">I became an American citizen in "57.</sentence><sentence id="2360">As a matter of fact, it was -- I think I'm one of the few people who became an American citizen with the help of the FBI because I had won the nomination for the Rhodes scholarship from <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethany</span> and then from the state of West Virginia, and I wasn't a citizen yet and in order to compete in the finals I had to be a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="2361">A lawyer in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> who had been an FBI agent and who was also a former Rhodes scholar moved all kinds</sentence><sentence id="2363">Thomas Buergenthal 69 November 28, 1995 Page 69 of things to get me my citizenship, get me cleared very fast so that I could get it.</sentence><sentence id="2364">I had been in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> long enough but it would have taken much longer.</sentence><sentence id="2365">But I managed to get it and I managed not to get the Rhodes scholarship because I couldn't explain in the finals why I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when I had just gotten to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, which was very difficult to explain, and I really was lost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2378">Q: They asked that specific question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2380">A: They asked me a lot of other things and all of that seemed to be going well until they said, "Well, you've just become a US citizen, why do you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2381">And I really didn't have a good answer and so I think that was one of the reasons.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2384">Q: After you became a citizen, what was it like for you -- and this would have been more recently, when there were very open Nazi rallies in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2385">What were your thoughts about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2388">A: Well, I really think that the reaction to the Nazi rallies here have been wrong ones.</sentence><sentence id="2389">I think that one should let the people march, one should do what the Norwegians did when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2390">At one point, when they had a Nazi demonstration, the people all came out led by the bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oslo</span> and when the marchers walked by, all of the people in the <span class="DLF">street</span> turned their backs to them in silent demonstration, which to me is the way they should be handled.</sentence><sentence id="2391">If you start fights and everything, that's exactly what they want.</sentence><sentence id="2392">And first of all, I think in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> we have enough other mechanisms to deal with it that we don't need to prohibit those marches.</sentence><sentence id="2393">Let them,</sentence><sentence id="2395">Thomas Buergenthal 70 November 28, 1995 Page 70 but deal with them with dignity and not pay any attention to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2505">A: Oh, yes, I remember what you asked me, about when I looked at my children, how I would react.</sentence><sentence id="2506">Well, you know, every so often when children were sort of my age, I would look at them and I would think, could they survive this?</sentence><sentence id="2507">You know, this is the age and look, they are such children and this was the age that I was when this happened.</sentence><sentence id="2508">Then you somehow think, yes, they could have.</sentence><sentence id="2509">When you see street children in <span class="REGION">Latin America</span>, how street-smart they are and how they survive, you realize kids have that in them.</sentence><sentence id="2510">I've seen this in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>, I've seen it in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Guatemala</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2511">These kids have that survival instinct.</sentence><sentence id="2512">But when you look at sort of, our</sentence><sentence id="2514">Thomas Buergenthal 73 November 28, 1995 Page 73 children you say, "No, they could never make it."</sentence><sentence id="2515">But the fact is they could.</sentence><sentence id="2516">There's tremendous resilience that children have, some children.</sentence><sentence id="2517">Some children may be more sensitive than others but I think children are blessed with this resilience that enables them to survive better than grown-ups can survive in many situations.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2580">A: Well, this is what I try to tell you, that those of us who went through it all went through it because we were lucky in everything else.</sentence><sentence id="2581">But also in a sense, and I'm still able to talk about it today, is because we weren't just weighed down by the terribleness of it, that we didn't let it affect our whole life.</sentence><sentence id="2582">One has to be able to laugh about things, get raving mad.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And some <span class="NPIP">things</span> are funny, some <span class="NPIP">things</span> are sad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
