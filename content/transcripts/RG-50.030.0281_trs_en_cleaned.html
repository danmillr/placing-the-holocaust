<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="33">Q: What did your parents do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="35">A: My father was -- he actually had two faculties.</sentence><sentence id="36">He was an architect and an engineer.</sentence><sentence id="37">He studied outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had very strict admission for Jews in their <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, so my grandparents sent him to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">And he was mainly an engineer in his last years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: So around about -- well, tell me what you remember of the middle 1930s.</sentence><sentence id="44">Do you remember changes happening and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="47">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="48">Well, in the middle 1930s, I -- in the beginning of the 30s, I attended the <span class="BUILDING">German gymnasium</span>, which was the best in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">But with the change in the political situation, my parents switched me to a <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">And, unfortunately, I was sort of isolated.</sentence><sentence id="51">I didn't feel any pressure, any political pressure.</sentence><sentence id="52">Anything that was coming, I was unaware of it.</sentence><sentence id="53">We had a group of friends.</sentence><sentence id="54">In the summer, we were going away, and we had a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">And it was quite a satisfactory life.</sentence><sentence id="56">However, in 1938 and "39, the changes started to occur.</sentence><sentence id="57">We read about the rise of Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which was neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">We were aware of the speeches; however, we still felt pretty safe and secure.</sentence><sentence id="59">My uncle, who was a physician, had many patients</sentence></p><p><sentence id="60">01:04 who were of German origin, so-called Volksdeutsche then living in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">And when he visited them, because at that time, a doctor visited patients in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they were wearing signs.</sentence><sentence id="62">They were wearing swastikas in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">There were pictures of Adolph Hitler.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="64">And we still didn't take this too seriously.</sentence><sentence id="65">Seriously enough of thinking of leaving.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: And then tell me what happened when the war started and how you remember it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: I remember distinctly September "39.</sentence><sentence id="68">The Ist of September was the first day of war, and I remember there are certain moments that are crystallized in your memory.</sentence><sentence id="69">They're etched so deeply, and I remember exactly the moment.</sentence><sentence id="70">I was sitting on a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, reading a book.</sentence><sentence id="71">And all of sudden, I heard a thud, a tremendous thud sound, and I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> circling above the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">I wasn't even afraid; I didn't know with what to associate this, that this was the day that the war started, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> came over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">I did not know that they crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> at that moment, but I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and the thud.</sentence><sentence id="74">And it startled me, and I got up and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">This is something that is etched in my memory.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Did your parents talk?</sentence><sentence id="86">Did you hear your parents talking?</sentence><sentence id="87">Did they know what was happening?</sentence><sentence id="88">Were they afraid?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: My father died a year before the war.</sentence><sentence id="94">Two years before the war, excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="95">Two years before the war.</sentence><sentence id="96">He suffered from uremia, and at that time, there was no cure for it then.</sentence><sentence id="97">There were no dialysis known to medicine.</sentence><sentence id="98">And I was with my mother, and my mother was being courted at the time by a friend, a physician.</sentence><sentence id="99">So they were rather happy.</sentence><sentence id="100">The clouds of the war were sort of coming, but yet we did not realize to the fullest the seriousness of the situation of -- in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="BUILDING">lyceum</span>, which was equal to <span class="BUILDING">junior college</span> here, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="101">And the radio started to play national Polish hymns and the patriotic speeches, and we were listening to people telling us that we were invincible, which was very laughable because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did not have the technology that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> possessed.</sentence><sentence id="102">In a few days, the Germans went in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, which was not that far from the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">And while Germans were coming with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, the Poles were fighting on their beautiful horses with lances, dressed beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="104">Being patriotic and brought up in the spirit, everything was beautiful to me, but the reality of what was happening was ugly.</sentence><sentence id="105">Very soon after that, the Germans started to issue laws.</sentence><sentence id="106"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curfew</span> was one of the first.</sentence><sentence id="107">We were not permitted on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> past, I believe, 5 o'clock, I'm not too sure about that hour.</sentence><sentence id="108">We were required to wear yellow stars with the sign Jude identifying us as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="109">The money was frozen in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, and we started to be very frightened.</sentence><sentence id="110">One particular time, I was walking on a <span class="DLF">street</span> not too far from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I was called by a German officer.</sentence><sentence id="111">He called me, motioning with his hand to come over.</sentence><sentence id="112">My heart was beating wildly.</sentence><sentence id="113">I crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">He asked me to go upstairs to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and being a young girl, I was just petrified.</sentence><sentence id="115">He asked me to clean the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">He took his gun off, put it on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and was sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> next to it watching me.</sentence><sentence id="117">Well, I didn't know too much about cleaning, but I cleaned very fast, and I did what he asked me to do.</sentence><sentence id="118">And he looked at me, and he said in German "It is a shame that you are a Jew," and he let me go.</sentence><sentence id="119">This is another of the moments that I will never forget.</sentence><sentence id="120">After that, I wasn't going out too much.</sentence><sentence id="121">My mother and my grandmother tried to shield me.</sentence><sentence id="122">Since the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that we were living in belonged to -- this was a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which belonged to us, we knew many German people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, Polish people of German origin.</sentence><sentence id="123">And my grandmother, who is very wise, asked one of them to come and be sort of a supervisor of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, so she made an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">It was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and we did not have to display anything on the <span class="DLF">door</span> identifying us as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="125">So for a little while, we were spared.</sentence><sentence id="126">However, pretty soon the Germans caught on.</sentence><sentence id="127">One day -- this is another of these moments -- one day there was a ring.</sentence><sentence id="128">An officer with an aide came to the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">The officer had a scar on his face identifying him as a student who had dueled probably in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Germany University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">He also had a black skull on his head, a skull which identified him, I think, as a member of SS, and we knew what that was, Gestapo SS.</sentence><sentence id="131">He walked into the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">My grandmother, who was very fluent in German and knew that he represented danger, asked him if she could contribute to the German Red Cross, money.</sentence><sentence id="133">She thought that she would mollify him and that he will leave.</sentence><sentence id="134">At which point, he hit her.</sentence><sentence id="135">He had suede gloves, and he hit her with a gloved hand across the face.</sentence><sentence id="136">He proceeded from <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a man and was pointing to things which struck his fancy, and the young man started to pack them.</sentence><sentence id="137">At the end of one of our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span> filled with fern greens, and there was a <span class="DLF">cage</span> with a canary hanging there.</sentence><sentence id="138">Once he saw the <span class="DLF">canary</span>, his whole appearance changed.</sentence><sentence id="139">He became enchanted with the bird, and he asked us "Is this a male or a female canary?</sentence><sentence id="140">How lovely does he sing."</sentence><sentence id="141">He was a changed man.</sentence><sentence id="142">At that moment, I realized that a canary was more important, had more meaning to him than all of us human beings.</sentence><sentence id="143">This is one of the moments that I will never forget.</sentence><sentence id="144">The man was an educated man; I knew that.</sentence><sentence id="145">And we were nothing, but the canary represented something wonderful to him.</sentence><sentence id="146">He was mesmerized by the <span class="DLF">canary</span>, and he beat my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="147">Well we were staying in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for some time until the Germans started to throw people out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I need to explain the term of "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>" to many people and children who are listening to me.</sentence><sentence id="148">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is an isolated part of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> situated in what used to be a very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and consisted of several blocks of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">And we knew that we are going to be thrown out.</sentence><sentence id="150">And since we knew somebody that was an engineer who was well acquainted with my family who lived at the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and he asked us, since he was being evacuated, if we could live in his little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and take care of it, which we agreed to greedily because it was clean.</sentence><sentence id="151">It had three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and had a <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">And a <span class="DLF">garden</span> was very important because there was some food growing there and we moved there.</sentence><sentence id="153">After a while, they started to send Czechish refugees, Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, and they were being assigned <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was small; there was not much <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">Well, we received a couple, a husband and wife -- a charming, lovely couple whose children were being kept by some Czechish neighbors, Christian people who helped to save the children.</sentence><sentence id="156">And the couple stayed with us for a while.</sentence><sentence id="157">But we were being already used to the rations, and we were deteriorating at a slower rate than they.</sentence><sentence id="158">They were thrown in directly from the good life to the very, very bad, and they both died fairly soon.</sentence><sentence id="159">We were all being starved, and my grandmother had an idea.</sentence><sentence id="160">The so-called "Aelteste der Juden", you wouldn't know which one.</sentence><sentence id="161">The man who was in charge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> was named Chaim Rumkowski.</sentence><sentence id="162">Before the war, he was an agent for an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and collected money for the orphans.</sentence><sentence id="163">Since my family was involved in charitable work and donated money to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, my grandmother decided that I should go to see him and ask him for some help because there was some sort of help.</sentence><sentence id="164">There were so- called talons (ph), small pieces of paper for some food distribution, and I went to see him.</sentence><sentence id="165">It's another moment in my memory.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was a long <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">He was at the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and I was at the other one, at the other end.</sentence><sentence id="168">I was led in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I said to him in Polish " Panye President," which means Mr. President.</sentence><sentence id="169">And at that moment, he picked up a cane and wanted to hit me because he resented the fact that I didn't speak Jewish to him, which I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="170">So I quickly told him "I am from this-and-this family."</sentence><sentence id="171">And at that, he stopped and said, "Where do you live?"</sentence><sentence id="172">Then I gave him the address and I left.</sentence><sentence id="173">He sent next day somebody with few of the pieces of papers for some sugar and for me to work in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> for three months.</sentence><sentence id="174">And that was a life-saving because I could eat some bread in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>, and I could take some small pieces <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and my ration card was being used by my family.</sentence><sentence id="175">This lasted three months.</sentence><sentence id="176">Three months later because they were changing -- three months later, he remembered me.</sentence><sentence id="177">He had fantastic memory.</sentence><sentence id="178">He switched me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was called <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> -- some sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">They were feeding for two weeks soup to workers who were essential to their production in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">You see, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had several <span class="BUILDING">establishments</span> working for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="181">In order to stay alive we were obligated to produce some work.</sentence><sentence id="182">In that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, I worked as a waitress.</sentence><sentence id="183">And one day about a week later, this Mr.Rumkowski's sister-in-law came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and she saw me and she said, "Cut your hair," and I didn't understand why.</sentence><sentence id="184">And said, "Out," and she threw me out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">Well, that was a tragedy because that's where the food was.</sentence><sentence id="186">I spoke to the aide to Mr. Rumkowski, who was afraid of her because she thought that she was a princess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">People had very wrong ideas about themselves.</sentence><sentence id="188">He was instrumental in assigning me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where they were peeling potatoes, and I was very happy about that.</sentence><sentence id="189">I was peeling potatoes all day long, and trying to steal some of the peels to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because peels meant food.</sentence><sentence id="190">All this ended soon after.</sentence><sentence id="191">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being systematically emptied.</sentence><sentence id="192">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>; people were being sent away.</sentence><sentence id="193">At that time, even Rumkowski couldn't help.</sentence><sentence id="194">He had several people whom he knew from before the war from helping the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> or whatever, and he sent -- I don't remember the number -- maybe there were 40 or 50 of us young women to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> at the outskirts called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianske</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">And we were there, working there in some meaningless work we performed.</sentence><sentence id="196">We were supposed to build cement blocks for the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were being ruined in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">They were trying to have <span class="DLF">cement blocks</span> to build some sort of shelter.</sentence><sentence id="198">We were there for a while, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being systemically emptied, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> after another.</sentence><sentence id="199">And Rumkowski amongst them.</sentence><sentence id="200">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were going then from August 1944, and after a while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was almost empty.</sentence><sentence id="201">My mother and I and some of my friends were still fortunate enough from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, which contained 500 people.</sentence><sentence id="202">There were two groups left in the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">One was ours from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marianske</span>, and one was hidden on a <span class="DLF">street</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jakuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">I only know about it because I had a friend who was hidden there.</sentence><sentence id="205">At that time, I was not aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="206">The 500 of us were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> had a couple of physicians with their families.</sentence><sentence id="208">There were children.</sentence><sentence id="209">We slept, my mother and I, in a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with about 20 other people.</sentence><sentence id="210">I think we had -- I don't remember if there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span>, but we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">We would lie down in <span class="DLF">rows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">For a small infraction, a couple of people were being taken away and sent away.</sentence><sentence id="213">The German who was in charge of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called Hans Bebolt (ph), typical, extremely good-looking man.</sentence><sentence id="214">Blonde, typical Aryan appearance; he was brutal.</sentence><sentence id="215">He selected one of the girls and then he shot her.</sentence><sentence id="216">This was the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">There was one incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which I forgot about.</sentence><sentence id="218">If I may, I'll go back to this.</sentence><sentence id="219">When we were still living in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this gentleman who gave it to us and we were so very hungry, we decided that I will try to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to people that we knew from before the war who lived in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">They were of German origin, but Polish.</sentence><sentence id="221">Their name was Mensel family.</sentence><sentence id="222">I took my star off, the Jewish star, and I smuggled myself through the <span class="DLF">wires</span>, and I walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">with the fear in my heart looking at people, looking at little dogs which reminded me of my dog that I had to leave at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, everything seemed very normal to me.</sentence><sentence id="224">But I knew that I didn't belong there.</sentence><sentence id="225">Finally, I reached the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we left, and I walked up a very broad <span class="DLF">staircase</span>, my heart was beating wildly because I didn't know how they will react to me.</sentence><sentence id="226">Will they let me in?</sentence><sentence id="227">Maybe they moved.</sentence><sentence id="228">It was a long time, and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and it was opened by young Nina, who was the daughter of the family.</sentence><sentence id="229">As she looked at me, I saw the terror in her eyes.</sentence><sentence id="230">She was stricken with terror looking at me.</sentence><sentence id="231">And I was taken aback, but after a minute, she composed herself and put a finger to her lips indicating that I shouldn't speak.</sentence><sentence id="232">I found out that there were some German people invited to dinner.</sentence><sentence id="233">They were some sort of relation of Mr. Mensel, and she brought me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and Mr. and Mrs. Mensel saw me and hugged me and gave me dinner.</sentence><sentence id="234">I ate with them dinner.</sentence><sentence id="235">I was sitting at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> looking at the tablecloth, looking at the proper appointment on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">And J ate like a normal human being, and I started to resent the fact that I had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">I almost forgot about everybody else that I left.</sentence><sentence id="238">But, of course, the situation changed in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="239">After some small talk, the man was -- the German was in life, he was a professor.</sentence><sentence id="240">He had a great deal of knowledge, and the conversation was so welcome to me, so normal, and I was not used to it anymore.</sentence><sentence id="241">And young Nina helped me, she said to explain to them that I came for some books.</sentence><sentence id="242">And the books, of course, was food.</sentence><sentence id="243">And she and her mother prepared some food, and I was already getting nervous because the curfew hour was coming.</sentence><sentence id="244">And they gave me some parcels and said that I'll be back.</sentence><sentence id="245">The young soldier wanted to see me next week, and all my friends said that they will let him know if I'll be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">And I took the parcel, and I started to walk towards the <span class="DLF">wires</span>, towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">Again, my heart was beating wildly.</sentence><sentence id="248">I was so, so very frightened because there were German patrols going on both sides of the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">And I had to time myself to a split second when they turned around and won't be there.</sentence><sentence id="250">And when I saw that he turned around, I ran to the <span class="DLF">wire</span>, so I spread them through the parcels, and I caught part of my dress

say a word because in a few days we will be liberated."</sentence><sentence id="1423">We knew the fire was -- we were liberated April 20-something when the Russians reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.993984" long="11.769816">Wittenberg</span> and displaced the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1424">They had no time to lull us.</sentence><sentence id="1425">The plan was to kill us, but they just plainly didn't have time and I survived.</sentence><sentence id="1426">As a result of the beating, I have to wear a brace for the rest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="1427">I did not have proper medical care, because the Russians were too busy fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1428">They did, however, provide bandages which they rolled around me, strapped me when we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1429">I asked them, so I was rolled in their bandages.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And that was maybe one thing that I was not very useful to them.</sentence><sentence id="1431">I wear a brace.</sentence><sentence id="1432">As a result of the brace and the ribs that didn't heal properly, I developed tremendous curvature of the spine which worsened with the advent of my pregnancy.</sentence><sentence id="1433">The doctors warned me that this would occur, but I didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="1434">I thought that I do have to have a child.</sentence><sentence id="1435">I owe it to my family.</sentence><sentence id="1436">I owe it to myself, and I owe it to my people.</sentence><sentence id="1437">And I have been blessed.</sentence><sentence id="1438">I have a wonderful daughter, a wonderful son-in-law, British.</sentence><sentence id="1439">I have a a wonderful grandchild.</sentence><sentence id="1440">I have wonderful husband.</sentence><sentence id="1441">So in some way, somewhere my family up

wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And another <span class="NPIP">place</span> there was very good reception was the Navy Intelligence Unit.</sentence><sentence id="1446">And one of the questions that always pops out is "How did you permit this to happen?</sentence><sentence id="1447">Why didn't you defend yourself?"</sentence><sentence id="1448">See, young people in the Navy, strong, hopefully intelligent -- if they are in the Intelligence Unit, they must be very bright.</sentence><sentence id="1449">They cannot perceive the conditions that we were in.</sentence><sentence id="1450">We were surrounded by population which was not only unfriendly, but openly hostile to us.</sentence><sentence id="1451">We couldn't have a gun if we would beg them on

id="1454">We were absolutely helpless.</sentence><sentence id="1455">Many people gave up, committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1456">A number of them, because they did not want to continue this way.</sentence><sentence id="1457">Many people gave up because they thought somebody from the family would stay.</sentence><sentence id="1458">Many people said, "Is this what God wanted for us?"</sentence><sentence id="1459">And yet, many people died with God's name on their lips, so there is no one answer to this 02:41: question.</sentence><sentence id="1460">Then they asked me "Can you forgive?"</sentence><sentence id="1461">That's different question.</sentence><sentence id="1462">I cannot forgive the people who did it.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I can't ever forgive them, but I have to forgive the younger people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because they were informed.</sentence><sentence id="1464">And I have to give them the opportunity to show their outlook on life.</sentence><sentence id="1465">They are not guilty.</sentence><sentence id="1466">They did not participate.</sentence><sentence id="1467">Some of them who were born of Nazis trying to repent for their fathers.</sentence><sentence id="1468">Of course, there are some pro-Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1469">There are neo-Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1470">But we have everyone everywhere, wherever we are.</sentence><sentence id="1471">We have always a group of people who are, I would say, inferior, and to show their so-called superiority, they think that other people are not up to their par and do not deserve to live or do not deserve -- whatever is their philosophy.</sentence><sentence id="1472">But I dismissed them.</sentence><sentence id="1473">I have to forgive the young people.</sentence><sentence id="1474">There is nothing to forgive, the ones who didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1475">As a matter of fact, when I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> through the Quaker Society, I arranged to have German young people who were exchange to 8 visit us, to share our meal and to discuss things with them.</sentence><sentence id="1476">Not of the past, but for the future because that's what we are talking about, the future.</sentence><sentence id="1477">We are interested in the future, and I think that I made some strides there.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I think that's important.</sentence><sentence id="1479">I think this is part of the philosophy of our <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, to talk about the future.</sentence><sentence id="1480">That the past should never be forgotten, but it should never be repeated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
