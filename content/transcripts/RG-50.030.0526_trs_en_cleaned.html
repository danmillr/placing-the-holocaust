Holocaust Education Trust, but he decided -- a local rabbi, Barry Markus, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and he took a group of people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for the day and then somehow they got together with a group of other people and they decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust, which is a working people, it's not a -- they work there full time, and what they do, they also teach teachers about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2876">Teachers that have retired, or they want to be in teaching profession any more, and they devote their time for that.</sentence><sentence id="2877">They do it -- they get paid for it, naturally, otherwise they couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="2878">And they do seminars for young people.</sentence><sentence id="2879">But the Holocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2880">Now that,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2884">6 after that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they decided they would be able -- they can afford to take two groups of children, around 200 people -- there would be like 160 children.</sentence><sentence id="2885">There" 11 be teachers from each <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2886">Because it's not as a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it's about 80 <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2887">They take two students from a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you see, local, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, plus teachers, plus journalists.</sentence><sentence id="2888">And they take them just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late.</sentence><sentence id="2889">And they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">birk</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2890">The main thing is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2891">And they come back and they've got the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like me, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2892">They know very little about the second World War.</sentence><sentence id="2893">But now it's a thing that they've got to learn in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it's -- it's a must, it's not whether they want or not.</sentence><sentence id="2894">But how much is not -- doesn't come into it because how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2895">So they go -- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Trust does is they bring them -- they get them together, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="2896">Then they get another seminar, then they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and when they come back they go to write about it, what they thought of it, what they -- the whole thing and they've got to send it in to the Holocaust Education Trust, and a panel sits then pick four <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> of two children each and they got to come back to the <span class="BUILDING">Houses of Parliament</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">House of Lords</span>, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think, they're int -- they're interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the survivors are also there, a few of us.</sentence><sentence id="2897">And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2898">So what they have to do, they've got to go to other <span class="BUILDING">local schools</span> and tell them all what they saw, what they heard.</sentence><sentence id="2899">And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I like young people, and I think it's very, very imporstant they should know what happened, because -- and they are lovely students, most of them.</sentence><sentence id="2900">I've never had any problems, you know?</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2904">7 It's as quiet as anything, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask questions and -- you know, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2905">Q: What kind of questions do they ask?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2906">A: Well, all different.</sentence><sentence id="2907">Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they want to know whether I met Hitler, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2908">I haven't been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but that th -- one of the main question, it's always asked is, do I hate the German people.</sentence><sentence id="2909">And they cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people.</sentence><sentence id="2910">Why should I hate people for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today.</sentence><sentence id="2911">You know, they're grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="2912">And most German people are the same as any other people.</sentence><sentence id="2913">Why should I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know?</sentence><sentence id="2914">Do I ask me -- do I forgive them?</sentence><sentence id="2915">Now the people that did it, I haven't got the right to forgive.</sentence><sentence id="2916">If there is a God, God can forgive them.</sentence><sentence id="2917">The others are the people that died can forgive.</sentence><sentence id="2918">I certainly haven't got the right to forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate.</sentence><sentence id="2919">Because this is not an answer, to hate.</sentence><sentence id="2920">You are the one that will suffer if you hate.</sentence><sentence id="2921">So no, I -- I love the questions.</sentence><sentence id="2922">Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual thing, how did you survive?</sentence><sentence id="2923">I wish I could tell them.</sentence><sentence id="2924">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2925">It's one of those things.</sentence><sentence id="2926">People that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God wanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story?</sentence><sentence id="2927">I said maybe, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2928">But I feel it's very important it should be told.</sentence><sentence id="2929">We've got to have awareness of what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2954">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2956">A: Because you know, in another few years there won't be -- the only thing you'll be able to do is to read about us, what happened to the people in Europe between 1933 and 1945.</sentence><sentence id="2957">There won't</sentence><sentence id="2959">8 be anybody, you know, to substantiate the story.</sentence><sentence id="2960">So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you can be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust survivor.</sentence><sentence id="2961">I have been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I have seen with my own eyes.</sentence><sentence id="2962">And I feel that's important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
