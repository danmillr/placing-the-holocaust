<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">RICHARD SEIBEL September 14, 1990</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Would you please state your name and your <span class="BUILDING">birthplace</span> please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Richard R. Seibel retired Colonel in the United States Army.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born and raised, and still live, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">I was ordered to active duty from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="8">I reported for active duty June the 9th.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="14">Would you give us little information about your background and your childhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, I would say that my background is that of a normal school child, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="18">I played, participated in all sports.</sentence><sentence id="19">I lived with my father and mother.</sentence><sentence id="20">My father was born and raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when he was 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="21">My mother is a native Ohioan from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span>, her ancestors were some of the original settlers in <span class="REGION">Northwest Ohio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">I spent my entire life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">I was the director of purchasing at a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> when I was ordered to active duty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Do you have brothers and sisters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Yes, I have two brothers, and they are both deceased now.</sentence><sentence id="34">In fact, they both died in the same week.</sentence><sentence id="35">And so I had a funeral for each one of my brothers in the same week.</sentence><sentence id="36">Prior to that I had another brother and sister but they were deceased when they were very young so that I never knew them.</sentence><sentence id="37">They were about 2 years old, I guess, when they died.</sentence><sentence id="38">I spent my entire life...I joined the reserve unit and somebody said, "Why did you ever join the reserve?"</sentence><sentence id="39">And I said, "Well, I felt 1 owed an obligation to my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and my family and my God and that's the reason I was in there."</sentence><sentence id="40">They said, "Yeah, but if you hadn't been in the reserve, you would have never been in combat and war two."</sentence><sentence id="41">I said, "Well, that's beside the point."</sentence><sentence id="42">I joined the Reserve, no prior military experience and I did it all by correspondence, if you will, and association with the Ohio National Guard.</sentence><sentence id="43">And I received my commission as a Second Lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="44">And that was in 1934.</sentence><sentence id="45">And then I remained in the Reserve, which was nothing at that time, until I was ordered to active duty on June, the 9th, 1941, 6 months before Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="46">I was then ordered to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span>, <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>, which was quite an experience, I can assure you, because it was the training center for all of the selective service people.</sentence><sentence id="47">We trained all of these people for a period of 13 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="48">Then comes Pearl Harbor, and the <span class="DLF">roof</span> fell in, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="49">Things changed completely.</sentence><sentence id="50">All the guards that had been on duty in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> previously had only blank ammunition, and from that time on, they were issued ball ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="51">All civilian clothing was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the entire training was stepped up and it was changed from 13 weeks to 11 weeks because we were in a hurry, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="52">And that is when the entire military concept of training and combat and everything else changed, from that time on.</sentence><sentence id="53">I was sent on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop train</span> shortly after Pearl Harbor, probably 2 weeks after that to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ord</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>, with, as I recall, about 250 trainees who were being deployed to the Pacific.</sentence><sentence id="54">And the <span class="REGION">West Coast</span>, they were scared to death.</sentence><sentence id="55">Believe you me, they were.</sentence><sentence id="56">They felt that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> were going to come in, but they never did, of course.</sentence><sentence id="57">And so that was the beginning of extensive training for combat in World War II.</sentence><sentence id="58">Shortly thereafter, I was ordered to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Poke</span>, <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span>, to a new division, the 11th Armored Division.</sentence><sentence id="59">We started training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Poke</span>, <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span>, with all new troops and from thereon, we went to Louisiana maneuvers and from there we went to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> for desert training, and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ord</span>...or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Cook</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>, and then from there overseas to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and from there to <span class="REGION">Continental Europe</span> to meet the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="60">That is briefly my background and our training in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was prior to crossing the <span class="DLF">channel</span> for combat, and we were ordered in the combat...we had crossed the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span>, and we were supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.6805298" long="6.1656646">Nancy</span>, to come up from the south, and that's when the ball changed.</sentence><sentence id="61">And so we were immediately changed from going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.6805298" long="6.1656646">Nancy</span> to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Meuse River</span> to prepare the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Meuse</span>...all the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Meuse River</span> for demolition.</sentence><sentence id="62">We were not to contact the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="63">The Combat Command A on our left was supposed to probe, and not to meet them in any fire fight of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="64">So we then crossed, and we went in through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neufchateau</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">And it was shortly thereafter that we hit that Bulge head on and we got hurt.</sentence><sentence id="66">I don't mind telling you.</sentence><sentence id="67">But we had good people in our organization, well trained, and then we caught our breath, if you will, after that first engagement and continued on, and when through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxemburg</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, a short distance and back out, and into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and that's when we wound up with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: When did you first arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: In <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>?</sentence><sentence id="106">I don't know for sure.</sentence><sentence id="107">01:08 It probably was the latter part of April of 45 because we were stopped, and it was May the 5th, when the <span class="DLF">restraining line</span> stopped us which is across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from...we were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span>, which was Hitler's birthplace.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: What did you say...what caused your stop at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: The <span class="DLF">international restraining line</span> the agreement was made at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="44.5" long="34.166666">Yalta</span> between Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt where they divided Europe which Berlin Wall was a result, plus the occupation of all of <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="114">That, in my humble opinion...of course, that's all changed now, was that's the worst thing that even happened in Europe, was that <span class="DLF">international restraining line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">01:09:</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: How did it come about that you came across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: We sent a patrol out in a effort to keep in contact with the enemy or to contact the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="122">And since we couldn't go any further than the <span class="DLF">restraining line</span> which was approximately a mile or so on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> that's how we found it, because we were probing and that's about the best I can say is that in our attempt to keep contact with the enemy or contact the Russians, here was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: What happened after you came across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: We had this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> and the patrol leader called in by radio and said that we have across something that we are not sure what it is.</sentence><sentence id="128">It's a big <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of some kind, and there are people running all over.</sentence><sentence id="129">I said, "Well, is there any combat or shooting of any kind?"</sentence><sentence id="130">He said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="131">I said, "Well, you return.</sentence><sentence id="132">Bring the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> and come back."</sentence><sentence id="133">And they reported into the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and told me roughly what it was, and so I reinforced the patrol and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">And that is when I made a complete inspection and came back and reported into General Degar, our division commander and told him what it was, and it was shortly after that report that he said to me on the telephone, "Dick," he said , "You will return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> and take command."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: What did your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> tell you they found?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Just a lot of people, lot of bodies, lot of people running around.</sentence><sentence id="146">There was no control of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="147">These people were strictly on their own and no one knew what was going on or what the situation was.</sentence><sentence id="148">Really and truly.</sentence><sentence id="149">They were like lost sheep.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: So you went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> yourself for the inspection.</sentence><sentence id="156">What did you see and what did you inspect?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, first of all, all of these dead bodies piled up, like cord wood if you will.</sentence><sentence id="160">Sick people, dying people, starved people.</sentence><sentence id="161">And you take to an American such a sight as that, you can't imagine it.</sentence><sentence id="162">Things like that don't happen, but they did.</sentence><sentence id="163">And so we were actually and truly...the people that were with me, they were all dumbfounded.</sentence><sentence id="164">And when we went back the second time, I went in and went into the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and the Russian major who had been a prisoner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="165">He was sitting behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and through an interpreter, I asked my interpreter to ask him what he was doing there?</sentence><sentence id="166">And he said well, they were in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">They were going to run it, and they had all ready established a tribunal for the death of certain people.</sentence><sentence id="168">I said, "Will you please tell him that this is in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>, and that we are here and we are occupying the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it's our responsibility and we're going to run it."</sentence><sentence id="169">And he still wouldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="170">So I (laughing) I pulled my pistol out and I reached across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I pointed it right in his face and through the interpreter I told him to tell that so and so that ifhe didn't get out of there, I was going to shoot him.</sentence><sentence id="171">And he and his party left immediately. (</sentence><sentence id="172">Chuckle) And so that was our initial on the takeover of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">My interpreter who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>...he's a Czech.</sentence><sentence id="174">His name is Primisol Dovias, and he remembers that to this very, very day 01:14: because he and I correspond rather frequently and he a short time ago was telling one of his Canadian friends about what had happened, and I had letter from this (laughing) Canadian relative to our takeover and Primisol's part of the takeover.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Did you inspect the physical surroundings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Oh, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: What were they?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Terrible shape.</sentence><sentence id="199">The SS, when they left they disrupted the <span class="BUILDING">power plant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200">We had no lights, no power, no water, no sewage, no sanitation of any kind, and that is exactly what we found and we had to get that cleared up fast because of the health of the prisoners of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="201">Not only that, but my own people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: What did you do to straighten it out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: I wouldn't allow any of my people to handle any of these bodies or clean up any of the feces that were around or anything of that nature.</sentence><sentence id="209">I had all the prisoners do it, and I got one person from each <span class="NPIP">nationality</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">There were 21 nations represented in that camp.</sentence><sentence id="211">I got a representative from each <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> to pass on my wishes and desires, if you will, to the people of his own nationality so that they knew what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="212">Now, I think it was the second day.</sentence><sentence id="213">I'm not sure about this, but a fellow came in...one of my people came in and said, "You better come quick.</sentence><sentence id="214">There's trouble out in the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>."</sentence><sentence id="215">I went out and here's four bodies on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with their throats cut.</sentence><sentence id="216">There was fighting among people so there was only one thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="217">We got everybody <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> by force with bayonets if you will to clear the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, to get <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">We started at 8 o'clock in the morning and with a representative of each nationality, we segregated that entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> by nationality, got them...Germans altogether, the Russians together, the Poles together, the Czechs together, the Spaniards, the Italians, all of the <span class="REGION">Slavic countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">That stopped the political problems that we were having with the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they were fighting among themselves, and so we put a stop to that real quick.</sentence><sentence id="220">We, fortunately or unfortunately, we segregated in <span class="BUILDING">internal prisons</span> inside the main compound all the Russians and all the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="221">We would not let them associate with anybody else because they were troublemakers.</sentence><sentence id="222">And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I said, "Well, General, ...by an interpreter.., of course, I said, "You tell your people when they learn how to act, then they can get out, but not before."</sentence><sentence id="224">So that's some of the problems that we ran into which we never expected because we thought we were the great white liberators you know, and we're doing a tremendous job for these people, but it took them a long time to realize that we were there to help them, not to hurt them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: How many people did you have to administer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Eighteen thousand in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="245">We gathered up about 700 bodies, which we had to bury.</sentence><sentence id="246">We had no identification of any kind, and we buried them in the old <span class="DLF">Sports Platz</span>, which was the recreational area for the SS, playing soccer and baseball or whatever they played.</sentence><sentence id="247">The bodies, there were no identification on any of these people, and no one could identify any of them because some of them were in terrible condition.</sentence><sentence id="248">So we buried them in <span class="DLF">amass grave</span>, about 700.</sentence><sentence id="249">We put a cross up over each <span class="DLF">grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">Of course, they were buried without benefit of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> or anything because we had to get rid of those bodies.</sentence><sentence id="251">And from that time on, anyone who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> received a cross or a Star of David, with their names on it, and they were thoroughly and totally identified, but prior to that we couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="252">| would guess that there was something like 1300 people died while we were there, and they were all identified properly so that all records maintained their nationality and their name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Did you bring in <span class="BUILDING">medical facilities</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: We brought in two <span class="BUILDING">field hospitals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">Huge <span class="BUILDING">installations</span>!</sentence><sentence id="266">And anyone who had to be taken care of was assigned to these <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">Our medical records show that we had hospitalized, while we were there, about 5,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="268">And as soon as they were able to leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they left.</sentence><sentence id="269">And that's what we did until until the bulk of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">Now when I left there and my people and I left, there was only about 3,000 or 3,500 people left.</sentence><sentence id="271">And they...the bulk of those people didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">And there were quite a number of Jewish people left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that did not wish to return to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">homelands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">In checking with these people, the older Jew wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">The younger Jews wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, or to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">And so those...I don't recall how many there were, but those were the ones that were left and the other people just didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">Period!</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Were these Jews that didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or were these other?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: Other people that just didn't want to go back to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">homelands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">A lot of them were afraid to go because of what had just happened and what they had been through.</sentence><sentence id="294">Until it settled down.</sentence><sentence id="295">Now I don't know...I do not know the results of the 3,500 people, but I know that I was told that they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> for Jews, and all the Jews that were left in the camp were all sent to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> in I believe it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">At least it was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Were there any special problems that related to the Jewish inmates particularly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: No. [</sentence><sentence id="305">had no problems at all.</sentence><sentence id="306">In fact as I mentioned to you previously I did not recognize a Jew as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="307">He was a human being just like anybody else and therefore he was treated as such.</sentence><sentence id="308">We did our dead level best for him to forget his past We put all of the Jewish population in with their own nationality because I didn't feel that they should be segregated like they had been previously and so mistreated, that we put them in with their own people, all the Germans, the Hungarians or whatever they might be, whatever their nationality.</sentence><sentence id="309">They went in, but they didn't go in as Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Did any of the Jewish population have any feeling about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: They did, but then they got over it.</sentence><sentence id="319">I had a lot of pressure put on me from the Zionist organization from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span>, why did I do that?</sentence></p></dialogue>

(</sentence><sentence id="736">laughing) We got a tremendous charge out of that, but then we found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> of dehydrated vegetables which we started adding to the potato soup which enhanced it a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="737">Then the doctor said, "Well, they're coming along pretty good."</sentence><sentence id="738">So we started butchering horses, and we feed them horse meat, bread, dehydrated vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="739">Not soup, but dehydrated vegetables, and potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="740">And my oh my, what a change in their diets.</sentence><sentence id="741">And fortunately, none of them got sick, but yours truly, I sampled every meal of food that was served in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to make sure that what they were getting was good because I had supervisors in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, but the prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were doing the cooking.</sentence><sentence id="742">But my mess people, they were supervising so I wanted to make sure that what they were getting was good so I had a sample of every bit of food that was served in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="775">Q: Where did the horses come from?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="777">A: The <span class="REGION">countryside</span> where...in fact, there were a lot of German army horses that had been driven ahead of the combat.</sentence><sentence id="778">And I was surprised to learn that the Germans used hundreds or thousands of horses in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> for transportation.</sentence><sentence id="779">The first time that we found that out was 2 when we were going toward the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> and all of these horses, just hundreds and hundreds of them had come up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and, of course, the Germans took off and went across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and here's all these horses.</sentence><sentence id="780">That was long before we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, but that's where a lot of the horses came from, and plus any that we decided that we needed to take care of our people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="785">Q: Did any of the surrounding civilian population help?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="787">A: They didn't help a nickel's worth except when we started burying all the bodies that we found, we went to the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and around and got their services to handle these bodies and bury them.</sentence><sentence id="788">And oh my or my, did that create 01:51: a terrible outcry among the people and I know there was a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="789">One of them was a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="790">And my chaplain was my chief burial officer, and this dentist was giving him a bad time.</sentence><sentence id="791">He said he wasn't going to do anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="792">Now, Dave Kinsler was the Chaplain (Laughing).</sentence><sentence id="793">He hauled off and hit him. (</sentence><sentence id="794">Laughing) When Dave told me about, I said, "That's all right."</sentence><sentence id="795">But some of the people objected because it was a lousy job.</sentence><sentence id="796">Really and truly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: You said you were there for 35 days.</sentence><sentence id="810">What caused you to move on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="813">A: We were transferred out from that particular <span class="NPIP">part</span> and I can't think of the name of the infantry division that came in and took over after we left, but we were moved down into the Austrian Alps to be on so-called combat occupation because the Werewolves were supposed to be starting up again down in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> where we were going and we were to combat them if necessary, but it never happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: The new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> that came in, did they administer the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="818">I lost all contact with it after...after we left I knew nothing of what went on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="821">Q: Any final comment you'd like to make?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="823">A: No, except that I'm terribly sorry that it happened and I don't know how you can stop it really and truly.</sentence><sentence id="824">They're having miserable problems in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> now and I'm a little worried as to what might happen there.</sentence><sentence id="825">The treatment of the Jew, I don't understand it to this day.</sentence><sentence id="826">Why?</sentence><sentence id="827">Just because a person was a Jew, why they were segregated.</sentence><sentence id="828">While we were there, there was a special ambassador by the name of Edward Pauling who was sent by President not Roosevelt, Truman to contact and make a survey, if you will, of the Jewish population and the elements around, and it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in particular.</sentence><sentence id="829">I have a letter from him at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> thanking me for what...all the information and everything that went on while he was there.</sentence><sentence id="830">He spent a whole day interviewing the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="831">And he told me that in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the best they could estimate, there were only 25,000 Jews left in the whole 3 <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="832">That's that's extermination wholesale really.</sentence><sentence id="833">To this day, there are a lot of people that do not understand what the Holocaust was.</sentence><sentence id="834">A lot of them don't want to know.</sentence><sentence id="835">It's not very pleasant history.</sentence><sentence id="836">School children.</sentence><sentence id="837">My goodness gracious, I have spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school children about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="838">Showed them pictures and everything else, and it's kind of hard for those children to believe that actually and truly happened.</sentence><sentence id="839">But somehow or other, the children of this world and the young people of this world have to be apprised of what happened so that it never happens again.</sentence><sentence id="840">It can't happen again because 01:55 it...it more like...I just can't describe it.</sentence><sentence id="841">I... truly can't because until you have been involved with a thing like the Holocaust it's very difficult to explain it to people and have them understand.</sentence><sentence id="842">Another thing that happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> with the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="843">They brought about 700 of them in and said that they were all dirty and they needed a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="844">So they took them in a big <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> and they all had nice, warm showers and they brought them all out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>, the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>.</sentence><sentence id="845">Nude and squirted them with a fire hose in very, very cold weather until they all died.</sentence><sentence id="846">And if they didn't die from exposure and shock the first time, they took them back in and give them more showers and brought them back out until they were all dead.</sentence><sentence id="847">Now, again, I didn't see that, but that is official testimony and I'm sure that if you're to check with any former prisoner of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> they could verify what I have said.</sentence><sentence id="848">A gentleman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>...he is a Czech by the name of Boshak, who is a prisoner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a Czech, a very intelligent man, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> to see me.</sentence><sentence id="849">He'd been a prisoner there.</sentence><sentence id="850">He was a Czech and I think he was an attorney and he had married a lady and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">But I had an interview with President Benes of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, a wonderful discussion with him.</sentence><sentence id="852">And he was talking about Hitler and all the rest of the things and they used <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>...they had sent a lot of radio and press people, magazine people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> to write about it and question everybody and they used <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> as a horrible example of Nazi atrocities.</sentence><sentence id="853">He was rather flowing and enjoying in his admiration for the American people.</sentence><sentence id="854">And this I gotta say.</sentence><sentence id="855">Do you know that there wasn't one solitary person, except two French nurses, that came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that ever lent a hand.</sentence><sentence id="856">Not one other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in this world never helped at all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> with any assistance of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="857">That's kind of hard to believe. (</sentence><sentence id="858">laughing) These two French nurses came in one night about 2 O'clock. (</sentence><sentence id="859">Laughing) I couldn't speak French and I had a heck of a time.</sentence><sentence id="860">Finally, some...found somebody that could interpret, and they were there to help with the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the sick people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="900">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="902">A: I don't have anything else.</sentence><sentence id="903">I trust I haven't bored anybody with what I'm speaking of, but it's a long time ago and people have asked me, "How can you remember all of these things so vividly?"</sentence><sentence id="904">I said, "Well, it only happens to you once in your life time, and you can't forget a thing like that."</sentence><sentence id="905">People said has it affected you mentally or otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="906">I said, "No, I just...just one of those memories that you let go by."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="914">Q: Appreciate the interview.</sentence><sentence id="915">You did not bore anyone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="918">A: Well, it's my pleasure to be here and anything that I can do to further the movement of the teaching of the Holocaust, I'm happy to do.</sentence><sentence id="919">I didn't mention this previously, but I was on the State of Ohio Holocaust Commission where we met once a month.</sentence><sentence id="920">I was there but it was primarily, I think, for educators, because they were working up a curriculum for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in the State of Ohio, and it was adopted and we all put a hand to it.</sentence><sentence id="921">It will now become a part of the educational system in the State of Ohio, the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="922">Which is good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
