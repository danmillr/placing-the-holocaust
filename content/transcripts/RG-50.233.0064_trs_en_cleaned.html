<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2">That was my mother's father.</sentence><sentence id="3">And neither do I remember my father's father, who had apparently had died before I was born.</sentence><sentence id="4">I do remember my father's mother and I do remember my mother's mother.</sentence><sentence id="5">My father's mother lived near us but we never spent as much time with her as we spent with my mother's mother.</sentence><sentence id="6">I don't know why that is but I suppose that is sort of par for the course, it happens everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="7">And uh .. my mother's mother really did go along on all vacations with us -- and sort of -- while she did not live with us -- she lived in her own <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- we saw her much more frequently.</sentence><sentence id="8">Every Friday night we went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for Friday night dinner which for some traditional reason was not chicken but rather was roast beef -- or whatever -- roast beef and roast potatoes or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="9">I am not quite sure.</sentence><sentence id="10">Oh, I would like to talk briefly about my first memories of the Hitler rise to power and socialism and what I overheard in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>. --</sentence><sentence id="11">Um.. the first, the first real memory that I have of a discussing about Hitler was -- or about National Socialists -- was one night when we were visiting my uncle -- this was my mother's brother -- who also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> -- who also had been born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> -- but by the way, they did not live too far away from where the Reichstag was.</sentence><sentence id="12">We saw the <span class="DLF">sky</span> turning red and over the radio we heard that there was a fire in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reichstag</span> and at the time, I remember a conversation that my parents had with my uncle about that particular event and about how they thought that it probably was a staged event and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="13">My father was fairly conservative, fairly nationalistic German.</sentence><sentence id="14">I think now that if there is a political equivalent in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> now you would probably say that he was very much a conservative republican and he felt that this ... first of all, I think ... basically I suspect, that while he never said so, he probably felt some sympathy for some of the things that Hitler stood for.</sentence><sentence id="15">Not of course with the persecution of the Jews but with national pride which my father I believe shared and he always ... [remember one of the things that he always used to say was, "Well, this is an aberration and this man will mellow and change his mind about the Jews, particularly the Jews that had served <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the war and so on and so forth, or else he will be replaced with someone from his party that doesn't believe in all that nonsense and if it doesn't work out, we will leave on the "last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>"."</sentence><sentence id="16">Whatever that "last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>" meant, we never caught it.</sentence><sentence id="17">We didn't make that last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">I am trying to think back now, I am trying to be a little bit ... go more a little bit in time.</sentence><sentence id="19">Probably about "35 or "36, things started changing in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Jewish children could no longer attend the regular <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and I had to go to what was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in the backyard of a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in a fairly old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the older part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">And it was necessary for me to either take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> ---- to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator train</span>, or walk.</sentence><sentence id="21">And, I still remember some of my teachers and uh -- that was not .. I think the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very good.</sentence><sentence id="22">Uh... I think I missed some of my friends from the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> but I got used to it very quickly and that's when I started, in addition to having regular schooling, I started to have religious instruction also.</sentence><sentence id="23">Peculiarly enough, even so that we belonged then to a reformed <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, the religious instruction that I received was Conservative Judaism -- the <span class="BUILDING">reform synagogue</span> did not have any <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">Uh .. I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a couple of years and then, you know, I was probably seven, eight years, nine years old and while one is not ...</sentence><sentence id="26">really does not .. is not too politically cognizant of what is going on.</sentence><sentence id="27">I did hear a lot of conversation about Jewish doctors being no longer allowed to treat non- Jewish patients, Jewish attorneys no longer being allowed to practice cases, other restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="28">Also, my father complaining that some of his gentile customers no longer would buy from him or were afraid to buy from him and uh ... there was a general deterioration in the quality of life ... not the quality of life so much but the economic aspects of life.</sentence><sentence id="29">As far as I can recall, the quality of our life really continued pretty much as it had before.</sentence><sentence id="30">We continued to take our summer vacations, we continued to go to our <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neunehagen</span>, my parents continued to go to concerts and to the opera and when I reached this age, they took me once in a while and all those things were opened up to us and we continued to have a ... I believe an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> and I believe there came a time when we could no longer drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> because Jews could no longer drive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pleasure vehicles</span>, and my father had to sell it and was pretty disgruntled about that.</sentence><sentence id="31">But meanwhile, he kept saying, "Well this will go away and this will blow over and this is just temporary" and his business was still fairly good so he wasn't complaining.</sentence><sentence id="32">So things pretty much continued.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="67">Q: Did he take over that <span class="BUILDING">business</span>?</sentence><sentence id="68">Was it pretty much ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="71">A: Yes, he was really running the business.</sentence><sentence id="72">Since my grandfather died, he was really running the business.</sentence><sentence id="73">He was doing it.</sentence><sentence id="74">Maybe this was really ... for all I know, he might have gone in the business because my grandfather was sick or was dying or something like that ... that there would be continuity for the business -- that might have very well been the reason.</sentence><sentence id="75">Um ... when I left <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>, which was probably around 1937 or 1938, I don't remember exactly anymore, we had to go to a different <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- what was known as an <span class="BUILDING">upper school</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> kind of thing -- but it was not called a <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> because there were not supposed to be <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">It was called <span class="BUILDING">Jude Schule</span> Nacht Liebplan und UberSchule -- UberSchule meaning an <span class="BUILDING">upper school</span> kind of a thing.</sentence><sentence id="77">And In fact my parents tried to encourage that aspect in me and had me join the Maccabean soccer league and I had boxing lessons and stuff like that which I was never really good at.</sentence><sentence id="78">I was just as bad at my piano lessons, I was never any good at that either.</sentence><sentence id="79">In any event, that became a problem.</sentence><sentence id="80">Then came the Kristallnacht on November 9, 1938, and at that time, my father's business was all smeared up on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with "<span class="BUILDING">Jewish Store</span>" kind of a thing.</sentence><sentence id="81">Even so, it wasn't really a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- it was a <span class="BUILDING">wholesale business</span> -- people couldn't really go in and buy.</sentence><sentence id="82">It was painted with big letters and people were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and discouraging customers from going in.</sentence><sentence id="83">Many of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were burned down -- in fact, most of them.</sentence><sentence id="84">And that was a turning point in the general prosecution er ..persecution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="85">It really, from then on, everybody's life sort of became miserable who was still left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Was your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> vandalized?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="106">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was not vandalized -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was fine.</sentence><sentence id="107">There was no problem with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="108">Uh..</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: Did your father go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> and open the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: My father, yeah, my father went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">I think he probably closed for a day or two but he still had one or two non-Jewish employees who stayed really with him until the end and in fact, I had been corresponding with one of them soon after the war and I sent him some food packages when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> after the war but ... Llost track of him and of course he has to have been dead for many years now.</sentence><sentence id="117">And uh ... my whole life started to change after November 9", First of all, that summer -- my mother -- we had been on vacation, I believe in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hartz Mountains</span> which are <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in <span class="REGION">lower Saxony</span> and my mother became ill, while we were on vacation and she had to be brought back in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">an ambulance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="119">I guess it was some sort of bleeding if one sort or another and she died soon the after of Leukemia.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: The summer before Kristallnacht?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: That was the summer of 1939, so it was really a sort of double whammy that year.</sentence><sentence id="128">First my mother dying and then Kristallnacht was that November.</sentence><sentence id="129">My father -- soon after, my father became ill or at least did not feel well.</sentence><sentence id="130">I think that a lot of it had to do with -- probably a lot of it had to do with my mother's dying -- it had to do with the deterioration of the business -- the general hopelessness if the situation and he still kept saying "This won't last -- this won't last."</sentence><sentence id="131">But then he started, I believe, trying to get us out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">But after 1939, it was really quite difficult -- the <span class="REGION">European countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> would not take uh .. Jewish refugees at that time.</sentence><sentence id="133">For the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, you had to have a relative who guaranteed your financial support.</sentence><sentence id="134">We knew nobody here so that was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="135">My father made some tentative tries to get to a South American</sentence><sentence id="137"><span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I will tell you more about that later.</sentence><sentence id="138">I think he made some contacts in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> and I think some work was done along those <span class="DLF">lines</span>, hoping to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Was your father ever taken for forced labor?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="155">He was not.</sentence><sentence id="156">He was never in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, he was never in any forced labor -- he was never really hurt in any way.</sentence><sentence id="157">Uh ... my father, I remember living of course with my father and we still had a maid, or a servant in those days.</sentence><sentence id="158">That was a problem too, I believe that sooner or later, we weren't allowed any more to have a non-Jewish servant living in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> so I think she became a day person who would come in.</sentence><sentence id="159">My father became ill and died on December 19, 1940 of tuberculosis.</sentence><sentence id="160">Tuberculosis was then, still a very dread disease.</sentence><sentence id="161">Today of course, it has been eradicated -- or maybe it's coming to the fore again -- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="162">But in any event, people would die of tuberculosis and people would talk of tuberculosis like we talk of cancer today.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: Do you recall him being ill in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Yes, I recall him being ill and I recall him coughing and I recall him going to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I recall visiting him.</sentence><sentence id="175">Of course, you couldn't go to the regular <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, you had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> -- he went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and died in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">After my father had died, my grandmother liquidated their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I moved in with her.</sentence><sentence id="177">That's my mother's mother.</sentence><sentence id="178">My father's mother had died in between somewhere -- somewhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span> - - probably I would say 1935 or 1936, somewhere along that <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">But as I said earlier, we weren't really that close to her.</sentence><sentence id="180">So from 1940, after December 1940, I moved in with my grandmother and moved in with her.</sentence><sentence id="181">I remember my Bar Mitzvah -- which was a very small affair -- but I did have a Bar Mitzvah -- and I guess because of my grandmother, it was in an <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">But it was a very small thing in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> afterwards with some people coming over.</sentence><sentence id="183">Nobody could have big festivities any more -- you couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> any more and you couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">concerts</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="184">My grandmother wasn't involved in that kind of thing anyhow -- all that stuff after my mother died.</sentence><sentence id="185">Uh..I continued with my schooling while I live with my grandmother and we received a notice in January 1942 to report for resettlement on let's say on about the 20" of that month.</sentence><sentence id="186">I can't be sure of the correct date, but around the 20" or 21 of January 1942.</sentence><sentence id="187">We reported to a very large -- one of the few <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> that had been left standing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: That's where you were told to report?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: That's where we were told to report.</sentence><sentence id="206">One of the few <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> that had been left standing and they cleared out all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and everybody was on blankets -- sitting on blankets on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and slept there for a day or two while we were being registered.</sentence><sentence id="207">We were allowed to bring, I think one suitcase each and uh .. | remember my grandmother had me put on double clothing -- two</sentence><sentence id="209">pairs of pants and two shirts and things like that and she took a hundred mark note and wrapped it up -- wrapped a yarn around it so it would look like some extra sewing material and gave me that to keep in my pocket which turned out to make no sense at all but you know, those are things that people do when they don't know where they are going.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: Did you pack something special?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: No, my grandmother did the packing.</sentence><sentence id="219">Incidentally -- while I was living with my grandmother, she was pursuing this uh ... this Chilean trip or immigration and nothing ultimately came of it.</sentence><sentence id="220">I remember even taking lessons because uh .. to learn how to make marzipan so that she would be able to have something that you can make a living in if she came to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I would help her do that somehow, it never came out too well when I did it.</sentence><sentence id="221">We practiced cooking marzipan in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so that we would have something professional or a trade if we ever got to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> but obviously, nothing ever came of it so as we received our notice in 1942, we registered and there were probably about a thousand people and they would -- as I read now, -- they would .. each of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would be about a thousand people would be put .. would be sent away.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">Q3 How did this notification come to you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: It came in the mail.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Just in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mail</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: It came in the mail.</sentence><sentence id="228">My grandmother, amazingly enough, did an inventory of all our household goods that we had to leave and I still have the inventory so I am trying to collect from the German government for that but who knows?</sentence><sentence id="229">Whatever -- whether anything will come of that or not.</sentence><sentence id="230">Maybe nothing ever will.</sentence><sentence id="231">It's amazing to see all these things -- she was very meticulous, I mean even to the extent of phonograph records as to how many were left behind and so on and so forth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: How much leave time did you have?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: We had about ... I would say it was about a week, ten days.</sentence><sentence id="240">That's really all we had.</sentence><sentence id="241">And we couldn't take very much so you didn't need much lead time -- I believe the suitcase could weigh no more than 30 kgs which is about 60 pounds -- it is less than we usually take on a vacation trip now -- so you really couldn't take very much.</sentence><sentence id="242">It turns out later on that we lost everything anyway so it doesn't make a difference -- the whole thing was academic.</sentence><sentence id="243">Um ... my last memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> uh .. were that, as we were leaving the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, my ... the principal of my ...of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that I had gone to was standing at the exit point and gave each person a hard candy and he said goodbye to me and I was surprised that he remembered me and then we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and the last</sentence><sentence id="245">sight that I remember of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> is that victory column that site in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiergarten</span>, it's just a monument -- nothing really special -- I believe it remembers -- it commemorates a victory in the war of 1870-71 against the French.</sentence><sentence id="246">Um...we were brought to a <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> and uh ... in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> -- you know, in regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> ... and they were locked and we started our journey.</sentence><sentence id="247">Many of the people, I remember, were fairly old -- I was the only child in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- the only youngster.</sentence><sentence id="248">I must have been about fourteen -- about thirteen and a half years old.</sentence><sentence id="249">It was soon after my Bar Mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="250">My Bar Mitzvah had been in May 1941 -- June 1941, so this must have been like since months after my Bar Mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="251">And uh .. there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> needs which were emptied from time to time -- the journey took, I believe, about seven or eight days.</sentence><sentence id="252">It was getting colder, the food was relatively inadequate -- this was in the middle of winter -- this was in January and we were headed East so obviously <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> have no heating facilities -- but there were enough of us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> so there was a certain amount of human warmth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: You were with your grandmother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: I was still with my grandmother and incidentally, while we were at the gathering point of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, I remember seeing my first person dying -- which is really sort of indelible in my mind -- I saw many, many more after that but there was a man on one of those blankets near us and all of a sudden, he started -- well, I guess he had a heart attack and just died.</sentence><sentence id="274">I mean, nobody did anything to him -- he just died and that sort of stuck in my mind -- I had never seen that before and it was sort of a frightening thing to a thirteen and a half year old.</sentence><sentence id="275">Q For your mother and father when they passed away, was it still possible to have a normal funeral service?</sentence><sentence id="276">A Yes, it was.</sentence><sentence id="277">There was a normal .. you know there is a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and one of the peculiarities of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Jewish community</span> was there was one very large <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> which catered to all the different religious -- religious Jewish denominations so it is a very gigantic <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- it's still in existence -- I have been back there two or three times and it is a very lovely, peaceful <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">And there is a very large family plot that accommodates both my mother and my father, my grandfather, my mother's brother, who died also of asthma probably somewhere in the 30's -- that plot is still there.</sentence><sentence id="279">O.K. -- how are we doing with the tape?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: We're O.K.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: O.K., we are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> -- or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> or whatever you want to call that thing.</sentence><sentence id="290">A number of people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> died, but after you see your first person dying, you sort of become immune to that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: Did you pass those bodies out at certain points or ...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: It was a closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, not an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="321">You know apparently in those days, from what I know now, there were open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> where people could come and go as they wished and there were closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> where there were <span class="DLF">fences</span> around them and you had to pass a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and you could only go out in order to work and that was for a specific work purpose -- you could not go out.</sentence><sentence id="322"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span> had been -- had always been a closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="326">Q: So they brought you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they said "Find a <span class="NPIP">place</span>"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: They brought us to ... they would count out a hundred people and say "Here is a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, this is it -- go to it."</sentence><sentence id="329">And it was amazing, in some <span class="NPIP">places</span>, there was still food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, of course everything was cold -- there were no in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment toilets</span> -- it had been a very poor part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">But there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> on each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> but because it had been left unattended for month or six weeks, all the toilet facilities were frozen and that became a real problem I remember during the first few months.</sentence><sentence id="331">Because, as you know, nothing unfreezes, it never gets above freezing -- so it was really a ... that was one of our little problems.</sentence><sentence id="332">Uh ... we sort of ... we didn't know what to do for the first few days, nobody really paid any attention to us -- they would give us food, they brought it around in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> -- in <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchens</span> and what have you, but ... I would say that probably for the beginning, the food was fairly adequate, there was enough of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: So you would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="341">We would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to get the food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Was there some type of Jewish council?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: There was nothing at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="350">All these things formed as we stayed there for a while.</sentence><sentence id="351">First of all, the biggest trauma that I experienced probably in my entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> life, was during the first two weeks of it and during the last three months of it.</sentence><sentence id="352">So let me go into the first two weeks of it so that I can tell you best as to what I recall best about it.</sentence><sentence id="353">As I said, I was with my grandmother who was in those days, probably in her early sixties and uh ... if 1 remember correctly, fairly old looking.</sentence><sentence id="354">It really fits the image -- she had gray hair and she was a little lady, maybe a little on the heavy side, not too ... but maybe a little on the heavy side.</sentence><sentence id="355">We were together in a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with two other people, with a single woman and a single man.</sentence><sentence id="356">I don't remember exactly how we slept -- all I remember is that nobody really had any purpose.</sentence><sentence id="357">I mean, everything was aimless, we just would -- I would -- you know being a thirteen and a half year old kid, I was kind of curious and I would walk around and scavenge around and look for things and try to get into <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that were not -- that were not occupied which of course you weren't supposed to do, but I really hadn't quite gotten used to the idea of imprisonment yet.</sentence><sentence id="358">Uh .. I would say that about the fourth or fifth day that we were there, when we went out to get our meal, they asked us for volunteers to help to sort clothes ad I said to my grandmother, "I think I'd like to go" and she said, no, don't go and I said "yeah, I want to do this.</sentence><sentence id="359">I have nothing to do."</sentence><sentence id="360">So I did, and I remember that they brought us into a big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and we had to sort.</sentence><sentence id="361">Apparently those were the clothes of the Latvian Jews which we of course didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="362">And we had to put sweaters with sweaters and pants with pants -- stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="363">I mean, something that a thirteen and a half year old could easily do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="379">Q: Were there other children there, that you recall?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="381">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="382">By that .. you know, the last few years, the only time I really saw children was at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">I mean, there was no way that you could play with other children, you know that ... and I really would spend more time with adults than I would spend with children anyways.</sentence><sentence id="384">So uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="389">Q: How long did the sorting go on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: Oh, that was just a day.</sentence><sentence id="392">It was just a day's job, it wasn't a big deal.</sentence><sentence id="393">And you know, when I made my way back, to this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where we were living but my grandmother wasn't there and uh ... I asked for her but nobody knew where she was.</sentence><sentence id="394">And then it turned out that a number of the older people had been taken away.</sentence><sentence id="395">And apparently the first, I know now ... but as far as I was concerned, she had just disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="396">But we know now that the Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> first experimented with those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> whereby they would direct the exhaust into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and uh .. while they were driving the people would suffocate and then they would just unload them and ... you know, go for the next load.</sentence><sentence id="397">Of course, later on, that turned out to be a very tedious and slow process and they couldn't handle very many people.</sentence><sentence id="398">They could only take like twenty or thirty people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and there wasn't really an efficient way for the Germans to do the job so they</sentence><sentence id="400">subsequently abandoned that method and used the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower rooms</span> and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="401">So uh... the first few days without my grandmother were really an extremely difficult time for me because I had always been a sheltered kid, had always been with adults, had always been with my family and uh .. it was really very traumatic -- to be all of a sudden by yourself and to ... it was a mixture of feeling lonely and feeling afraid and feeling scared and uh .. I wasn't really as much worried about my life as I was just at a loss about what happens now?</sentence><sentence id="402">Where do I go?</sentence><sentence id="403">Who is going to take care of me?</sentence><sentence id="404">And the realization that I would have to take care of myself or I wouldn't exist.</sentence><sentence id="405">I continued living in that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with these two single people for a ... for some time.</sentence><sentence id="406">I remember sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> while they shared a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="407">They turned out .. they became lovers later on which amazingly enough that people would think about those kind of things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but I guess, love is a pretty powerful influence, it comes right after food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="427">Q: Was this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> heated at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yes, there was heat.</sentence><sentence id="430">There was heat and there was, really I must say, there was heat and from what I can recollect, there was really adequate food.</sentence><sentence id="431">We were not starved.</sentence><sentence id="432">There was never really like a whole lot but there was enough.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: Twice a day you would get food?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: Yeah, twice a day we would get food and I continued working sorting the clothes -- I continued doing that and uh .. we worked no more than eight hours so it was a relatively normal workday.</sentence><sentence id="440">Most of the work that I did was done in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but I know that there were other groups that assembled -- there was a large square in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- that assembled, and they were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to do work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="443">Q: As a young boy, what was your impression of the S.S. or the guards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="445">A: Well, you know, one of the overriding and important thoughts that you have is that you worry about nothing other than keeping yourself alive and you go from day to day and that impulse intensifies, becomes more important.</sentence><sentence id="446">You hide from those that you feel can hurt you, you are anxious not to share anything that you have with those that are with you.</sentence><sentence id="447">There are stories now about many friendships having formed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">I have never experienced that and as far as I am concerned, I was very selfish and very self- contained.</sentence><sentence id="449">I was never able to get an advantage in any way whereby I could work a little less or get a little extra food, I was very anxious to preserve that for myself and not tell anybody else about it and so, if anything, that mentality was probably one of the ugliest aspects of our imprisonment because we became totally oblivious to those around us -- sometimes to the extent that if you saw somebody who was being kicked or beaten or abused or killed or hanged -- one of the feelings that would come to your mind first was boy, am I glad it's not me.</sentence><sentence id="450">And rather than feeling sorry for the first that this was being done to, and I think this</sentence><sentence id="452">was one of the, one of the dehumanizing and ugliest aspects of the whole ... of that whole situation.</sentence><sentence id="453">So, let me go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="464">Q: Do you recall the couple's names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="466">A: I recall their last names.</sentence><sentence id="467">It happened to be Levy in both instances.</sentence><sentence id="468">He was Hermann Levy I believe but I don't know what her name was.</sentence><sentence id="469">I mean .. there were .. again, we were .. we really lived along side each other not with each other.</sentence><sentence id="470">We didn't share anything and we talked but it wasn't ... it was just like strangers talking at a <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span>, that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="471">We really lived, just happened to be in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="472">After ... the ghetto life sort of normalized itself if you can speak of such a thing.</sentence><sentence id="473">There was a council of elders that had been formed and there was a <span class="BUILDING">ghetto hospital</span> and there was even, would you believe, a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> -- that was not a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, per se but there were services being held in somebody's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and uh .. whenever I could, I started going to services -- which were not well attended incidentally -- uh .. from what I understand, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> performed abortions because children were not allowed to be born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: Some woman : Excuse me, were there mostly Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: Yes, at that point there were mostly Germans and a few Latvian Jews and some Czechoslovakian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="485">In fact, we lived in <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> .. the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that I lived in was a <span class="BUILDING">Berlin building</span> and then there was a <span class="BUILDING">Hamburg building</span> and so on and so forth and there was a group from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">One of the ladies who lived in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> became the secretary to one of the elders -- the Jewish elders -- Alteste Rat as it was called.</sentence><sentence id="487">And through her, I became .. I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="488">then I guess he lost -- was stripped of his citizenship and was supposed to be deported and he is now on trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for his crimes.</sentence><sentence id="489">Probably now he is in his eighties so he will probably never ... never make it but in any event, that ..</sentence></p><p><sentence id="490">that became a fairly celebrated case.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="491">End of Side A.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="492">Start again at 000 on Side B.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: O.K.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="495">Q: What did you do on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commando</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="497">A: I think we also did lumber, we also did wood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="499">Q: Did everyone survive those commandos?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="501">A: Yeah, you know I haven't really spoken much about guards about suffering per se because, there really, in all fairness to the Germans, we didn't have much contact with the guards.</sentence><sentence id="502">There were very few S.S. men or guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- I mean we were just sort of like in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam cooker</span> -- we were left to cook by ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="503">There were obviously people -- guards at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> uh ... I don't remember any specific acts of cruelty or harassment in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="504">There were at work, if we didn't work fast enough, they would kick us or prod us with a shovel or rifle or something like that but it really wasn't the real gruesome things that you hear about --those really all came later and in the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">Uh ...I am going to try to put this in a proper time frame now.</sentence><sentence id="506">I stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> probably from the beginning of February 1942 until uh ... late in 1943 or maybe even the beginning of "44 and uh .. no, no, it wasn't that long -- excuse me, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="507">It was from the beginning of "42 until probably early "43.</sentence><sentence id="508">Then the Germans were beginning to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and were moving people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="509">Uh .. I would say it was somewhere in deg43, early 43, maybe middle of "43.</sentence><sentence id="510">It seems to me that it was either spring or summer, that the spring and summer in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> are very short and don't last long.</sentence><sentence id="511">Uh ... we were brought from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald</span>, and from there, where we really stayed a relatively short time, and</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: What was your job there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="526">A: Sorting.</sentence><sentence id="527">Just sorting and I was .. I was somehow ... I stayed with that sorting stuff, I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="528">Maybe I became a specialist -- I don't know (laughs).But there we were constantly supervised by the S.S. people and constantly harassed and constantly kicked and constantly you know ... annoyed.</sentence><sentence id="529">And uh...we slept in the typical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> arrangement where there were like ...they weren't <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> ... they were like big <span class="DLF">platforms</span>, one on top of the other, three high or four high.</sentence><sentence id="530">Everybody would lie in the ... on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and it was so crowded that you know, you couldn't really turn.</sentence><sentence id="531">You had to lie on your side and of course, men were separated from women in that situation.</sentence><sentence id="532">There were <span class="INT_SPACE">communal baths</span> and it was really like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="533">Incidentally, let me go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a minute.</sentence><sentence id="534">Uh .. from time to time, people would try to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and as they were caught they would be brought back and hanged and everybody would have to march by in the morning and they would generally leave hanging there for, especially in the winter time when everything froze, sometimes four or six weeks just sort of as a memento so that everybody could see it every day and I guess that was supposed to discourage us from running away.</sentence><sentence id="535">I must tell you that I really never had any thoughts about running away or anything like that because I couldn't envision myself... I had a difficult time enough getting along -- I had no contacts.</sentence><sentence id="536">I didn't speak Latvian -- I only spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="537">I mean there was just no way.</sentence><sentence id="538">Also our hair was cropped close and through the middle we had a shaven strip that was re-shaven probably every two or three weeks so ... and the women were completely shaven.</sentence><sentence id="539">Their heads were completely shaven so you would stand out from the population.</sentence><sentence id="540">I don't know how people ... I guess some people did get away -- you know, not many but I guess some people did.</sentence><sentence id="541">I mean there are many recorded instances known of people who actually ran away from .. especially from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and joining partisans or undergrounds or what have you.</sentence><sentence id="542">I don't know that there was much of an underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> because the Latvians really, from everything we could see, were really very much pro German and very much anti Russian and I think the Latvians were probably rooting for the Germans to win and uh .. I would say that the Latvians were basically more -- more the Latvians than the Lithuanians-- were probably more, more antagonistic towards us than many of the Germans were so I couldn't envision escaping into that element.</sentence><sentence id="543">Uh ... let me go back to where I was -- to the living conditions in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ABA 701</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="565">Q: A quick question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="567">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: -- You were obviously growing this whole time, were you able to find new clothing for yourself?</sentence><sentence id="570">Through your sorting were you able to pull through any ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="573">A: Well, you couldn't ... well, I'll tell you -- I did that once and it wasn't such a good thing.</sentence><sentence id="574">Uh ... it turned out to be a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="575">Uh ... well, you know, we had</sentence><sentence id="577">uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="578">We had those blue and white striped uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="579">Incidentally, for one reason or another, amazingly enough, I still have my uniform cap.</sentence><sentence id="580">I still have that.</sentence><sentence id="581">The original uniform cap.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="592">Q: That was once you were in this ABA --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, you wore civilian clothes and I don't know how I made out.</sentence><sentence id="595">I really don't .. you know, it was so long ago, some of that stuff just, just doesn't stick out.</sentence><sentence id="596">Um .. while I was in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ABA 701</span>, I stole a pair of shoes because my shoes were just completely gone and uh .. I muddied them up a little bit, you know the outsides so that they would look old.</sentence><sentence id="597">But of course, you couldn't disguise that and I was found out and uh .. I was called to the commander and first got a good beating and then he said, "Well, I guess we will have to execute you."</sentence><sentence id="598">So, I went back and I said well, I guess this is it.</sentence><sentence id="599">But somewhere later on, one of the guards came back and said " Well, he's changed his mind, all you have to do ..", he gave me an iron bar to carry and I had to carry it, you know there was a <span class="BUILDING">four floor building</span>, I had to carry that bar up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> for I don't know how many times .. fifty times, maybe a hundred times -- I don't know what it was, but that was my punishment and of course I got a pair of wooden shoes which was the worst punishment because I had to wear those for the next couple of years and it was really hard to walk on them.</sentence><sentence id="600">But ..</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="608">Q: Where did you find those shoes that you took?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="610">A: I took them from the ones, all the things that came in, the things that I was sorting.</sentence><sentence id="611">Uh .. before long, there wasn't really a whole lot of sorting to do, so instead of sorting clothes they switched us to loading and unloading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>, that came into the <span class="DLF">Riga harbor</span> and uh .. that was a lousy job because first of all, it was cold and it was wet and we then worked twelve hour shifts -- you either worked the night shift or the day shift and there was really no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide -- you were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> -- and the worst of it all was that the Russians used to come and bomb the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> all the time and we had really no protection -- all you could do was try to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> as quickly as you could and you know they had these flares that they would drop and the <span class="DLF">sky</span> would be lit up and they had machine gun <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and they ... in those days, the Russians we were really beginning to make substantial progress and were moving against the Germans -- pretty well down into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="614">Q: Were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ships</span> or just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ships</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="616">A: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Cargo ships</span> -- no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop ships</span>.</sentence><sentence id="617">We were loading and unloading ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="618">We were loading and unloading supplies -- if we were loading supplies, sometimes we would try to steal some of the food if we could and again, anybody that got caught really got into serious problems.</sentence><sentence id="619">Uh .. I remember taking a package once of something and under great personal peril and when I unpacked it, I found out it was mustard -- that just goes to show you that you never know about all those things -- so instead of food, I got mustard.</sentence><sentence id="620">Um ..I was very angry at that time</sentence><sentence id="622">because I had taken a tremendous chance to do it.</sentence><sentence id="623">It seems silly now but I didn't laugh then.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="734">A: I would say three or four days.</sentence><sentence id="735">I remember that there was no food on that trip and that was kind of gruesome but at least we were getting back.</sentence><sentence id="736">I think probably they didn't want to leave us or didn't want to leave our bodies for the Russians to find.</sentence><sentence id="737">I think really that was probably the rationale because I can't think of any other reason why they would take us back, because by that time, they didn't need us anymore.</sentence><sentence id="738">By that time, they had no more use for our labor because that was early "45 and you know .. the thing had completely disintegrated.</sentence><sentence id="739">It was either December deg44 or January deg45, I don't know which but it was probably December deg44, by that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was in such disarray that there was no work to be done anymore.</sentence><sentence id="740">As I said, the last time .. while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> towards the end, we were dismantling <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and shipping them back which was really one of those nonsense jobs kind of a thing.</sentence><sentence id="741">There was no reason for it.</sentence><sentence id="742">What were they going</sentence><sentence id="744">to do with sheets of metal?</sentence><sentence id="745">You know, there was no need for it any more.</sentence><sentence id="746">Uh...I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> coming in ... of course we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span>, we couldn't see anything and uh ... when they let us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, I remember terrible devastation in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="747">It really looked .. we were amazed, I mean we hadn't been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ... this was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was so destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="748">Uh ... and, I really think they didn't know what to do with us when they got us back.</sentence><sentence id="749">It was the kind of thing where somebody says, "what did you bring us here, where did you get these guys?</sentence><sentence id="750">What am I supposed to do with them?"</sentence><sentence id="751">That kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="752">You know.</sentence><sentence id="753">So uh .. for want of a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, they brought us to a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and they put all of us in two <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">Which was awful crowded and uh .. we had just nothing to do for probably .. they kept us there for I would say three or four weeks.</sentence><sentence id="755">We got very inadequate food, they did take us out a few times and the only thing we did when they took us out -- we were collecting shell fragments from the anti-aircraft guns that had fallen -- you know they were really jagged fragments.</sentence><sentence id="756">I don't know if you have ever seen an anti-aircraft shell -- they are jagged pieces of metal.</sentence><sentence id="757">You have to be careful when you pick them up because they are really sharp in some instances and we put them on, in Europe they use these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer trucks</span> that are open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span> in the back but we no longer had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> because they didn't have any gasoline so we had to pull the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="758">But again .. this was a nonsense job -- it was really not a job that meant anything because nothing was going anywhere -- nothing was functioning anymore.</sentence><sentence id="759">You know .. <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for all practical purposes, really had stopped functioning in those days.</sentence><sentence id="760">Uh .. I suppose, somewhere in the middle or towards the end of January, uh .. maybe the director of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> wanted to get rid of us and said " look, take these guys away, I don't want them here" or somebody said, "What do we do with these people?"</sentence><sentence id="761">So, they put us in two small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> probably for three months.</sentence><sentence id="819">On the day that I now know was April 15, 1945, we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> with stars on them coming through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> and uh .. that was the British army and uh .. the German guards were either -- the ones that hadn't melted away, I imagine a lot of them had run away -- were taken prisoner and the British came in and I guess they were pretty horrified by what they saw because they just couldn't cope with it.</sentence><sentence id="820">You know, this was an advancing army, they don't -- how could they have medical facilities for uh .. I believe the records indicate that there were 13,000 unburied dead were found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> 23,000 unburied dead were found in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> 13,000 were to die from the time that the British took over until they were finally able to bring sanitation and what have you into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">Uh... the British couldn't really do anything for us for the first couple of weeks -- they did bring us food but it was rich food that we really couldn't eat -- but at least we got water.</sentence><sentence id="822">There was no medical attention because how could you have enough doctors to take care of all these people.</sentence><sentence id="823">And again, it was probably fate or divine providence that I got better.</sentence><sentence id="824">And a number of us got better.</sentence><sentence id="825">We were then ... the British decided to burn .. oh, the British used the German guard to bury all the unburied dead.</sentence><sentence id="826">We saw that and it was sort of satisfaction to us, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="827">Uh ..they burned down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they thought that all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had been so polluted and so full of excrement and blood and whatever -- there was just no way to preserve it and they moved us into a nearby um .. what had been <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span>, in fact, when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> -- it is again a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="828">You know .. they were two story <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, it was a <span class="DLF">parade ground</span> and typical kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="829">And we were in there and that's when I would say -- I probably had a recuperation period of three to four months -- we got medical care.</sentence><sentence id="830">We got adequate ... we certainly got food.</sentence><sentence id="831">We were treated like human beings.</sentence><sentence id="832">And it's amazing how fast you snap back and start thinking in terms of enjoying your life.</sentence><sentence id="833">I had missed really all my childhood -- really missed all my teenage years.</sentence><sentence id="834">Those were the days when I first -- when I all of a sudden became interested in girls.</sentence><sentence id="835">You know after I got better and I guess the girls became interested in boys and we would talk and you know .. there would be the normal umm ... social ... intercourse between people where you would spend time</sentence><sentence id="837">together and enjoy each other's company.</sentence><sentence id="838">Uh .. one of the people who worked for the British Red Cross, a lady -- I spoke some English because I had taken English in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and probably spoke more than a passable English -- not really great but more than passable.</sentence><sentence id="839">She came into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> one day and said is there anyone here who speaks English and I said yeah, I speak English.</sentence><sentence id="840">So she needed, she was running a supply uh .. <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> .. the British call it a Supply Dump but it's really not a dump, it's a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="841">It was organized by the British Red Cross and order of St. John and I became an interpreter for her and later became attached to the British army as an interpreter and that's why I am wearing the uniform in these pictures.</sentence><sentence id="842">And amazingly enough, I kept in touch with this lady -- Mrs. Payton for all these years.</sentence><sentence id="843">She just passed away probably a year ago or two years ago.</sentence><sentence id="844">We would exchange Christmas gifts and letters and phone calls and she came to visit us once and what have you.</sentence><sentence id="845">And uh ..
