In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, it's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">And it was a uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> that has been around for something like two or three hundred years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: In what <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: In <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">And uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is exactly half way between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">And it used to be a very important <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">The way it was in uh <span class="REGION">Central Europe</span> that uh Jews were mostly in the <span class="REGION">rural areas</span>, and as the industrialization of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, of <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span>, took place uh more and more opportunities uh started uh (cough) bringing about uh opportunities outside the <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> and so gradually uh the real people with the guts would, leaved the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and go to bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">Some of them even would go <span class="NPIP">abroad</span> or to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="25">Q: Let's talk about Frank Meissner though, and Frank Meissner's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: Well, this was my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Tell us about uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span>?</sentence><sentence id="30">Tell us about your family first.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Well, in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was, has had a population of five thousand for years and years and years and it still does.</sentence><sentence id="34">And uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> from its highest uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has dwindled gradually from something like four hundred to about uh seventy hundred (ph) in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="35">And our family has always been one of the important families in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and has almost looked like uh generation after generation; and the Meissners would be uh presidents of the congregation.</sentence><sentence id="36">Three or four generations that I know of - it's almost as if uh some couldn't avoid this opportunity and uh my dad was a uh industrialist that uh had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for making uh shoes, wooden shoes.</sentence><sentence id="37">And then when uh leather shoes became uh the thing to do he had to close down the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and became in uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">So uh my mother and father worked full time in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I had a whatever you called it, German uh lady that would take care of me, and my brother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="39">I had a brother-in-law that was three years older by the name of Leo.</sentence><sentence id="40">So uh this lady uh took care of me till uh 1929.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: How old were you in 1929?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Well, I was born in 1923.</sentence><sentence id="52">I was six.</sentence><sentence id="53">I was just about ready to go to grade, uh to <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> and uh the <span class="BUILDING">furniture factory</span> went bust during the financial troubles.</sentence><sentence id="54">So uh we could no longer have uh anybody take care of me, and both my father and mother worked together.</sentence><sentence id="55">My mother worked as a uh secretary, working for my, for her brother that had a <span class="BUILDING">machine factory</span>, and Dad couldn't uh get himself a new job, and so he became what is now-a-days called a uh househusband, I presume.</sentence><sentence id="56">Which was at that time very unusual.</sentence><sentence id="57">And uh because of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was uh small we didn't have a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, so when I was uh ten or eleven I had to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which had a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">I would uh stay with a family during the weekend and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, uh during the week, and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during the weekend.</sentence><sentence id="59">And I wasn't a very good student.</sentence><sentence id="60">I was in fact a lousy student.</sentence><sentence id="61">I had problems all time and uh...with teachers and low grades and my father had to go to talk to the teachers to see what they could do and I never flunked completely...and just barely going from grade to grade.</sentence><sentence id="62">And at one point in 1930 ... "37, the decision was to be made whether I was going to go on to <span class="BUILDING">senior high school</span> and the decision was that I would said Dad.</sentence><sentence id="63">And I said and I wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="64">So he said you have to.</sentence><sentence id="65">So I said uh, I'll show you.</sentence><sentence id="66"><span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at that time uh if one went or flunked one subject in the curriculum, you had to go a whole year around and so I said I'll show you and within two or three months I flunked out of Latin.</sentence><sentence id="67">And that was in 1937.</sentence><sentence id="68">And at that time I uh, it has already has become fashionable to uh let smart kids, teenagers to learn something with their hands because chances were that one would leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">So I went to work as an apprentice in my uncle's uh <span class="BUILDING">machine factory</span> and uh then this uh possibility came about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Can we hold it for a minute?</sentence><sentence id="91">Because this is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span>, I think, to ask about what it was like as a Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">What was it like growing up as a Jew, particularly since your family was as prominent as it was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: Obviously in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like this uh you uh couldn't uh get away from being Jew, because everybody knew everybody else, whereas in bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> you could uh go pass by.</sentence><sentence id="97">So obviously in uh <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> I got beaten up and had all sorts of problems because I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="98">And uh we uh lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and by that time uh the congregation was so small that we had to have uh mobilized everybody for the _-- group every morning.</sentence><sentence id="99">So uh I was mobilized and of course getting up at six o'clock in the morning was not exactly what particularly I was interested in.</sentence><sentence id="100">But my grandfather, my mother's father, used to live with us.</sentence><sentence id="101">He was a widower, a guy with lots of uh sense of humor and so he made it easier for me to make it easier to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="102">But five crowns (ph) a week kind of on the side - that was at that time quite a bit of money.</sentence><sentence id="103">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Was your family very religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: Well, I mean at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> had mostly religious.</sentence><sentence id="115">There was nothing in these uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">There was nothing except uh highly kosher and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="117">Uh and obviously being a kid of my father who was the congregation president, we had to at least show that we behaved properly.</sentence><sentence id="118">And uh the congregation was very small and very together.</sentence><sentence id="119">And uh since most of the people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> already had been the first generation that have left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and for instance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, there was a it is called, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trest</span> which had at that time more Jews, two hundred, than the city of the origin.</sentence><sentence id="120">Just like uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">USS</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">has more Irish than Irish has in its uh state.</sentence><sentence id="122">And so people were always very loyal to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they came from and in my, since my dad was president of the congregation, all of them would come and visit.</sentence><sentence id="123">And he also would be uh paying out uh I don't know what it is called - uh there was a great deal of loyalty to the uh young and old poor people that came from the <span class="REGION">eastern provinces</span> and my dad had to help them, so we uh had quite a bit of both the western and eastern uh Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="124">By uh by our standards we were already the western Jews and there was always quite a bit of looking down on the eastern - the same thing that happened between the German in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the Russian - I mean every major congregation in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> had these frictions.</sentence><sentence id="125">So that's uh basically the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="139">So as a young man then, you decided that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was not for you.</sentence><sentence id="140">You flunked Latin.</sentence><sentence id="141">Uh and you became an apprentice.</sentence><sentence id="142">Tell us about being an apprentice with and what was it like"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Well, in - I was an apprentice in the lathe, uh metal lathe uh proposition and ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: I don't understand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Lathe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Oh, a lathe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: And uh at that time the apprentices of course were taking care of everybody else and with coffee and what have you and cleaning the uh <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> on Saturday afternoons.</sentence><sentence id="157">So one didn't learn a hell of a lot.</sentence><sentence id="158">But there was one week in uh uh when one went to a uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that by law one has to go and he taught all sorts of uh drafting and kind of a uh vocational proposition so that was nice.</sentence><sentence id="159">On Thursdays one could be away from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and uh learn something.</sentence><sentence id="160">Uh the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> had uh produced manufacture of equipment for uh <span class="BUILDING">bakeries</span> and uh meat proposition - that was a very specialized <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">And the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> still exists.</sentence><sentence id="162">No longer in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machinery</span> but now they make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">agriculture machinery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">And last time we were there in Christmas it was a terrible mess.</sentence><sentence id="164">But, one at least saw that it existed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="175">So you were an apprentice, and what did you do next?</sentence><sentence id="176">What did you decide to do at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well, then this uh opportunity came up with the so I went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for a little . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: Back up.</sentence><sentence id="183">Tell us what a <span class="BUILDING">HaSharah</span> (ph) was in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and how it worked.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Was there a large group of young Zionists in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: Well there were maybe thirty or forty of them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="197">Q: Can you describe what you did as a group, ..... Zionists ...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Well it was just like uh like uh a youth group would.</sentence><sentence id="200">And uh would go out on Saturdays and Sundays, and going out in to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And uh I learned uh Hebrew and knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">My dad was a very uh important Zionist, so it came natural.</sentence><sentence id="203">Except uh I was the only one that did something about it.</sentence><sentence id="204">My uh uh mother had uh, we had several opportunities to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> but my mother just couldn't to get away uh from the the whole family and in uh - well, it was this way.</sentence><sentence id="205">I mean it was a major decision just like any other decision that uh American Jews that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> - some of them took and some of them didn't take an opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="206">And my mother has uh always going to the uh going to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">Very important.</sentence><sentence id="208">And when it came down to the uh major decision it was always she couldn't get away from the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">And my brother-in-law (ph) was a electric engineer and in 1938 he was a real good boy, always a good boy.</sentence><sentence id="210">That was one of my problems that I, my dad always said why can't you be uh like your brother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="211">I told him very simple, because I am not my brother.</sentence><sentence id="212">But he was, uh he got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anssuan</span> in electricity in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> under the English and uh he could have gotten a good job and good uh salary and mother would never had anything with it.</sentence><sentence id="213">I mean they just said impossible to be that way, that long away from us.</sentence><sentence id="214">And my brother-in-law was the good boy so he stayed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: My brother, my brother, right.</sentence><sentence id="234">He was three years older.</sentence><sentence id="235">And so he didn't take the opportunity uh opportunity and uh eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="236">So there were always opportunities to get away in time which was not taken, opportunity was not utilized.</sentence><sentence id="237">I was the only one because I was the bad boy and uh I couldn't care less what my parents said.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="BUILDING">agriculture school</span> they had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and so I became the guy to take care of uh the hogs and the cows.</sentence><sentence id="416">It was of the few

said what do I do now.</sentence><sentence id="431">So he uh made a couple phone calls and said uh everything is fine.</sentence><sentence id="432">Take your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>,
