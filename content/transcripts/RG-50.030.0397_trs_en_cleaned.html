<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you born in, and that you grew up in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="53">There were 31,000 Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bendezin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">Of course there's not a trace of them today in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Life was very interesting and families were extremely close.</sentence><sentence id="56">My grandfather lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">Life was not abundant in riche -- riches, but somehow we -- we felt that we are destined to play an important role in the life of humankind, that we have given the world the 10 commandments, not in order to achieve power, but to set moral examples.</sentence><sentence id="58">To set standards of how to deal, how men should deal with God, how men should deal with -- with man.</sentence><sentence id="59">I went, as a youngster to a <span class="BUILDING">religious</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Zionist school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">I stayed there for about four years and then my parents transferred me into a secular [indecipherable] school.</sentence><sentence id="61">I remember Friday -- Fridays very well.</sentence><sentence id="62">My mother wil -- getting up very early, going to buy [indecipherable] chicken.</sentence><sentence id="63">And there was excitement of a Friday.</sentence><sentence id="64">Saturday morning I used to go with my grandfather, and sometimes with my father to pray.</sentence><sentence id="65">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on Saturday was completely engulfed in silence.</sentence><sentence id="66">You see only Jewish people marching to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, quietly.</sentence><sentence id="67">The prayers were -- were [indecipherable] and you felt some sacredness in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">I loved those Fridays and I loved those Saturdays.</sentence><sentence id="69">Furthermore, I remember that Jews from its -- Jews from surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in order to buy chicken, fish and bring them into the shochet, the ritual slaughterer.</sentence><sentence id="70">They were -- they were buying all -- always for the whole week and then came the next Friday again.</sentence><sentence id="71">I was extremely happy in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, learning about Zionism, learning about -- about Jewish religion, and developing an extremely fond love for the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="72">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- the cultural life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was on a very high level.</sentence><sentence id="73">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theater</span>, there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish newspaper</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">There was a voluntary symphony orchestra.</sentence><sentence id="75">There was a -- was a big <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">And there were <span class="BUILDING">sports clubs</span>, and we always were trying to participate in the sport events.</sentence><sentence id="79">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>, however, was divided.</sentence><sentence id="80">There were people who belonged to a very radical Zionist movement, the Zhabotinsky movement.</sentence><sentence id="81">And there were again [indecipherable] especially where some of my friends belonged to a socialist Zionist movement.</sentence><sentence id="82">And in the middle there was the mean, mean Zionist.</sentence><sentence id="83">People who did not try to define themselves as -- as right wingers or left wingers.</sentence><sentence id="84">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orthodox community</span> was also divided.</sentence><sentence id="85">There were strictly Orthodox groups, and then there were groups that did not only believe that prayer is the answer to our problems, but forming or creating, or returning to our ancient homeland is extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="86">My two sisters belonged to that general Zionist organization, and I, as a young man, felt that perhaps the Zortinsky movement, the movement that was teaching us to go and move to it -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and fight, I felt at that time that this is the only solution.</sentence><sentence id="87">In my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I did not feel any anti-Semitism when I grew up, because there were not too many Gentiles in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and there was no contact whatsoever between the Jewish community and the Christian community.</sentence><sentence id="88">We lived separate -- separate lives, not mingling with each other.</sentence><sentence id="89">I remember my teachers were -- who I liked very, very much, they really cared.</sentence><sentence id="90">I remember my uncles, merchants and [indecipherable], aunts that - - more pious than their husbands.</sentence><sentence id="91"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> friends who were bookworms, and others who really didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="92">But the discussions among all those groups were very heated.</sentence><sentence id="93">We really believed in our cause, and tried to convince those others to join us.</sentence><sentence id="94">We did not have any luck.</sentence><sentence id="95">They were also convinced in their just cause.</sentence><sentence id="96">There was a communist movement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">Their aim was to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>, create a state there.</sentence><sentence id="98">I remember the name of the state that they were trying to -- to establish, they call it Biro Bijam.</sentence><sentence id="99">Someplace in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">I did not meet any of them after the war, and I don't believe that some of them survived in the Soviet Union.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: About what?</sentence></p></dialogue>

[</sentence><sentence id="167">indecipherable] organization, and most of the people, please understand, were my age.</sentence><sentence id="168">Older people did not belong to those <span class="BUILDING">organizations</span>, to those radical organizations.</sentence><sentence id="169">Most of them were part of the general Zionist movement.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: What did it mean to be a member, and how -- how did you get together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: We were getting together sometimes in the evenings, but mostly Saturdays afternoon, discussing events in the Jewish world, expressing our opinion, and participating in all events that were taking place in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, whenever somebody came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to speak to us.</sentence><sentence id="173">Those were really wonderful years, really wonderful years.</sentence><sentence id="174">My two sisters did belong to the general Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="175">And I'm not sure that I remember, but it seems to me that m-mostly -- my organization, there were mostly men.</sentence><sentence id="176">I don't remember any women in my organization.</sentence><sentence id="177">But in the general Zionist organization, there were a lot of women.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: Can you tell us the names of your sisters?</sentence><sentence id="185">I don't believe you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: My older sister's name was Esther.</sentence><sentence id="187">My younger sister's name was Rushka.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: And at this point when you were in this youth group, or this group, now how old are you?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Did your parents have opinions about the group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: No, my parents belonged to the general Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="200">This is perhaps one of the reasons that my sis -- two sisters joined that organization.</sentence><sentence id="201">They felt more comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="202">It may be also that most of their friends belonged to that same organization.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: Did anyone in the family have a strong reaction to the fact that you were in a separate group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="209">What -- what, for instance, did your father or your mother say about that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="210">A: My father and my mother were very tolerant people, and they felt that if this is what I would like to do, this is the organization that I would like to belong to, they will not interfere.</sentence><sentence id="211">They will not interfere, as long as it is a Zionist organization.</sentence><sentence id="212">Did my uncles, who were very pious people object to it?</sentence><sentence id="213">I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="214">I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="215">They actually also belong to -- to radical Zionist organizations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: What were the goals of the group that you were part of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: The goal was, first of all, as long as we cannot move to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, to develop a strong sense of Jewish identity, reinforcing the feelings that we had in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, reinforcing it in such a way that -- that we were more free to discuss things.</sentence><sentence id="225">And I don't [indecipherable] discussing events and problems that are taking place not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="226">We used to get newspapers, discuss articles, have -- have opinions.</sentence><sentence id="227">And all of it was very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="228">We were looking forward to those meetings, sometimes in the evening, but most of the time on Saturdays afternoon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: How did -- how do you make sense of a kind of -- th-the fact that you went your separate way from the family, and that you were very passionate?</sentence><sentence id="235">How do you explain that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: Iwas young, and I was concerned with the rest of -- the rest of -- with the members of [indecipherable] who felt that -- especially the older [indecipherable] that felt that we should not hasten the arrival of the Messiah, that we have no right to do things like this.</sentence><sentence id="239">I was resentful of it.</sentence><sentence id="242">And I strongly believed that only power will force the English people to let us come in.</sentence><sentence id="243">Only our determination and our willingness to fight and not wait for the goodwill of the English government, is the only solution.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Did you imagine yourself perhaps, getting smuggled in there and becoming a -- a military --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: Ye -- yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="253">I know that some of my friends who still live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> came in 1936 or 1937 as illegal immigrants, being brought into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in a very clandestine way.</sentence><sentence id="254">I'm asking myself why didn't I go.</sentence><sentence id="255">It's a very painful question.</sentence><sentence id="256">Perhaps even though I felt that this is the only way, and to feel that way, you have to have courage.</sentence><sentence id="257">Could be that I did not have the courage to go along with, being 17 or 18 years old and start a life on my own.</sentence><sentence id="258">My family was a very close family, and I never developed a feeling that I can be alone.</sentence><sentence id="259">And that prevented me from making that fateful decision.</sentence><sentence id="260">In hindsight of course, I would have been much better off, and perhaps that bothers me, and perhaps convince my two sisters after I will be there, that they should do the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="261">It bothers me.</sentence><sentence id="262">On the other hand I have doubts that my sisters would leave our parents alone.</sentence><sentence id="263">They were not young any more, and I am not sure that they would have accept this idea of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and abandoning -- I'm using that word because this is the way they felt probably, abandoning our parents.</sentence><sentence id="264">My two sisters, if we can go to a different topic, joined me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> when I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in 19 - nine -- 1936.</sentence><sentence id="265">In 1937 they joined me.</sentence><sentence id="266">I was transferring to the <span class="BUILDING">business academy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> only to be able to get into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">But the quota was very low and I didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="269">I transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">business academy</span> and my si -- two sisters came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to study.</sentence><sentence id="270">But at the same time, I'm not proud of myself, I'm proud of my youngest sister.</sentence><sentence id="271">We made a deal, all three of us, that every Friday one of us would go and spend the -- the weekend of the Shabbat with our parents.</sentence><sentence id="272">My youngest sister never failed to go.</sentence><sentence id="273">I had sometimes a -- an event that I wanted to attend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, sports event</sentence></p></dialogue>
