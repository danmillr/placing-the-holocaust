<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: My identity?</sentence><sentence id="47">Only American.</sentence><sentence id="48">Because I've lived -- I would say -- I'm 78, so if I'm here since 1953, I've spent the greater part of my life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I've lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">And I couldn't immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I was on the German quota, so I went on my Dutch passport, as an immigrant to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">And within nine months, the time it takes to get a baby, I had a visa to come in as an immigrant, because I hired a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">And the moment | hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, I got an immigration lawyer, who got me nine months later, on an immigration visa to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, because I had met my second husband and I was chasing him.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hm</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: The or -- the identity thing.</sentence><sentence id="143">Your parents -- as I recall, you said in the first</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="146">interview, were Jewish, but cultural or secular Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Not only cultural, but my father -- my father was a physician, had studied Renata Laqueur 6 February 7, 1998 raised Jewish, they had never been in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">The grandparents already, their parents were trying to assimilate.</sentence><sentence id="149">It was the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dreyfus</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">It was the time when a boy couldn't get into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> if he was Jewish and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="151">So they got baptized I think, when they were very young, they were cousins.</sentence><sentence id="152">I think they were either 18 or 19.</sentence><sentence id="153">And so, no Jewish religion at all.</sentence><sentence id="154">And then comes Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="155">And then, he's in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he's professor of medicine, pharmacology, st -- and MD, PhD and the immigrants are coming and he helps them and these were Jews who were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="156">Whether they were religious or not, they were marked as Jews and had to be helped.</sentence><sentence id="157">I have never, ever forgiven my father, it's also in my book, that in 1941, when the Germans came with this kind of ... ordering people to fill in forms where they had to put in whether they had one or two or three or four Jewish grandparents, he was so fucking German, that he filled in four.</sentence><sentence id="158">He could have gotten by with filling in none or one and he would have gotten by and I've never forgiven him for that.</sentence><sentence id="159">Because this was again the -- what do you call this?</sentence><sentence id="160">Buckling under, because of the army, the militaries, my father was an officer in the German army in the first World War.</sentence><sentence id="161">This is all, incidentally, in the g -- book of my dissertation in German.</sentence><sentence id="162">The editor has written a t -- an, what do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="163">Introduction, in which he" explained what my background is and my struggle with being German by ... let's say, by genes.</sentence><sentence id="164">But not in feeling.</sentence><sentence id="165">And my father -- let me give you the story, because this is -- all had -- all to do with later on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">My father is born in a -- in 1880.</sentence><sentence id="167">He marries in 1905, his cousin.</sentence><sentence id="168">They marry in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they are both baptized.</sentence><sentence id="169">He is finished with medica -- <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">She has no profession.</sentence><sentence id="171">They marry in 1905, in 1912 he is called by the <span class="BUILDING">University of Groningen</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, to Renata Laqueur 7 February 7, 1998 come as an assistant professor, because he had made his name in pharmacology.</sentence><sentence id="172">He is, incidentally, the guy who later on, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, in his <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span>, did develop testosterone.</sentence><sentence id="173">So he became a very famous pharmacologist and physician and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="174">So 1912 he goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Groningen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">My three older brothers and sisters are born already.</sentence><sentence id="176">1912 I'm not born yet.</sentence><sentence id="177">No, 19 f -- two were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the third one was also not born -- was 148.</sentence><sentence id="178">1912, he's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Groningen</span>, he's very happy, they have moved their two children and his wife and he is in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">The war breaks out, 1914, he volunteers -- that you should tay?</sentence><sentence id="180">to a Dutch child -- he volunteers to go into the army as a medical officer.</sentence><sentence id="181">So he goes into the ROTC, whatever it is in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and what do they do?</sentence><sentence id="182">They stick him, because he's a pharmacologist, he's the -- in the -- occupying German army of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">He works with the gas, with the -- what we call today, the Saddam Hussein kick ass!deg, because as a pharmacologist, they develop...nitrogen, mustard, you name it.</sentence><sentence id="184">Later on I come across that again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sloan-Kettering</span> in "53, because the first chemo is a mustard thing.</sentence><sentence id="185">Anyway -- and the result of this is, although he never, ever worked on arms, that the Belgians say you get capital punishment if you ever come to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> after the war.</sentence><sentence id="186">This means that we lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> already, because in nine -- let me -- I'm jumping.</sentence><sentence id="187">1914 is in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> for -- I don't know whether it was "16 or "17, I -- that I don't know. "</sentence><sentence id="188">18 the war is over, 1919 the Dutch want him back.</sentence><sentence id="189">And this time they want him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and they give him a professorship, a full chair pharmacology, MD, whatever and a <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">So he goes.</sentence><sentence id="191">He packs up -- by then his four children, Renata has been born.</sentence><sentence id="192">Lilo comes later, she's born in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">And - Renata Laqueur 8 February 7, 1998 - why am I telling you this?</sentence><sentence id="194">And then in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, he -- is still 1932"!,</sentence><sentence id="195">he is a German citizen.</sentence><sentence id="196">In 1933 he becomes a Dutch citizen, with his children becoming Dutch because he wanted!",</sentence><sentence id="197">he makes his money, he's there, the children are Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="198">It had nothing to do with Hitler, it was just before.</sentence><sentence id="199">And we become Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="200">But I was always second generation.</sentence><sentence id="201">So this may be also, just as I'm talking to you, why somewhere I'm more American, because this is -- was my free choice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: You -- on the ph -- when we spoke on the phone a while back, you said that you weren't Jewish enough for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="260">A: I'm not Jewish enough for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in that sense, that I cannot even ask whether they, let's say, give me any sponsorship of any of the really Orthodox, or purely Jewish organizations, the U.G.A." or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="269">If I feel anything -- and that it -- religion, and this is interesting because it comes out when I'm very sick or when there is major disaster, I pray and I was raised also in a Dutch reformed school environment, so I am basically Calvinist, but I've had Catholic boyfriends, Jewish boyfriends, so that's -- but I feel very, very, very un-Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Do you have any spiritual practice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Any spiritual what?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Have you ever read the Bible?</sentence><sentence id="299">Old Testament?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Oh yeah, I have read the Bible and the Bible, but I read the Bible more as literature.</sentence><sentence id="303">And as a cultural background, just as you -- you -- you read whatever, you know, in Liberal Arts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: Y-You said that when you -- when you pray, it's -- it's to manipulate?</sentence><sentence id="307">Those were your words?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: I never thought of this, but I just said it.</sentence><sentence id="311">I don't know, you see that's a good question, why do I pray?</sentence><sentence id="312">Do I -- I pray of a mixture of guilt from I have to thank Him or I have to be angry or I have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="313">I definitely pray when I'm in <span class="NPIP">trouble</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">But I also pray when I'm very happy.</sentence><sentence id="315">In between I forget.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="331">Thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: The coffee? ...</sentence><sentence id="335">What we are talking about is to my mind, cultural history.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: So I -- I want to get back to this Jewish thing for just a little bit, because so much of what happened to you, or everything that happened to you was predicated on your being Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="342">Renata Laqueur 10 February 7, 1998</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: You mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="344">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="345">On the other hand, I'm not sure at all, I might have ended up in the same concen -- or in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> if I would have been plain Dutch and working in the -- what is it -- resistance.</sentence><sentence id="346">I don't know anybody who did not not work in the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="347">It's very interesting, the people of my <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> class, of my let's say, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> class, out of 22, 10 died -- but a percentage and this was a non-Jewish school, which means they didn't come back.</sentence><sentence id="348">D-Don't forget we had the Japanese occupation and the German occupation.</sentence><sentence id="349">At least three of, or four of my classmates were in Japanese prisoner of war, men or women.</sentence><sentence id="350">The other ones were either picked up because they were in the resistance -- and one other one was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="351">So you see, the percentage in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is unbelievable, because it's not comparable to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">Because Bel- Belgium had a...military command, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was somehow not very serious either.</sentence><sentence id="353">We had one of the very worst Nazis, Himmler-like Seyss-Inquart!</sentence><sentence id="354">&gt;, who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and in many ways the Austrians were worse.</sentence><sentence id="355">So that was <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> had -- the percentage of people dying is enormous.</sentence><sentence id="357">And when you say the Jewishness has something to do with it, I'm not at all convinced of that.</sentence><sentence id="358">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, yes, but either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> or one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">female camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> -- I read up on all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> because of my diary preoccupation in the dissertation.</sentence><sentence id="359">So the Jewishness -- and on the other hand, I also feel this has been a problem after the war was over -- that it didn't bring me closer to the whole Jewish problem.</sentence><sentence id="360">Because it would be naturally that I would say okay, they persecuted me, I didn't feel really part of it, but now I want to be part of it.</sentence><sentence id="361">| moved away from it.</sentence><sentence id="362">The more -- I thought about it before you came here and I thought if I add up who are my friends Renata Laqueur 11 February 7, 1998 today and sociologically or that is -- yeah, sociologic -- where are they from?If you take 10 people, there are at least seven who are not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="363">And this is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">A kind of, an almost -- to me it's not conscious, it's subconscious, but I avoid it carefully -- on a -- I don't know on what level, I can't -- can't even explain it.</sentence><sentence id="365">It has to do with friends, with relationships with men, friendships with women and it -- the really deepest involvements were with non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="366">Both husbands, the first husband was baptized, is today Paul, lives in Germany"(r).</sentence><sentence id="367">He married a woman who was 35 years younger.</sentence><sentence id="368">That is his third marriage and the second one was Dutch nobility.</sentence><sentence id="369">He had four children with her, the third one is 35 years younger, dee!"</sentence><sentence id="370">wasn't even born yet!(r).</sentence><sentence id="371">He's 84 and we are corresponding, we see each other each time when I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we still love each other.</sentence><sentence id="372">We're friends.</sentence><sentence id="373">But he also has veered away from anything which is Jewish -- was fully Jewish born, parents were not even baptized.</sentence><sentence id="374">But you either go with or you do totally without.</sentence><sentence id="375">I have never realized it until now, when I get such interviews that I think.</sentence><sentence id="376">I said, "How does it tally up?"</sentence><sentence id="377">And I figured it out last night.</sentence><sentence id="378">Never thought about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
