class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and then he thought of a very clever way to foil the French.</sentence><sentence id="292">When he got to the border- -the "<span class="DLF">border</span>" in the sense of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupied zone</span>--and, of course, at that time the Petain regime USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 7 was cooperating with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="293">Although they were all French patrolling, they were all cooperating with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="294">And he thought [to] himself, "There is only one way to foil the

he kept on eating non-stop.</sentence><sentence id="299">He wasn't do diddling or daddling.</sentence><sentence id="300">He was eating.</sentence><sentence id="301">And he ate for several hours, and nobody touched him.</sentence><sentence id="302">And he made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">And when he made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>, he had a gold cigarette case that he went to pawn to get some money.</sentence><sentence id="304">And he got that money, and was able to help Gerta in case she needed passage.</sentence><sentence id="305">And then he went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban Consulate</span> and said he needs another visa.</sentence><sentence id="306">And the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> denied.</sentence><sentence id="307">He says, "Impossible!</sentence><sentence id="308">Impossible!</sentence><sentence id="309">I am already in hot water for having given you all this.</sentence><sentence id="310">Impossible!</sentence><sentence id="311">I have given away too many.</sentence><sentence id="312">I cannot give another person."</sentence><sentence id="313">My father was not dis...easily to be dissuaded; and he persisted and persisted, and, of course, they got nowhere for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="314">And finally the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban Consulate</span> said, "You know, there is an old law on the books that when you're given your visa, you can take all your possessions with you.</sentence><sentence id="315">Now, the old law says that slaves are a possession of the owner.</sentence><sentence id="316">Would you say that this lady is...woman is your slave?"</sentence><sentence id="317">And my father quickly said, "Yes.</sentence><sentence id="318">She is my slave and my possession, and she needs to come with me."</sentence><sentence id="319">And on that basis, Gerta got the grant...visa to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">But she did not have a pass to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, and that was too dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="321">He somehow arranged for her to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">All of this was extremely complicated and extremely difficult to do.</sentence><sentence id="323">My father was really very ingenious.</sentence><sentence id="324">Uh, and somehow, again, he got himself back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> through the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="325">Apparently, on the way back there was not such a long border stop.</sentence><sentence id="326">But the big crisis was on one way.</sentence><sentence id="327">He had...he did have his visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> on...to show that he could get out.</sentence><sentence id="328">So on the way back, it wasn't quite as difficult for him as rationale for going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">We sailed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Portugese ship</span>, the _(ph), from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> in the beginning of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="330">Uh, I remember stopping in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> to an impression I will never forget.</sentence><sentence id="331">The dazzling sun, the enormous amount of sand, women were all veiled, long robes for men.</sentence><sentence id="332">I thought this was some storybook.</sentence><sentence id="333">I had no idea what was happening and where we were.</sentence><sentence id="334">I was absolutely stunned at this image.</sentence><sentence id="335">Uh, we were not...we did not get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerta</span> got on.</sentence><sentence id="337">And that was a very emotional reunion.</sentence><sentence id="338">Then we proceeded across the Atlantic with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> full of refugees.</sentence><sentence id="339">My dear father provided for his family.</sentence><sentence id="340">We had a first class <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> all to ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="341">Before leaving Europe, my...one of the things my father had arranged for, while he was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, is to have all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> stored someplace safely in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="342">And so he had it stored in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">And the reason was not so much the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>--although it was quite elegant <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Queen Anne furniture</span> which my parent...father had set up this very lovely <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the Rue de Messine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when we had lived there.</sentence><sentence id="344">But the thing that was critical in that...in...in...in that box that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> [was in] were my grandfather's paintings.</sentence><sentence id="345">There were three of them...three paintings in there, which my father managed to store in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>, and which we recuperated after the war and after we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">The three paintings are, one, a self portrait of my grandfather, who looks like Toulouse-Lautrec--big black hat, big fur coat, very distinguished looking.</sentence><sentence id="347">A picture...painting of his father-in-law, [ (ph)], in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="348">The light shining on him looks like that picture would come alive.</sentence><sentence id="349">I think that was the one that they wanted for the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">And a third picture, of a painting of a poor man who used to not always have enough food that my grandmother used to offer a USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 8 cup of tea.</sentence><sentence id="351">She'd offer him some borscht or some tea, and would feed him.</sentence><sentence id="352">And so that's the portrait, the third painting that we have.</sentence><sentence id="353">My Aunt Masha brought two other paintings too.</sentence><sentence id="354">Uh, one is a magnificent...uh...paysage [Fr: "landscape"]--a scene of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, the Berioshkas in snow.</sentence><sentence id="355">And another is uh a scene of a...one of their brothers studying for Bar Mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="356">So those are the five paintings that we now have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">Anyway, we went on to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>...it took 3 and a half weeks to cross the Atlantic through a very circuitous route--to the very south, because we needed to avoid the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war zones</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">Uh, we went far south, I believe, to cross and landed up first in <span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span>, which was again a very interesting uh sight for me.</sentence><sentence id="360">The...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, the climate, the people carrying baskets on their heads.</sentence><sentence id="361">I remember little things like that.</sentence><sentence id="362">Anyway, we went on to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">This entire <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> full of refugees, the entire hull of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, the basement people sleeping on the <span

(Sigh) We got off on <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> and were put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Tiscornia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">Uh, they didn't quite know what to do with us either.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="871">Q: At what point did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="873">A: Uh, as soon as we got a visa. (</sentence><sentence id="874">Laughter) My father wanted us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="875">He did not want us to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> forever, uh because...for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="876">He did not want us to marry Catholics, and he did not want us to lead the lives of the Cuban housewife--which invariably meant staying at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> while husbands had mistresses.</sentence><sentence id="877">And he realized that was...did not correspond to his value system-- or my mother's, for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="878">So it was again a matter of trying to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">After the war, of course, my parents being Latvian, they were...from citizens from behind the <span class="DLF">Iron Curtain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">And it was very difficult to get another Lat...American visa.</sentence><sentence id="881">But we did come... eventually get the visa.</sentence><sentence id="882">Uh, and we uh...got the immigration visa in 1948, which meant that we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and immigrated.</sentence><sentence id="883">But we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> to live.</sentence><sentence id="884">You don't have to stay here as an immigrant.</sentence><sentence id="885">I...You know, once you immigrate, you don't...that doesn't stop you from travelling.</sentence><sentence id="886">So we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> still for a year or so, then came back and eventually settled here.</sentence><sentence id="887">Uh, my sister and I were both teenagers at the time.</sentence><sentence id="888">I spent only two years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and was very miserable.</sentence><sentence id="889">Uh, I was really not geared to be a New York teenager.</sentence><sentence id="890">I wore pigtails and bobby socks, uh no make-up.</sentence><sentence id="891">I was really, uh as some of my friends said, "square."</sentence><sentence id="892">Uh, I was very unhappy in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="893">Big <span

id="895">I eventually found my niche in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> when I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="896">I found I had very good scholastic background from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="897">As I said, I only spent two years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="898">I was able to, you know, finish my USHMM Archives RG-50.030*230 10 language study and I had good history background and I spoke English with a British accent- -which, by the way, landed me the privilege of landing up in a foreign accent speech class in the New York City high school, to get rid of my foreign accent.</sentence><sentence id="899">And there I found myself with all the Puerto Rican children, and we just had a wonderful time talking Spanish.</sentence><sentence id="900">In any case, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Barnard College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="901">Uh, my father preferred that I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnard</span> rather than to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radcliffe</span>, so that I would still be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="902">He was still commuting to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="903">His business was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>.</sentence><sentence id="904">He had met a friend of his who survived the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="905">A high...a childhood friend, who came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the numbers and everything.</sentence><sentence id="906">And he said to Charlie Salkin (ph), was his name, "Charlie, why don't you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>, run the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="907">And I will do the export and the business end of it from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>."</sentence><sentence id="908">And so they did that.</sentence><sentence id="909">My father spent a lot of time commuting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>, which is why he had hoped that I would stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="910">I didn't think I would like Barnard, but really began to find my <span class="DLF">niche</span> there and really enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="911">I majored in chemistry and did graduate in biochemistry.</sentence><sentence id="912">Uh, my father's business eventually collapsed in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span>.</sentence><sentence id="913">As you well know, the events in <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> led to Castro, eventually.</sentence><sentence id="914">And my poor father lost his <span class="BUILDING">business</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="915">And by that time, he was older.</sentence><sentence id="916">And his friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, everyone, was very worried about how he was going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="917">My father was the eternal optimist.</sentence><sentence id="918">He always said, "I have survived Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="919">I will survive Castro."</sentence><sentence id="920">And he did.</sentence><sentence id="921">He did.</sentence><sentence id="922">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and his <span class="BUILDING">business</span> was taken from him.</sentence><sentence id="923">Charlie eventually immigrated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> himself.</sentence><sentence id="924">And his <span class="BUILDING">business</span> apparently was sold to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and eventually collapsed because they couldn't run it.</sentence><sentence id="925">They didn't have spare parts.</sentence><sentence id="926">So as far as we know, it's dead.</sentence><sentence id="927">Uh, I met my husband in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="928">Uh, my husband is born American.</sentence><sentence id="929">His name is Earl.</sentence><sentence id="930">He is a mathematician.</sentence><sentence id="931">He has a Ph.D. from <span
