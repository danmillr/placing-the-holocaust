<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What is your sister's name, and when was she born?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Tell me a little bit about your parents, how -- and also how far back the family goes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="42">Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you would call it.</sentence><sentence id="43">Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">Grandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the Hapsburg empire in what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, I guess, and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> as a very young man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture.</sentence><sentence id="45">That was the thing to do for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="46">It was, of course, the cultural center, right after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">He had a very interesting gold and silver -- he was a gold and silversmith in a ta -- in a stre -- on a <span class="DLF">street</span> that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather -- rather very Viennese, you know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in "The Magic Flute."</sentence><sentence id="48">And a very interesting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an artist he was, and in -- in eight -- in 1981, when the <span class="BUILDING">Metropolitan Museum</span> had a beautiful exp -- exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and -- and costumes, we suddenly stood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa -- it said</sentence><sentence id="50">circa 1872.</sentence><sentence id="51">So my sister and I just -- just -- just couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="52">I mean, this was just an unbelievable thing.</sentence><sentence id="53">We traced it down and it is now the property of the <span class="BUILDING">Imperial Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">And to try to get hold of somebody who knew something about it was -- this was 1981, I said, was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="55">So I'm still trying to figure out how I could see it one more time.</sentence><sentence id="56">But this was a -- a beautiful thing.</sentence><sentence id="57">Also, he has a --a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">So unbeknownst to us when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, he was apparently quite -- quite an artist.</sentence><sentence id="59">The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of my father's, but I don't really know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="60">It doesn't exist any more.</sentence><sentence id="61">The other grandfather also came from somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, as a very young man, about 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="62">And he turned out to be a very well-known businessman.</sentence><sentence id="63">He had the most -- best known haberdashery, I guess you would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called <span class="DLF">Karntner Strasse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">And once or twice a year he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for buying materials and -- and -- and for made-to-order suits for men and women.</sentence><sentence id="65">It was called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English fleet</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Englisch-Flotte</span>, it was very well known, and it was, until about 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi-- much younger than my mother's child, but that's a long family story that I don't think I have time to relate.</sentence><sentence id="66">Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous.</sentence><sentence id="67">My father's family had --</sentence><sentence id="69">there were two sisters and five brothers, seven.</sentence><sentence id="70">And my father, Oscar Politzer was the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="71">My mother's family, there were two older sisters and one younger brother.</sentence><sentence id="72">My mother's name was Marie, but she was all -- always Mitzi, little Mitzi because she was tiny and very, very delicate.</sentence><sentence id="73">And all she really knew how to do was play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">That was the thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="75">And both <span class="BUILDING">households</span> had a cook and a maid, and in my mother's family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="76">And my father's family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another -- another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these -- by this big family.</sentence><sentence id="77">I -- I think this is important to -- to realize how very much entrenched this -- both families were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">They were socially and financially very, very much Viennese.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: And what kind of work did your father do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: My father was, I guess you'd call it a businessman.</sentence><sentence id="122">He was supposed to -- to, with his brother-in-law, my mother's brother, take over the business from my maternal grandfather, but things happened.</sentence><sentence id="123">Grandpa Berger was his name, was widowed er -- er -- ma -- at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to the great distress of the children.</sentence><sentence id="124">And they had another child, and that other child, of course, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was</sentence><sentence id="126">that.</sentence><sentence id="127">So my father had -- it's hard to -- to translate it.</sentence><sentence id="128">He -- he represented <span class="BUILDING">foreign firms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">He was a businessman, and business was not good.</sentence><sentence id="130">We're talking -- my parents were married in 1914, beginning of the war.</sentence><sentence id="131">And the time between the wars was economically very bad in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="132">So we had everything a child would need.</sentence><sentence id="133">And besides, you didn't talk business with your children.</sentence><sentence id="134">I was really not aware of what my father did.</sentence><sentence id="135">I wouldn't say I didn't care, but you just didn't discuss it with your children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: Did your mother work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: No, Mother did not work, and it's -- it's interesting, because she was a very, very talented and very smart woman, but girls of this age in that level of society just didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="155">There was -- she played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> very well, and I guess she knew how to cook, because she had to learn it.</sentence><sentence id="156">But then we always had a maid or somebody else who cooked, so Mother didn't -- I mean, she brought up my sister and me, but that was about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
