<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: Oh, I have some nice, fond thoughts of my <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> because in the fourth grade I had the teacher named McLaughlin who was very fond of me and I was a good student and she challenged me in more ways than one, in the work that I was doing because I got special work over and above what she taught the general class, because it was such a mixed group.</sentence><sentence id="65">And it was at that time that my mother and I went to visit Europe and this teacher encouraged it, even though I was going to be</sentence><sentence id="67">absent for a period of time, and encouraged it very strongly and wa -- I wrote to her and we communicated during the time I was gone.</sentence><sentence id="68">As a result though, I was gone about a year and a half and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, i-in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, so going back to the - - my <span class="BUILDING">parent's homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">And -- but decided at that time -- the decision, that is, was left to me by my parents as to whether I wanted to stay there or whether I wanted to come back here and I chose to come back here, wanting to be back in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and from then on it was just here.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="162">A: Yes, from my father particularly because he was in World War I and the stories that he told about that war were easily translated into what was going on there now.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="163">And he was quite happy that I had decided not to stay there because that's when Hitler was rising in his power and he said, this man is evil.</sentence><sentence id="164">And some of the things that he was perpetrating against his own -- own people there, even though he wasn't a real German, were pretty atrocious.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="168">9 Interview with John Bucur August 18, 2003</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: It sounds like your father was quite aware of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but we-were you also aware of things like, let's say the Berlin Olympics, do you remember that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Yes, I do.</sentence><sentence id="171">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>, yes, yes, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="172">The reason for that is because my father was a very avid follower of what was going on and s -- and not only by paper but radio had just come in during this particular time and we had a good radio that we kept up with what was going on, and as a result it rubbed off on me because when we talked about it and -- even at <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or anyplace else, and the men spoke, the children were there and we listened and we heard an-and participated actually, in -- in many of the discussions that were had.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Do you remember any of the things that were said in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> about Hitler and what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
