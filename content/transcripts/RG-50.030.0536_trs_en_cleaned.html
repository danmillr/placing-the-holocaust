<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: That's correct, that's correct.</sentence><sentence id="304">And I remember we arrived at the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and I clearly remember an example of Nazi humor.</sentence><sentence id="305">There was a -- a <span class="DLF">roadside</span> -- a roadside sign which says in German, nach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palistina</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">And we were just -- we were just pushed to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and then the Germans returned to their side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and we were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> for a few days, and it was not clear what those few days will bring, and where we will end up.</sentence><sentence id="307">I remember we stopped in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span>, and my mother wanted a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she could wash me and my kid brother.</sentence><sentence id="308">And it turned out that the only place where you could get washed was the <span class="BUILDING">local mikveh</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">religious bathhouse</span> where -- where women would immerse themselves after their periods, to make themselves again clean.</sentence><sentence id="309">And in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with a single industry.</sentence><sentence id="310">The industry was making twittel(ph) -- making the phylacteries that observant Jews used for prayers on their hands, on their arms and on their forehead.</sentence><sentence id="311">And then a few days later we met my father, who was looking for us because the army, the Polish army disintegrated, and the -- there was absolutely nothing else for him to do.</sentence><sentence id="312">And there</sentence><sentence id="314">were people roaming around looking for deported relatives and friends.</sentence><sentence id="315">And that's how -- and that's how he found us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: Did he know that you had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.567" long="25.6">Tarnopol</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="333">But he figured it out because that was the only relative that we had on that side of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">And so he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.567" long="25.6">Tarnopol</span>, and so did we, and that's where we met.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: So, you were not deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.567" long="25.6">Tarnopol</span>, you were deported over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San river</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: I mean, your mother had to figure out what to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: That's right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: And those few days that you spent pr-prior to going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.567" long="25.6">Tarnopol</span>, were they terrible?</sentence><sentence id="351">I mean were there -- were there a lot of people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: Oh, there were a lot of people, but they were not terrible, because there were no shortages, and whoever lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span> would try to share with us some food or whatever else was available.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: So, when you were sent over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San river</span>, that -- that -- you were walking, I gather.</sentence></p></dialogue>
