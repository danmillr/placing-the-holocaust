<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Yes, because it was a problem, and my father also.</sentence><sentence id="193">I don't know to what extent he knew what to do or didn't know because in those days, actually, if a father was a physician, he was not permitted to treat his son.</sentence><sentence id="194">You had to go to someone else, and the pediatrician, my pediatrician, was a man by the name of Dr. Rabinovitz, who was the father of the head of -- later on -- the head of intelligence in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, , and whose nephew was the Israeli Ambassador here, Rabinovitz in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">They all come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, and the father, Dr. Rabinovitz was my pediatrician.</sentence><sentence id="196">So, I don't remember if I was taken to him for this or they just spoke over the telephone or what.</sentence><sentence id="197">This, of course, I don't know, but-</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: And, was he an easy going...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: He was easy going, yes.</sentence><sentence id="246">He loved to read.</sentence><sentence id="247">He devoured reading, and it's very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="248">The last two years of the <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span>, he remained sitting.</sentence><sentence id="249">He failed because he was interested in his own agenda just to read.</sentence><sentence id="250">He was interested, and he just kept on reading and didn't care about <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but this happened with me too when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">One day, I remember coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and declaring, "I know everything there is to know.</sentence><sentence id="252">I know how to count to a hundred."</sentence><sentence id="253">I knew the alphabet.</sentence><sentence id="254">"And, I'm not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore or if I have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I will simply not pay attention because I love to play with my games and toys, et cetera, et cetera."</sentence><sentence id="255">And, sure enough I failed every course save English because English was something - you were a wizard if you learned English and very, very few people because my parents were brought up with French, but I was brought up with English.</sentence><sentence id="256">I had British tutors and so did my older brother.</sentence><sentence id="257">So, I passed only one subject.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: English.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: English, and that was English.</sentence><sentence id="274">I remained sitting, and what was -- what happened was war broke out and the first thing in 1941, I thought, "My god, war broke out now.</sentence><sentence id="275">I will not have to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: And, that was relieving to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: That was very -- that was a relief that I would not have to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Were your parents upset that you were happy about this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: No, no, actually, I've been thinking about it, and I don't remember having discussed this with my father, but they did not seem to be perturbed or anything of the sort.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: And, no one said to you, "You don't know everything, George, if you just can count to a hundred."</sentence><sentence id="291">I mean nobody -- they just accepted what you said.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: They accepted what I said, and they let me play, and I played a lot.</sentence><sentence id="295">I was fortunate to have a lot of toys, and I just -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, toys, all sorts of toys.</sentence><sentence id="296">I was imaging that I was a general -- that was already in 1939, 1940 -- on the <span class="DLF">Line</span> and a cousin of mine was the general of the Siegfried, yeah, he was Siegfried Lineland, and I was .</sentence><sentence id="297">We played war, and we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>, and we had all sorts of toys.</sentence><sentence id="298">The cousin, this cousin actually is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="299">He's older than I am.</sentence><sentence id="300">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="301">So, we often, whenever we meet, we talk about our days when we used to play war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Now, you were probably brought up in a fairly wealthy situation.</sentence><sentence id="311">Am I correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Yes, yes, and that was also a little bit embarrassing because about -- thinking about it in anticipation of today, about fifteen years or so ago, there was a gathering of Latian Jews, and I, not thinking, I made the statement that I do not remember -- there were no, I said, "Categorically, there were no poor people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> who were Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>."</sentence><sentence id="315">So, they snickered at me saying, "You don't know this.</sentence><sentence id="316">You and your family probably didn't know that there were poor Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, but there were plenty of poor Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>."</sentence><sentence id="317">This came to me as a surprise.</sentence><sentence id="318">I should" ve thought it through, obviously, but I had never met -- let's put it this way -- one who was not, well, well endowed from this perspective.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: And, did you live in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: We had a large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, very large, probably -- well, not probably, it was considered the foremost <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="327">It had ten <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: And, was your <span class="BUILDING">father's office</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: In the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, yeah, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: Did that mean that he came upstairs for lunch and you would all eat lunch together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Well, yes he would -- what we called lunch was dinner, and in the evening was supper, and we had dinner very late about two, two-thirty because my father between ten and twelve he saw patients in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, or was it nine-thirty.</sentence><sentence id="337">Then, he also made house calls.</sentence><sentence id="338">Then, he would come for lunch, go out again on house calls, and then he</sentence><sentence id="340">had <span class="BUILDING">office</span> hours, if memory -- memory serves me right, from four to six.</sentence><sentence id="341">But, he had so many patients that he sometimes did not come and have supper before eight, eight- thirty when I did not see him because I was already in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or whatever.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: And, dinner when you would eat what we call lunch, but dinner in the middle of the day, were there a lot of conversation?</sentence><sentence id="351">Was this is a very perfunctory sort of eating?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No, it was always interesting conversation, and when I was finally permitted to join them, when I was sufficiently trained, I enjoyed it very, very much.</sentence><sentence id="355">But, then, when I did sort of things that were unacceptable at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, I was sent back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: And, where would be "back" to-?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: To my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: Would you eat there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: I would eat there with my governess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: But, when I was permitted to sit at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> -- see, I try to make sure that I wouldn't really spoil things because I didn't want to be sent back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: But, from time to time, I was sent back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: And, was this your mother making the decision?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1610">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1612">A: -figure, but I do remember if we wanted to have meat, it also became scarce, and our new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not far from the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, and every person could buy so much and so much meat.</sentence><sentence id="1613">So, I went online to buy a pound or a kilo or half a kilo, I don't remember, and I paid.</sentence><sentence id="1614">So, we had -- and, my mother went online.</sentence><sentence id="1615">So, that between the two of us, we were able to buy enough for a sumptuous meal.</sentence><sentence id="1616">To give you just one idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1655">Q: Now, are you beginning -- forget the Jewishness part for a moment -- but, are you beginning to feel the harshness of what war means, and what occupation means, or is this you think because they're communists and so-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1657">A: They're communists and we were vitriolicly anti-communist, and in my class, almost everyone joined the Communist Pioneers.</sentence><sentence id="1658">I did not because we belonged to the "Bourgeois Class" and we were -- the class was being lambasted all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1659">And, we were scared, but nothing seemed to happen, nothing happened until one week before the outbreak of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1665">A: deg41, exactly one week before the outbreak of the war, on Sunday, suddenly <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian trucks</span> appeared all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> telling you you have to pack your things and leave.</sentence><sentence id="1666">We'll take you to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1667">We didn't know whether we would be taken, too, but a lot of the well-to-do people, a lot of the Jews, also Latvians, but proportionally more Jews than Latvians, were taken and shipped off to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and to that part of the world in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, and this was just one week, exactly the Sunday before the outbreak of the war between <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1671">Q: Now, when you say that you were -- and I'm assuming you mean the family -- was vitriolicly anti-Communist, is that what you believed about the Communists or is that because the Communists saw you as Bourgeois and would not accept you?</sentence><sentence id="1672">Or, was it both?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1675">A: I think it was both.</sentence><sentence id="1676">I think it was both.</sentence><sentence id="1677">Again, I can't be a hundred percent certain, but I just know we were anti-Communist, and it was my decision not to join the youth movement.</sentence><sentence id="1678">Again, my parents didn't say anything that I had to or so.</sentence><sentence id="1679">My father felt probably significantly secure again because of his specialty as a gastroenterologist, not to be too worried, but still, and also the fact that he had prominent Russians now from the Russian Army and the Russian Navy as patients.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1685">Q: And, let me ask you something -- is part of the reason also that you didn't want to join not just ideological but the fact that they were also very disciplined and you were going to be indoctrinated on certain things, or you just didn't agree with them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1687">A: I just didn't agree with them, and I didn't -- at that time, I tried to intuit myself into that situation.</sentence><sentence id="1688">At that time, I simply thought that Communism was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1689">Why?</sentence><sentence id="1690">I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2152">Q: So, how did you feel that he asked the Germans this question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2154">A: He came back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2156">Q: And he told you what he asked them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2158">A: Yeah, he told us and my brother, my mother and me et cetera, yes, and we all listened, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2159">There was a kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">command car</span> that appeared and he was part of the welcoming committee that he was asked to participate, and in this context he asked about the Jewish question, and he was assured by this officer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2162">Q: That everything would be okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2164">A: That, Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2166">Q: Is this as if your father either knew nothing or paid no attention to what was happening to Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2167">Did you have any idea?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2170">A: Originally, I'm convinced.</sentence><sentence id="2171">Again, this is my interpretation that he did not genuinely believe my aunt when she said-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2174">Q: What had happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2176">A: -what had happened with the Germans with the Jewish women polishing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with furs.</sentence><sentence id="2177">Later on, my interpretation again, is that he did not want to worry the family.</sentence><sentence id="2178">So, he always looked at the glass half full rather than half empty.</sentence><sentence id="2179">That's my interpretation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2184">Q: Is it possible that he never asked the Germans this?</sentence><sentence id="2185">He simply told you this so you'd feel okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2188">A: I would -- it could very well be the case.</sentence><sentence id="2189">It could very well be the case, and then afterwards the same day, we took our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage</span> and we walked back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>,</sentence><sentence id="2191">5 and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was still standing and we saw the German occupiers on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they left us alone.</sentence><sentence id="2192">We left them alone.</sentence><sentence id="2193">I remember staring at them, and then we went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2202">Q: The same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, the smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2204">A: Yes, but in the meantime we had also heard that a number of Jews were shot by Latvians because the Latvians were also vitriolicly anti-Communist, and in some of the German propaganda that leaked through, I guess, the Germans equated Bolshevism with Judaism so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2205">So, apparently, some people were shot even before, just before the German occupation took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q: So, how long is it when things become rougher and it's no longer the same life for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2210">A: Almost immediately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2212">Q: Almost immediately?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2214">A: Almost immediately.</sentence><sentence id="2215">I remember my father having to go to a <span class="BUILDING">gathering place</span> every morning to be assigned for work.</sentence><sentence id="2216">My father wore his red cross arm band.</sentence><sentence id="2217">My brother going to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2218">A cousin of mine was shot dead by the Germans apparently, he had just married a Latvian girl before.</sentence><sentence id="2219">She was pregnant, but I was lead to understand that she also had a lover, and I was lead to understand that she denounced him as a Jew and he was shot and my father was called on to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to identify the body, and he came back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was there, pale saying, "Yes it was who was shot dead."</sentence><sentence id="2220">He identified the body, and that was about a week to ten days after the occupation, and it was not long thereafter when my father was arrested, tortured and killed, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2221">So, we immediately began to feel it, almost immediately, within days I would say, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2230">Q: And, when you saw that your father coming back, it must have been very shocking to you to see him looking-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2232">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2234">Q: He must have looked awful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2236">A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2237">Then, I no longer thought in terms of me and the I, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2238">I began thinking in terms of the larger picture that is our fate, no longer my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2239">I mean, this became irrelevant.</sentence><sentence id="2240">It was not even a footnote in my life.</sentence><sentence id="2241">Now, the issue became life and death.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2275">Q: So, do you have trouble sleeping now when you're-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2277">A: Now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2279">Q: No, I don't mean now.</sentence><sentence id="2280">I'm sorry, now meaning at the point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2283">A: At the point, I don't remember having trouble sleeping.</sentence><sentence id="2284">I slept.</sentence><sentence id="2285">I lead an active life in so far as I kept up with the news, the latest news, what's happening all the gossip, the dangers, by the time the evening came around, I assume I was exhausted.</sentence><sentence id="2286">I was still a kid.</sentence><sentence id="2287">So, I seemed to sleep very well.</sentence><sentence id="2288">My mother was assigned to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, and sometimes she was able to take me with her.</sentence><sentence id="2289">This was she was kind of a seamstress, ironing.</sentence><sentence id="2290">I remember her doing working in, I guess it must have been a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">laundry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2291">If I think of it today, for the German Air Force in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2292">She was, and then at a certain point, she became the housekeeper, maid for the mistress, for the Latvian mistress for the head of the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, and my mother knew her from before the war because they used to meet at the same hairdressers called Mary's.</sentence><sentence id="2293">I still remember.</sentence><sentence id="2294">This mistress apparently had a liking, took a liking to my mother, and sent a long to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but this was already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> period.</sentence><sentence id="2295">But, before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> period already, extra food and when she knew that things were going to happen to Jews, she would tell my mother, "You better bring George with you to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2296">So, I would stay for the day at the apartment safe when my mother was cleaning or whatever, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2297">But, things became in a sense chaotic, but there was within this chaos, there was still order.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2313">Q: How -- I don't know whether at the time you would know, but perhaps only afterwards when you talked with your mother, how did she take to doing this?</sentence><sentence id="2314">She was never doing this sort of work in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2315">So, all of a sudden, she's acting as someone's maid and she's ironing and she's-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2319">A: She said to me circumstances dictate what you have to do.</sentence><sentence id="2320">She took it very stoically.</sentence><sentence id="2321">She took it very -- but, she -- ve never seen my mother in tears before.</sentence><sentence id="2322">I've never seen my mother in a state of hysteria.</sentence><sentence id="2323">When my father was arrested, she ran all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to her Latvian colleagues who did not raise a finger for my late father.</sentence><sentence id="2324">Some</sentence><sentence id="2326">7 of the Latvian doctors, I guess you know jealousy, professional jealousy whatever, but nothing unusual.</sentence><sentence id="2327">They didn't raise a finger even though it was an issue of life and death.</sentence><sentence id="2328">She went to the pleading for my father.</sentence><sentence id="2329">She left no stone unturned, and at a certain point was told by the man who really killed my father that he'Il be released but a wound has to heal, that guy apparently knocked out one of his eyes, and was told that they really needed him because of his specialty, but the wound never healed.</sentence><sentence id="2330">So, they didn't want to release him in that condition.</sentence><sentence id="2331">So, they decided to shoot him instead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2347">Q: And, that you heard later?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2349">A: That I heard later, but a patient, a Latvian patient of my father's came with the news that his eye was knocked out.</sentence><sentence id="2350">He heard it from I guess a Latvian guard in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> or whatever, and I've also heard it from his fellow prison inmates, Jews who were later on liberated or I saw later, what happened to my father because they were eyewitnesses.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2353">Q: Do you remember the day your father was arrested or weren't you <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2355">A: He didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">It was toward the end of July 1941, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2359">Q: So, he was working in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2361">A: He was not working in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at that time, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2363">Q: Or, he was doing forced labor, I guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2365">A Yes, but as a doctor, as a doctor he was doing this.</sentence><sentence id="2366">This was the end of July, and then he was shot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2369">Q: So, how did you understand this as a young child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2371">A: Horrified, absolutely horrified, and you didn't -- I didn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="2372">I didn't understand why we had to suffer simply because being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2373">I hardly knew what it meant before the war.</sentence><sentence id="2374">As I said, I knew I was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="2375">I knew about Matza, Passover, about certain High Holidays, or when my mother and father fasted, or turning on candles commemorating the dead, et cetera, but otherwise I really did not know much about the significance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2381">Q: So, there's no logic here for you.</sentence><sentence id="2382">I mean, nothing makes-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2385">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2387">Q: And, even if the-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2393">A: What the logic was I'm suffering because I'm a Jew, but I didn't understand why I had to suffer because I'm a Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2395">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2396">Then, how do you understand death and murder?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2399">A: I didn't analyze it.</sentence><sentence id="2400">I did not, but I remember later on thinking -- initially, I did not want to die, but later on after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>, et cetera, I did not mind.</sentence><sentence id="2401">I thought myself because I know that the Germans are going to be defeated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2405">Q: So, you didn't mind the thought that you might die?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2407">A: Yeah, I did no longer mind it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2409">Q: Isee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2411">A: To see <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> destroyed, that was it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2413">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2415">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2416">Because I remember in the severe winter, well -- I remember in maybe it's later it's been cut now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2419">Q: No, you have another minute.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2421">A I remember it was a very severe winter, 1941-42, where I got frostbite in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, frostbite on my toes and my fingers, thinking perhaps if the Germans would win the war, there would no longer be a reason to punish Jews for whatever reason, and things would get better.</sentence><sentence id="2422">So, for a moment, I even thought, however perverse it may sound today, but as a child, perhaps the Germans should win and then we will be relieved of this misery, of this uncertainty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2425">Q: So, confusion reigns in some ways.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2427">A: Confusion reigns, but death was there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2450">Q: Tell me how you remember your mother was during this period.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2452">A: She -- I've never seen her before crying or being hysterical.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2454">Q: But she was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2456">A: She was absolutely hysterical when it happened.</sentence><sentence id="2457">She would say our our dad, our daddy, how are we going on from here?</sentence><sentence id="2458">We must do everything possible to rescue him, and she started running around and we still had some hidden diamonds and gold coins so on and so forth, and she bribed some of the Latvian colleagues especially one who used to be a neighbor of ours, Dr. , a neighbor of ours when we lived in the -- before the Russians came in, in the same.</sentence><sentence id="2459">There were two <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> to the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and he lived in one of them.</sentence><sentence id="2460">And, he said, "There's nothing I can do."</sentence><sentence id="2461">She went to some other Latvian colleagues.</sentence><sentence id="2462">They said, "Well, there's really nothing we can do or help or say."</sentence><sentence id="2463">She then went to the , but I don't think she did give anything to the people in terms of gold coins or diamonds, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2464">It would've been much too dangerous, and there was this one person who apparently knocked out my father's eye, Handtke who was tried after World War II in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> where apparently I have the transcripts where this whole issue was brought up.</sentence><sentence id="2465">He defended himself.</sentence><sentence id="2466">I don't remember the details from the transcripts, and he finally said to my mother after several days, "Yes, we're going to release your husband once the wound" some sort of wound "he has will be healed, but the wound never healed so they decided to shoot him instead."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2478">Q: And, how long did it take before she found out that he was dead?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2480">A: The first news as I remember, came from a former Latvian patient of my father's who came to visit us with the news that he had heard, and then also some of the people who were arrested together with him, some of them were released who saw it, and others were also shot relatively speaking at the same time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2489">Q: And, did your mother then become very practical about trying to figure out how to help the three of you survive together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2491">A: She relied heavily on my older brother who had leadership qualities which she did not really, nor of course I, as a child.</sentence><sentence id="2492">So, she relied very much on my brother, and together with whatever help I could give, we manipulated the situation to the best of our knowledge.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2495">Q: Your brother is about twenty years old in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="2496">Am I correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2549">Q: So, your mother has a couple of jobs, and are you still living in that smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2551">A: No, in the meantime, several times we had to move.</sentence><sentence id="2552">We moved in to one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> near my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a short time.</sentence><sentence id="2553">Let me get the sequence straight.</sentence><sentence id="2554">Oh, my -- we moved into the <span class="INT_SPACE">servant quarters</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Kessel Villa</span>, K-e-s-s-e-1, because my brother married the daughter, but this was already a war marriage, had no legal validity to the best of my knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="2555">So, the front part was occupied, the main part of the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> was occupied by Mrs. Stein who was Latvian.</sentence><sentence id="2556">Her husband was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2557">So, she lived there with a daughter, and Mr. Stein, the Kessel's -- the husband was already killed, Mrs. Kessel and her two daughters, and my brother and I and my mother, we lived behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> what used to be known as the <span class="INT_SPACE">servant's quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2558">We lived there for a while until we had to move from there and moved to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span> which was near my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where we were in three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> -- one, two, three.</sentence><sentence id="2559">We were one -- my brother and his newly acquired wife, myself -- we lived, slept in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2560">My mother slept in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, another woman -- Mrs. Boop slept in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was in Mrs.Boop's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2561">Yes, she was killed during the war, and two young women slept in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2562">So we were about six or seven people in this small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of about four or five <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, excluding the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2563">And, from there, well an announcement came that we will be moved to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- we'll have to move to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which is ina part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, a section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> that I did not know very well, and there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> this was in the summer of "43, we were assigned to a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> that had a kind of an <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> was a few steps -- we had to go about five or six steps, right off the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>, <span class="DLF">rear entrance</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and there including the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> there were one, two, three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2564">So, two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and where people could sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2565">In these two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, my brother and his wife, and my mother and I slept, in this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement apartment</span>, and in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there were about four people who slept, and we shared the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2566">We shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathing facilities</span>, and we made the best of this situation.</sentence><sentence id="2567">I was working for a while in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, <span class="DLF">vegetable garden</span>, and then I was "asked, invited" to become the commandant's runner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2568">The commandant was not a bad person actually, Kerscher.</sentence><sentence id="2569">He closed his eyes to many things especially when people brought in some extra food to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2570">He did not make a big deal out of it, but of course, we also managed to give him things that is not only the Schwabs but other people with means before the war who had saved a gold coin here, a diamond there, a fur coat, whatever, gave it to</sentence><sentence id="2572">2 him, and this reminds me even before we moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there were collections of gold coins.</sentence><sentence id="2573">This in order to try to release Jews from the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to bribe the Germans, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2574">So, this was -- I remember people coming around for specific arrests that were made and collecting, because we were told if we gathered this and this and this and this, we would be able to get that person out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2575">But, this brings me back to before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, way before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2576">Immediately after the revolution in 1917, Lenin needed hard currency, and opened up the <span class="BUILDING">palaces</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2577">You could buy everything and anything for very little money.</sentence><sentence id="2578">And, we had antique -- an antique for example <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> that came from one of the <span class="BUILDING">Czarist palaces</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2579">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chandelier</span> a cobalt with gold chandelier that came from one of the <span class="BUILDING">palaces</span> that my grandparents bought and some of it gave to my father as a gift after World War I, immediately, and some that my father bought including some art works from famous Russian artists that he bought when he was serving in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and right after the revolution that he bought and brought it back to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2580">So, in addition to the Persian carpets and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Grand piano</span>, et cetera, this was very exclusive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that we had from Czarist palaces including a number of chandeliers.</sentence><sentence id="2581">I remember two in particular, and all this was taken by the Germans before we came even to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2582">And, not only the German , but also the German Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2583">There was a certain Inspector Ulmann of the German Navy.</sentence><sentence id="2584">Incidentally, the old -- where we lived before World War IL, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that became the headquarters of the Communist Party during World War II became the headquarters of the German Navy for the <span class="REGION">region</span>, and this Inspector Ulmann came very often to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and with a crew would take a lot of the things from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and then of course, we also had people fromthe _ coming with their crews to take, and there was one guy from the by the name of Strott, S-t-r-o-t-t, who was a collector of stamps, and my late brother had a huge stamp collection and he traded stamps with all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="2585">There was actually an exhibition here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> in memoriam for my brother, a big stamp collection, where it is all described and I have a photograph with my late mother, still.</sentence><sentence id="2586">She was already sick and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2587">This must have be in 1963, when there was this big exhibition in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2588">And, he took, and I'm sure he took it for himself because he was an art collector, and then we had to two Leica cameras, one German and one Russian Leica, I remember, and we gave one of them to one of the Latvians who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to look for things.</sentence><sentence id="2589">I think, and I would have to establish this, I'm not sure, but one of the Latvians was a notorious murderer by the name of Cukurs.</sentence><sentence id="2590">He had several fingers missing.</sentence><sentence id="2591">I don't know how come, but I remember fingers were missing, and for some reason I associate him with the name Cukurs who was a deputy to Arias, the famous Arias, commander of Latvians who killed Jews with a vengeance.</sentence><sentence id="2592">And, this man with the fingers came and looked for things, and I remember very distinctly my mother giving him one of the Leicas because we had two still hidden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2593">This is when we were still living in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to which we moved during the Russian period.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2640">Q: The smaller.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2642">A: Yes, the smaller <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2643">So, these are some of the things that suddenly come back about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2644">Now, how did we get up to this question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2655">Q: You went back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but I would like to stay in this period for a moment, and ask you what was probably a peculiar question.</sentence><sentence id="2656">Was there anything like a funeral for your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2659">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2661">Q: Nothing?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2667">A: Nothing, never saw him, no, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2669">Q: So, did your mother go into mourning in some way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2671">A: You couldn't mourn in the sense in those days you would wear black for a whole year, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2672">This you couldn't do.</sentence><sentence id="2673">There was no way of doing it.</sentence><sentence id="2674">You had to go in the morning to work whatever, and then they would come back and in the evening hoping to find me still there, alive, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2675">So-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2681">Q: So, there's really no time for any-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2683">A: Shiva or so on, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2685">Q: There's no way to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2687">A: No, I don't remember -- we didn't even know exactly the date, but this was irrelevant, but I don't remember a Shiva.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2689">Q: And, do you remember yourself responding in way like your mother because you lost your father, or did you not understand what it really meant to lose your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2691">A: I understood.</sentence><sentence id="2692">I missed him very much, but I didn't understand what it meant that he was shot, but then I had some sort of an inkling because when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where he identified my cousin that the person was suddenly dead, and my father was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2693">What I couldn't understand is that I'll never see him again.</sentence><sentence id="2694">This I do remember, that I may never see him again.</sentence><sentence id="2695">This I do remember very, very distinctly, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2701">Q: How did you -- was there a notice to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2703">A: Yes the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bekantmachung</span></sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2705">Q: And, what is that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2711">A: The bekantmachung means a kind of an announcement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2713">Q: So, it was a public announcement?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2715">A: It was a public announcement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2717">Q: Like a poster?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2719">A: Yes, yes, by that and that date we had to move in, and then we were assigned the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2721">Q: So, do you even as a child begin to feel that your life is getting more and more constricted, or you have no-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2723">A: Oh, yes, not only this, but I was at a certain point coming to this, even going back before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when we had to wear the yellow star and had to deliver our radios and other things right after the occupation, and we were not permitted to go on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2724">We could only go right off the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>, and I remember it was in the winter, going and a fellow student, a girl, came in my direction.</sentence><sentence id="2725">We were in the same class, and we walked and I wanted to say hello to her, and it happened to be a girl I fancied as a child.</sentence><sentence id="2726">Veltina was her name.</sentence><sentence id="2727">She sort of looked away, and I felt embarrassed that I was a Jew, that I had to wear this and I could not go on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2728">It was something strange.</sentence><sentence id="2729">Why should I feel embarrassed?</sentence><sentence id="2730">But, I remember feeling embarrassed that I am who I am.</sentence><sentence id="2731">It's a very strange sensation that I had, just as strange as the same winter when I thought maybe a German victory would be helpful to us.</sentence><sentence id="2732">Let the Germans win.</sentence><sentence id="2733">Logical, perhaps for a child, but for an adult, obviously not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2745">Q: Did you ever say anything to your mother or your brother that you were embarrassed, felt ashamed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2747">A: Not in this context, in a different context.</sentence><sentence id="2748">The children in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> didn't like to play with me because I didn't speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="2749">I spoke German, and they used to call me kind of a yeke.</sentence><sentence id="2750">I did not speak it, and I remember going to my mother crying saying, "The children don't want to play with me because I don't speak Yiddish", and I remember my mother saying to me, "George, there's really nothing I can do about it.</sentence><sentence id="2751">I don't speak Yiddish either.</sentence><sentence id="2752">We have to make the best of the situation."</sentence><sentence id="2753">And, it is in this context that I began to acquire Yiddish because this became the lingual the accepted language in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, et cetera.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2761">Q: Isee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2763">A: So, just like I acquired Russian, I acquired a smattering of Yiddish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2772">Q: The Jews that you are meeting in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, were they not of your economic class because the Russians had sent out most of the Bourgeois?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2774">A: They didn't send out most of the Bourgeois.</sentence><sentence id="2775">They sent out a good number, but I assume, but in those days I didn't think in terms of classes, et cetera.</sentence><sentence id="2776">I didn't think in terms -- I didn't think in these terms, but in retrospect, I would say that they came from a milieu from which I did not come, period.</sentence><sentence id="2777">I mean, that's how I would put it now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2782">Q: And, did that make you feel uncomfortable because they were so dissimilar in terms of background?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2784">A: No, I felt -- I felt bad that they would not accept me and at the same time, I was envious because they were stronger than I was.</sentence><sentence id="2785">They were better athletes than I was.</sentence><sentence id="2786">In many ways, they were far superior to me.</sentence><sentence id="2787">So, I was envious actually, and they spoke Yiddish which I did not.</sentence><sentence id="2788">So, I was envious too.</sentence><sentence id="2789">But, as a child, you can acquire language very easily.</sentence><sentence id="2790">So-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2798">Q: So, how quickly did you acquire Yiddish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2800">A: I guess I still probably have a vocabulary of about 150 or 200 words.</sentence><sentence id="2801">So, I could get by.</sentence><sentence id="2802">In other words, with my limited vocabulary, I could get by, and but also interesting because the Yiddish we speak in the <span class="REGION">Baltic countries</span> is different from the Polish Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="2803">For example, I'm now the Vice President of the Sholom Aleichem Foundation even though my Yiddish is almost non-existent as is Belle Kaufman's Yiddish almost non-existent, the granddaughter of Sholom Aleichem, who is still alive at 93 and is our Chairman.</sentence><sentence id="2804">When we have the annual meetings of the Sholom Aleichem meetings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> commemorating his death because it's according to his will, when some of the Yiddish actors read his writings in the Polish Yiddish especially in the .</sentence><sentence id="2805">Yiddish, I don't understand 95 percent.</sentence><sentence id="2806">If somebody reads it with a Baltic accent, not an accent, but pronunciation, I understand fifty percent because the Yiddish is more akin to the German.</sentence><sentence id="2807">To give you just one example, when you say -- in German you say , in the Baltic Yiddish it would be __, and in the Yiddish it would be "</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2817">Q: So, it's quite different?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2819">A: Quite different.</sentence><sentence id="2820">So, I just I have difficulties with this, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2823">Q: Did you mother learn Yiddish in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> also?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2825">A: I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2826">I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2827">This was not a problem for her.</sentence><sentence id="2828">It was a problem for-</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2833">Q: For you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2838">A: For me, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2840">Q: I think we need to change the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2844">7 Tape 6</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2848">Q: George, let me just go way back for a second just so we get a context for your family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2850">I assume that your father did not become very wealthy because he was a doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lativa</span>, that there was money in the family before.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2851">A: Yes, there was money in the family before, but he also did very well, and I remember my mother telling me that he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and take out from his pockets lots of money saying, "You have brought me a lot of luck, Clairehen, Claire.</sentence><sentence id="2852">Look how well I'm doing in my practice."</sentence><sentence id="2853">So, independently of his parents, but my grandfather was a big merchant in the grains -- import and export -- and, we had at least one <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that I was aware of with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> in front of it, <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span>, right at the <span class="DLF">pier</span>, because he exported a lot to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and elsewhere, but one of my relatives told me that we had another <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> on the other side of the <span class="DLF">pier</span> exactly facing it.</sentence><sentence id="2854">This I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2855">Maybe they sold it very early on, but I only knew of the other one because it was not sold until the late "30s, the other one.</sentence><sentence id="2856">So, maybe the first one they didn't bother talking about.</sentence><sentence id="2857">But, I did not know until I heard about it over here that there was a second one.</sentence><sentence id="2858">Also, to give you a little background, what I found out over here is that when the governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Petersburg</span> came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span>, he would always come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> and play bridge with my grandfather, and they were very good friends, but I would think that the big money came from my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="2859">But, my father did very well in his practice, in his practice, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2869">Q: And, was your mother's family a well-to-do family also?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2871">A: Not as well-off as my father's family, but in the six sisters, three brothers, they all went to <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, the three brothers.</sentence><sentence id="2872">The six sisters all went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, and there you had to pay in those days and <span class="BUILDING">music conservatory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2873">My grandfather owned an upscale <span class="BUILDING">delicatessen store</span>, and my mother tells me he brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the most delicious things everyday from the <span class="BUILDING">delicatessen</span> something like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and my grandmother, the big money apparently came from my grandmother who came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian city</span> of and her maiden name was .</sentence><sentence id="2874">She came from a very, very well-to-do family, and each daughter, and there was a large family, each daughter received a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> as a dowry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2879">Q: Wow.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2881">A: Yeah, so, and she had six sisters and three brothers and all were educated this and that so, you had to have some means in order to do this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2883">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2885">A: And, in my father's family, the mother of my cousin over here studied at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Geneva</span> in those days before World War I, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2894">Q: Interesting.</sentence><sentence id="2895">It seemed important to get a bit of that background which we didn't get before.</sentence><sentence id="2896">Now, let's go back to this not so great situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2897">How did you become a runner for the commandant?</sentence><sentence id="2898">Do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2904">A: My German was good.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2906">Q: Clearly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2908">A: Yes, it was my native tongue, maybe I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2909">It's an interpretation.</sentence><sentence id="2910">Maybe this was one reason why I was "invited" to become his runner.</sentence><sentence id="2911">A second reason perhaps, it's my interpretation again is because I came from a certain <span class="NPIP">background</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2912">I don't know if this played a role, but in addition to being a runner for him - when I would have to, when I would get a pass that nothing should happen to me while I brng a watch which was repaired in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to, let's say to or to SS who was the head of the SS in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Libau</span> or to Inspector of the .</sentence><sentence id="2913">So, and I could communicate with the staff over there whatever it is in German.</sentence><sentence id="2914">Perhaps this is a reason, but again, as | said before, it's pure speculation and I do not know the facts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2922">Q: So, the job that you had to be a runner was primarily going from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> outside delivering.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2924">A: And, also keeping count of the inmates.</sentence><sentence id="2925">When we moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we had something like 823 people survived out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> of close to 8,000.</sentence><sentence id="2926">And, when -- in the morning when they left, they were given a tag, a metal tag so I had to give them the metal tags as they went out to work in <span class="DLF">columns</span>, and in the late afternoon, I had to collect these tags and hang them up.</sentence><sentence id="2927">So, I remember the numbers, and you could see immediately if somebody escaped or what.</sentence><sentence id="2928">The number, you associated that with a name, and that is how you kept tabs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2934">Q: And, did you have to write down the person to whom you gave the number?</sentence></p></dialogue>
