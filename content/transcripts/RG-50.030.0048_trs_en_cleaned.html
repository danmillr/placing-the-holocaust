they slept with them.</sentence><sentence id="3582">And every night, these two boyfriends -- these, these soldiers -- came to them every evening with their rifles, you know, when I saw old rifles and soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="3583">I thought, "Oh, maybe they will kill me today."</sentence><sentence id="3584">And they slept with them.</sentence><sentence id="3585">In the morning, they left.</sentence><sentence id="3586">And sometimes I think they suspect, because they probably heard the noise over their head.</sentence><sentence id="3587">And they maybe suspect that maybe something

didn't let me go after her.</sentence><sentence id="3600">And she went there, and lift the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> up and she went on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and she looked around.</sentence><sentence id="3601">But you see, before, when they built this, this <span class="DLF">wall</span>, I put there old things, old, some junks.</sentence><sentence id="3602">Old, that if somebody will come, will see that I have storage there.</sentence><sentence id="3603">Old some dresses, some, some, some junk, all old.</sentence><sentence id="3604">And she looked around carefully,
