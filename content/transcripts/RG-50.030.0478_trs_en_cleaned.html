<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2363">Q: That's okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2365">A: We were isolated and walking from <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">workplace</span>, accompanied by gendarmes.</sentence><sentence id="2366">By June 1942, the last of these town inhabitants was evacuated by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2367">I don't know how they were accommodated, whether they found them, but that wasn't my problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2383">A: And from then on, the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were open, and when you finished your job, your work, your assigned work, you could go with that family and move around without being accompanied or guarded.</sentence><sentence id="2384">So I went from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and part of just preparing the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, was also training people to -- to -- I did get information of what is in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2385">And I got information how many people are already living there.</sentence><sentence id="2386">So based on that, I made use of supplies for individual <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and later on even a sophisticated menu, how many grams of what to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2391">Q: Really?</sentence><sentence id="2392">So how did you figure this out?</sentence><sentence id="2393">I mean, these are much larger populations than you were ever trained to feed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2397">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2398">I told you, there's one -- there were some women who were able to administer the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, not just the butchers, and that [indecipherable] it's -- it's funny that there was no meat, but the butchers seemed to be the best administrators of a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2401">Q: Did -- w-were you the person who was in control of the amount of -- of whatever ingredients could be sent, whether it was flour, it was sugar, it would be sent to this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, or that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, or this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2407">A: That -- that started out this way.</sentence><sentence id="2408">Later there were people who were in business, food business, so I had <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> at -- and groceries and -- and other related business.</sentence><sentence id="2409">They became -- they became the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> -- o-operating the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, and this -- they didn't got the information, and without my interference or -- or participation, based on the initial set-up, delivered directly to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2413">Q: And were there equal rations given to each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, or were there different -- differences in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2415">A Not in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, the difference was -- and that was -- you know, the Council of Elders had very -- they were, so to say, the town administration.</sentence><sentence id="2416">They were actually a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span>, there was a man designated for transportation and for labor and for health and for supply, and -- and other departments.</sentence><sentence id="2417">But they had very little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for initiative.</sentence><sentence id="2418">That was all based on strict rules set by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2419">However they, where possible, they applied their own decision making.</sentence><sentence id="2420">Like for instance for the children, and that was a little bit later, the -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">children's kitchen</span> was -- was created, that had more of the food a growing child needs, because children were our future.</sentence><sentence id="2421">And they decided those who had hard labor assignments to get more food.</sentence><sentence id="2422">Of course, that was taken away from the general population, but the general population was so large, that the few privileged groups -- and it wasn't privileged, was rewarded appropriately, larger por -- rations.</sentence><sentence id="2423">But it did not impact tremendously.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2433">Q: You don't think it impacted the general population very much?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2435">A: Not much was taken away from all the thousands of the regular population to feed the few -- to improve the ration of the children and the -- those who have hard -- performed hard labor.</sentence><sentence id="2436">So at -- this way I was hopping from one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to another, trying to get the most capable person to stay behind and run it, all while I was 18 - 18 and a half.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2439">Q: Did you feel --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2473">Q: What does that mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2475">A: What does that mean?</sentence><sentence id="2476">That was maybe in the small -- I think it was a p-previous <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in -- for the civilians of the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was then, for people who had diabetes or gall bladder or stuff, to give more of one item that they can have, and less of something that would be harmful to them.</sentence><sentence id="2477">You know, a -- a diet within the framework of availability.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3674">Q: Now, I'm going to go off this topic for just a second, because you mentioned that the old German Jews often committed su -- many committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="3675">How did they commit suicide?</sentence><sentence id="3676">Did they jump out of <span class="DLF">windows</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3680">A: A <span class="DLF">window</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3681">And some may have had the -- the -- taken a excessive dose of sleeping pills, or whatever they still brought with them.</sentence><sentence id="3682">They deteriorated a very rapid fa -- rate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3686">Q: Di -- wi -- I want to continue o-on your relationship and the work with Schacter, but I also wanted to ask you, there were -- there were orchestras in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>, there are composers, there are other conductors, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3688">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3690">Q: So that there is a lot going on.</sentence><sentence id="3691">Am I correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3694">A: How did it come about?</sentence><sentence id="3695">Now there is a -- a saying going around, and you must have heard it, that the Germans picked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to show off with.</sentence><sentence id="3696">It wasn't that way.</sentence><sentence id="3697">I mentioned it among other things in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, they had to turn in their musical instruments, and some didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3698">And some even had the chutzpah, people who will read this may know what that means, had the guts to bring those ins -- smuggle those</sentence><sentence id="3700">5 instruments with i -- within those 110 pounds, instead of food and clothing, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>, because they were so -- such ardent musicians, amateurs and professionals, who loved to play, and because everybody thought it's going to be over in six months.</sentence><sentence id="3701">I spoke about the optimism.</sentence><sentence id="3702">When the six months were over, they gave themselves another six months.</sentence><sentence id="3703">So they played in <span class="INT_SPACE">attics</span>, and in <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>, to stay in shape for when they come out, they should be in the same performance level as they came in.</sentence><sentence id="3704">And although there are no -- were no Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, nothing escaped them, they found out.</sentence><sentence id="3705">And now a terrific fright and concern gripped everyone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because the Germans -- a few Germans kept all these thousands of Jews in check by imposing corrective punishment.</sentence><sentence id="3706">So what that means, were two kinds, either right away into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, with -- and these people were marked, when they were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they know who they are, and they select them -- direct them to the appropriate <span class="NPIP">side</span>, punishing side, or the small <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3707">So nobody wanted to involve their wife, parents, children, siblings in such a punishment, so there was a big concern.</sentence><sentence id="3708">The head of the Council of Elders, Edelstein told the camp commander why -- I mean, not in this exact wording, I'm paraphrasing, why would you punish these few people?</sentence><sentence id="3709">Look at the amount of talent you have accumulated here, why don't you think of a program where you can utilize them to show the world how well you treat the Jews?</sentence><sentence id="3710">That's when this idea came into being.</sentence><sentence id="3711">It was not a preconceived idea with the Germans before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was created.</sentence><sentence id="3712">So not only were these Jews not punished, and could retain their instruments, more instruments were brought in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, and before they determined how they are going to do -- show the world how well they treat the Jews, they already divide -- devised a beautification program in anticipation of that, and a free time activities department was created.</sentence><sentence id="3713">And in the frame of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">orchestras</span> -- jazz has just come to -- to Europe from <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, so we had a five member -- what is it called?</sentence><sentence id="3714">Ghetto swingers.</sentence><sentence id="3715">Ghetto swingers jazz team.</sentence><sentence id="3716">Then there were the two musicians who played in the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3717">One of them was my cousin, the accordionist, he was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and accor -- but there he played the accordion, and one was a violinist.</sentence><sentence id="3718">And -- and other of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">quartets</span>, and unbelievable, not the Germans, and not the Council of Elders could have imagined what's getting news there.</sentence><sentence id="3719">And not only music, there were <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> -- there were all the actors from -- from all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3720">The <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>, <span class="BUILDING">cabaret</span>, those are very popular because they were throwing these verbal darts at the Germans, in Czech language.</sentence><sentence id="3721">Maybe some even in German, I don't know about those.</sentence><sentence id="3722">And this was very uplifting, and very helping in -- in really reducing the anxieties of the life that was destined for us.</sentence><sentence id="3723">There were lectures.</sentence><sentence id="3724">There were 1240 lectures on different subjects.</sentence><sentence id="3725">This is based on the notes from that -- that they found from that free activity -- free time activity list, by professors, chemists, biologists, rabbis.</sentence><sentence id="3726">Nobody went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, but they went there to listen to the rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="3727">And people who had no interest in chemistry and so, went to j -- just to get diversification, and -- and getting away from -- from this dread life of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3728">By the way, they called -- you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> in German is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, and the Nazis told these prominent people they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienbath</span>, which is a <span class="BUILDING">Theresien spa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3729">I didn't say it when we were on the subject.</sentence><sentence id="3730">So it is an unbe -- there was more -- more of these cultural activities per capita than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> or -- or anywhere else, in a day.</sentence><sentence id="3731">And people after work went, and they -- they shortened their sleeping time, because they were not really strong with the -- with the food they were getting, and I don't take blame for it.</sentence><sentence id="3732">I just did what was -- we had.</sentence><sentence id="3733">But it was -- it was unbelievable, it -- it was -- it grew like mushrooms after the rain.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3783">Q: And was this -- when Schacter came in December and started those little choirs in the <span class="BUILDING">men's barrack</span>, and then the <span class="BUILDING">women's barrack</span>, was -- was that secret at that point, or that's -- that was okay at that point?</sentence><sentence id="3784">Do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3787">A: Again, there were no Germans in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and the gendarmes were out at -- outside at the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, and this was happening in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> after work.</sentence><sentence id="3788">I don't think it was clandestine or illegal, it was just unofficial and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3791">Q: So that the permission that was gotten because Epstein said something to the Germans was to bring in the instruments?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3793">A: That was only after it was decided that that's a good idea, we'll take advantage of it, and we divide -- deci -- devise a program that will help them to project them to the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3795">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3797">A: But I don't understand, they had occupied all of Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was across the Atlantic, why would they have to care to show a good report card with good behavior or good treatment of the Jews?</sentence><sentence id="3798">I -- that's what I was thinking about, who -- for whom did they need this?</sentence><sentence id="3799">They were the masters of the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3803">Q: And all of this cultural activity, and intellectual activity started in 1942 as far as you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3817">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="3818">And that was performed publicly before it was part of this other plan?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3821">A: That was performed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, and then it was performed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">auditorium</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">boy's home</span> that we circled there, next to the town's square.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3823">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="3824">Did you also go to performances of other groups, as well as being in rehearsals, or did you [indecipherable] too much?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3827">A: I -- I did, but not too many, because I was -- I -- I f -- I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabarets</span> because that was really important to -- you know, when you are -- when you are under the -- somebody's</sentence><sentence id="3829">7 thumb, if you can play a trick on him, makes you happy.</sentence><sentence id="3830">So be -- being part of this -- this verbal dart throwing gave you even more an uplift than -- than -- than the singing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3837">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="3838">Really?</sentence><sentence id="3839">Did you -- did you go to <span class="BUILDING">lectures</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4754">A: I still mention, I don't have any complexes that he would have found in me a -- a level companion, cause I was a young guy, and his circle were the musi -- social circle were the musicians, the composers, and he had other interests.</sentence><sentence id="4755">But we were very close, and very good, and --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4780">A: -- during the day we were both working, and then -- he then became part of that free time department.</sentence><sentence id="4781">And I think his assignment, his job was working within this department so he didn't have to go somewhere to a -- I don't know <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span>, or whatever he worked in in that.</sentence><sentence id="4782">So that was his day job.</sentence><sentence id="4783">And then in the evening, after everybody finished, they came for rehearsal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4788">Q: So did he tell you ver -- talk to you about wanting to do the Verdi Requiem?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4832">A: No, I just felt I'm part of a group that despises the Germans and the Nazis, and that this is the best we can do to get even with them within our capabilities.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4834">Q: What was the -- were the rehearsals more intense than when you did "The Bartered Bride," and "The Magic Flute," and "The Marriage of Figaro"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4836">A: It was, because it was a different language, and it was much more difficult music.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4838">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4840">A: And much more concentration was required.</sentence><sentence id="4841">And some people who didn't work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, were not so well-fed to really dedicate themselves to such a -- that was a hard --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4906">Q: Was Schacter worried that he was going to be deported at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4916">A: Not that I knew, but those people who put together the transport list had some kind of directives whom to leave out, as long as it was possible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4918">Q: And as far as you know, who was it who put together these transport lists?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4920">A: There was a department, it was called evidence.</sentence><sentence id="4921">Evidence is where all the files about every single one who came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> was kept.</sentence><sentence id="4922">A card with a name, with a transport, date of birth, a transport when they came in, and -- and also the transporting date when they left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4923">I did after the war search, y -- my parents survived, in spite of Schliesser being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and myself, my parents survived.</sentence><sentence id="4924">I thought the easiest thing would have been if he had written on top of the card -- of their card, do not deport it, initial it, that would have been the easiest.</sentence><sentence id="4925">I got copies of those cards, there's nothing there, and I was researching how he did it, because he must have done it, because it's inconceivable that two, old, useless people would stay there, especially before the Red Cross came, they deported a lot of old people, they wanted only -- they wanted the Red Cross only to see young, good looking people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4932">Q: Maybe there was a special <span class="INT_SPACE">section</span> for cards, a different <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5091">A: So he didn't want it.</sentence><sentence id="5092">But then came the order from camp commander, that he wants a performance of the Requiem for high SS officials who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, to shake the hands of the Red Cross people who were also invited -- no Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>

second shot, that the guy must have had it, you know, but -- so when the column past, I suddenly had strength to pick myself up, and went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and found like minded people, other prisoners who escaped, having been lucky, not getting shot.</sentence><sentence id="6481">So we huddled together and used the blanket in ma -- <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in -- in January in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with this -- just a cotton uniform, and I think we all slept, sitting, holding each other.</sentence><sentence id="6482">And in the morning we went to the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, that the <span class="DLF">road</span> we came from, looking whether we find a sign where we are, what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="6483">And we see the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence

front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6489">And of course they didn't want to be caught by the Russians, so they jumped in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and left in a

said, "Where were you located?"</sentence><sentence id="6492">Sort of the last <span class="DLF">block</span>, because that was the last group that arrived there.</sentence><sentence id="6493">And I found the two kids there, and we started to look for food, but we didn't find any, because those who were there already, they plundered the -- the -- the potato storage, and all -- all other <span class="INT_SPACE">storages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6494">But somebody told us there's, on the side the <span class="DLF">road</span>, is a abandoned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the German population ran the same way as the SS, and there's food in their <span class="INT_SPACE">pantries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6495">So we went there, not far, and there's food.</sentence><sentence id="6496">Everything except bread.</sentence><sentence id="6497">They must have taken the loaf and bread and ran.</sentence><sentence id="6498">The speed at which they ran wa -- showed itself.</sentence><sentence id="6499">That was unfinished food, even unfinished food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, and the rest was burned in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>, or on top of the <span class="DLF">range</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6500">So we had food, and there was no -- at that time there was no

that's how you kill pigs.</sentence><sentence id="6652">But the hammer was small, and I was not strong enough yet, and when you hit them here, it swells up and you can never break his skull any
