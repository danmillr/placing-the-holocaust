I'd like to ask you when you were born and where.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: I wa--I was born on the fifth of February, 1922 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: Of the 86 people who were in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop</span>, I know of three who changed -- who -- who took their old name back.</sentence><sentence id="20">Most of us got used to the new names and identities</sentence><sentence id="22">Interview with Peter Masters , August 7, 1998 very quickly and we -- we looked upon this, unless we were attached to the former name, unless they were ancient family names, or this or that, the motivation to go back to the original name didn't exist for many of us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: What languages did you speak in 1945?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: What name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: What languages?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: What languages.</sentence><sentence id="35">Well, I was born w -- my -- my original language was the Austrian version of German, which incidentally has always been a little bone of contention between Germans and Austrians.</sentence><sentence id="36">Austrians feel that the only correct and proper German is spoken in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> make the same claim.</sentence><sentence id="37"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, for instance, han -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, they think that's -- they also think that the claims by the others are absurd, and -- and funny.</sentence><sentence id="38">I learnt a little French as a small child, we had a French teacher, a Madame come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and -- and purportedly teach us French, my sister and myself.</sentence><sentence id="39">It didn't really work, didn't go much beyond "Frere Jacques."</sentence><sentence id="40">And we didn't really like her; that didn't help.</sentence><sentence id="41">And -- however, when -- in my school system, we took a fir -- a foreign language from the age of 11, and I chose French.</sentence><sentence id="42">The teacher who taught French also taught German and was the fore-master of my class.</sentence><sentence id="43">So he was the administrative, disciplinary head of that class.</sentence><sentence id="44">And he wa -- turned out to be one of the well known arch-Nazis of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">A published author, who when the Austrian</sentence><sentence id="47">Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 writers club, the Pen Club, the International Pen Club, Austrian branch sent a telegram to their Jewish colleagues in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to express their sympathy upon their book burning and treatment, there were two Austrian authors who refused to sign the otherwise unanimous declaration, and he was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="48">I got barely passing grades in German, which was my best subject, and I switched to the English class because of him.</sentence><sentence id="49">Solely because of him.</sentence><sentence id="50">So I had four years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> English and I thought I spoke fluent English.</sentence><sentence id="51">That was disillusioned fairly quickly upon arrival in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, but I could get by fairly well.</sentence><sentence id="52">I learned a little Spanish before I left.</sentence><sentence id="53">This was really emigration learning other <span class="NPIP">things</span> type of thing.</sentence><sentence id="54">But I don't think there was enough of it to have any impact.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: Where were you on V-E day, when victory was declared in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Victory in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="80">I'm trying to think.</sentence><sentence id="81">The -- the -- strangely perhaps, the impact was not enormous on us because we had felt pretty solidly that we had won, so the -- the fact of the -- of it becoming official was relatively minor.</sentence><sentence id="82">The date, if I recall, was May -- May eight, May eight.</sentence><sentence id="83">At May eight, I believe I was in <span class="BUILDING">cadet school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and there was a little bit of razzmatazz of people celebrating, cheering, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="84">And it -- I think many of the cadets thought that now they were more likely to go to the <span class="REGION">Orient</span> than before.</sentence><sentence id="85">And that concerned me only marginally because I thought the British would surely send me somewhere where my fluent German would make sense.</sentence><sentence id="86">I -- I made some halfhearted efforts to get sent to</sentence><sentence id="88">Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> because that would have interested me, and besides, being to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for the first time ever, during the fighting, and I had a distaste for going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">Some of our people were there and sort of lived it up in occupation, but didn't attract me.</sentence><sentence id="90">The -- the -- the problem as to -- who was and who wasn't a Nazi and so on had already come up when -- when we were fighting in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">And I was told that chances of getting to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> were minimal because they were being supplied from central Mediterranean forces, meaning from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, whereas <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was being supplied by personnel from <span class="REGION">northwest Europe</span>, from -- from our end.</sentence><sentence id="92">Th-The -- the army has its own ways and when it came up, where I did go was <span class="REGION">West Africa</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Before I have you going to <span class="REGION">West Africa</span>, can you tell me, in May of 1945, what was your rank, and what -- what action had you seen during the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: St-Starting at the beginning, when I was in the Pioneer corps, I was a private and I saw no chance of ever getting promoted to anything, because I was just one of the younger lads who was unloading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or testing bridging material and so on.</sentence><sentence id="112">And I --I wasn't one of the boot polisher and button polishers, so I-- I wasn't a standout to the people on the <span class="DLF">parade ground</span> by any means.</sentence><sentence id="113">In-In fact, I was a bit of a nonconformist [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="114">I was more likely to get in trouble about something than I was to get promoted.</sentence><sentence id="115">So, when I came to the commandos, just prior to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D-Day</span>, I was made a lance corporal, which was a big deal.</sentence><sentence id="116">It -- it's nothing</sentence><sentence id="118">Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 really, but as such I was the second in command of my detachment, a five man team, attached to number six commando, we were number 10 commando at- attaching teams to eight different commandos for D-Day.</sentence><sentence id="119">So, I was a lance corporal and was subsequently promoted to be a corporal in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, which caused a little argument because | said to my colleague and sergeant, who said, I'm making you a corporal and I said, you know, jokingly, want me to stitch on an extra stripe here in -- in the <span class="DLF">front line</span>?</sentence><sentence id="120">And he said, you're damn right.</sentence><sentence id="121">And I said I-- you -- you mean you have the authority to make me a paid corporal?</sentence><sentence id="122">And he said, who said anything about paid?</sentence><sentence id="123">And I came back as a corporal, largely because one of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">detachments</span> had been wiped out and I became a one man detachment.</sentence><sentence id="124">When I came back I was promoted to sergeant and when we went out to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> again, I was a sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="125">And it was then that one of our own, who had been -- who -- who had become the commanding officer of our detachments, Kurt Gowza(ph) who served under the name of James Griffith, wanted to send me to <span class="BUILDING">cadet school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">And I said, at this stage, it's late in the war, do you think it's worthwhile?</sentence><sentence id="127">And I don't want to do the parade square bashing and -- and -- and pamphlet bullshitting, I just don't want to do it.</sentence><sentence id="128">And he persuaded me to do it, with the help of the brigade major, Sir Maxwell Hopagow(ph).</sentence><sentence id="129">He -- they -- they li-- I wanted to talk to the brigadier, if -- if -- if a commission then happened in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, Montgomery was against commissions in the <span class="DLF">field</span> unless from dire need, casualties, because he said it leads</sentence><sentence id="131">Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 to fraternization through the enlisted men.</sentence><sentence id="132">Which we thought was just fine, and he apparently as a [indecipherable] thought was in -- improper.</sentence><sentence id="133">This is sort of regular army smokiness, you know, and -- and he s -- he stopped quite -- quite a few of us got commissions in the <span class="DLF">field</span> because they were doing a good job.</sentence><sentence id="134">And I -- I fairly likely m-might have gotten one, but when I was transferred from one unit to the other, I had to start from square one to build my reputation of being keen and determined and willing to do anything and so on.</sentence><sentence id="135">Which I did.</sentence><sentence id="136">And it led to the i-- the notion of going to <span class="BUILDING">cadet school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">I went to <span class="BUILDING">cadet school</span>, and I must say I had a ball.</sentence><sentence id="138">The fact that I-- I m-- I remember arriving and there were a whole bunch of youngsters out of -- out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who were going to <span class="BUILDING">cadet school</span> and they were studying pamphlets.</sentence><sentence id="139">And they ask questions from the pamphlets and I had no idea what th-the answers were, b-but I said, I don't know the name of the plunger of the -- this weapon, but we had a rather specialized version of that weapon for a special operation.</sentence><sentence id="140">Then suddenly everybody is listening and they want to know.</sentence><sentence id="141">Well, when it came to the tests, the same thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="142">Some -- some weapon sergeant would ask questions and say, ask me about the Sten gun.</sentence><sentence id="143">| said, Sten gun was not a commando weapon, we used Thompsons, which are a higher quality.</sentence><sentence id="144">And the only Sten gun I've ever seen was one -- a special one for an operation with a silencer.</sentence><sentence id="145">He said, a--a Sten with a silencer?</sentence><sentence id="146">I've never seen one.</sentence><sentence id="147">Tell me about it.</sentence><sentence id="148">I said, I'll draw you a picture.</sentence><sentence id="149">And we talked about the Sten with the silencer for the rest of</sentence><sentence id="151">Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 the examination.</sentence><sentence id="152">He said, I assume you were a weapons instructor.</sentence><sentence id="153">I said, I'm not supposed to comment.</sentence><sentence id="154">You abandon your rank when you are a -- a cadet.</sentence><sentence id="155">But some lance corporal who was -- had the job of taking the stripes off, relished to take a sergeants stripes off, you see, so he had slashed the sleeve of my best uniform and there were cuts where my stripes had been.</sentence><sentence id="156">And the weapon instructor sergeant who was doing the testing assumed -- he could see I'd been a sergeant by -- by the cuts on my arm.</sentence><sentence id="157">Well, I--I breezed through this whole thing like nobody's business and then -- then came to <span class="BUILDING">cadet school</span>, and there I was quite determined to be a nonconformist and a rebel when nonsense was being talked about, you know, pamphlet stuff, and -- which often is -- is outdated and -- and -- and has been written, who knows for whom, and -- and I would -- I would say -- well, for instance a question.</sentence><sentence id="158">What use is the <span class="BUILDING">Bren gun carrier</span>?</sentence><sentence id="159">Hands go up and the cadets -- the cadet kept asking questions, you see.</sentence><sentence id="160">And they said, to carry out flanking attacks, and somebody else said something else, and when it was my turn, I said none.</sentence><sentence id="161">The Bren gun carrier is no use.</sentence><sentence id="162">I have seen more burnt out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bren gun carriers</span> than -- than non- burned out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bren gun carriers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">It's a little [indecipherable] not enough armament.</sentence><sentence id="164">And I said, it is useful possibly for two things, which is to bring up the tea after battle, or if you have nothing and want to fake like you have armor, you run them off somewhere where nobody can see them and the enemy will think you're coming with a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, because they make such a racket that they inevitably get shot at</sentence><sentence id="166">Interview with Peter Masters me August 7, 1998 and -- and -- and then that's when they burn.</sentence><sentence id="167">And the instructor said, th-that Masters is absolutely right, because he had just come back from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> himself, so he knew what I am saying is true, you see?</sentence><sentence id="168">So -- so after awhile I found out wasn't that much --I mean, I wa -- it wasn't working the way I had thought.</sentence><sentence id="169">I -- I thought I'd be a rebel and I found the management agreed with me.</sentence><sentence id="170">Which was in a way, of course, a big help and gratifying and so I graduated very high in my class, and that's the end of that one.</sentence><sentence id="171">Tha -- you asked me what rank I was when I graduated.</sentence><sentence id="172">I was, of course, a second lieutenant and was subsequently promoted during my service in <span class="REGION">Africa</span>, aut -- almost automatically to first lieutenant and then my time was up.</sentence><sentence id="173">Six years.</sentence><sentence id="174">It was age plus length of service in the British army.</sentence><sentence id="175">So my number was up and I -- somebody wanted me to stay as an instructor at the school of infantry and I said thank you but no thank you.</sentence><sentence id="176">Why not?</sentence><sentence id="177">Well, I said, In --1--I---I relish the illusion of freedom, that I can go wherever I want, whenever I want and not be sent.</sentence><sentence id="178">I've been sent for a number of years now.</sentence><sentence id="179">So even bef -- realizing it's an illusion, enough.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: While you were serving in Europe, did you have the opportunity to visit or to see any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Never saw one.</sentence><sentence id="256">Some of -- few of us did.</sentence><sentence id="257">This really depended on what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> you were with, and -- and -- and chance.</sentence><sentence id="258">And you have to bear in mind, commandos were essentially assault units.</sentence><sentence id="259">And then they -- th-the -- the people in charge always</sentence><sentence id="261">Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 stretched what was an initial assault way beyond our normal role, because we didn't have heavy support weapons, you know.</sentence><sentence id="262">But they had us, so they kept us.</sentence><sentence id="263">And if you didn't happen -- well, it -- it just so happened that no concentrat-tration camp was in the path of where they wanted a -- a-a-a -- an assault made.</sentence><sentence id="264">These were usually <span class="DLF">river crossings</span> that they used us for, after the -- the initial landings at -- on D-Day or in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or in <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">So, one of our people of course, as you know, heard his parents might be alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> and went to -- to go -- go get them, and succeeded.</sentence><sentence id="266">That was extremely gratifying.</sentence><sentence id="267">None of us, the rest of us even have the slightest opportunity to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: When the war in Europe was over, did you make any attempts to find people that were left behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, when you had left?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: I didn't understand that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: When the war was over, did you make any attempts to find any family or friends that were left behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orndorf(ph</span>), yes.</sentence><sentence id="289">It seemed hopeless the immediate family insofar as they have not gotten out.</sentence><sentence id="290">We knew that my -- my -- my grandfather was murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we knew that were a number of distant relatives had -- had -- had perished.</sentence><sentence id="291">And other than looking for individual friends here and there, and -- and fi --si--- later finding some, not very much finding materialized.</sentence><sentence id="292">There were things like getting in touch again with people who had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">Friends.</sentence><sentence id="294">Getting in touch</sentence><sentence id="296">Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 again with such people as my kinderfraulein, my nanny in -- in -- in -- in-- who had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> throughout the war.</sentence><sentence id="297">In fact, we invited her to come and visit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and that was very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="298">So, not much in the way of -- of finding people that had -- that had disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="299">There were some weird things.</sentence><sentence id="300">My -- my mother lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and once went to a neighbor to borrow some wrapping paper for a package she had to make in a hurry.</sentence><sentence id="301">And the woman said, well, I have this one, you can turn it over, it's used.</sentence><sentence id="302">And on the reverse side were names and addresses of my father's nephew -- two of my father's nephews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">Since my parents were divorced, my mother never pursued that.</sentence><sentence id="304">And I tried much later to see what I could find it, found some people by this un -- very unusual name in -- in the telephone directory and called them up and they said, it's just a name we call our firm, and there's no one here by that name.</sentence><sentence id="305">But, it went off into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span>, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="306">Of course, you know, people still appear nowadays here and there, and that could theoretically happen.</sentence><sentence id="307">My --I--- I'm --I'm still looking for some of my classmates and when I came to Europe | used to read the telephone books wherever I was, to see what I could find.</sentence><sentence id="308">And sometimes I'd find a name and sometimes I'd pursue it and call up for some classmate or other, and not find them at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="309">And it never really led anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="310">If I came back a few years later and looked in the phone book again, maybe a name was missing and I assumed the person died, or moved.</sentence><sentence id="311">So it -- not -- not -- not very much.</sentence><sentence id="314">Interview with Peter Masters 8 August 7, 1998 And by now, anyone older than I is likely to be dead.</sentence><sentence id="315">I mean, purely, technically, you know, you -- I-I'm 76 years old.</sentence><sentence id="316">If I start thinking in terms of people who were older -- substantially older, 86 years old, how many are there, you know?</sentence><sentence id="317">So you -- you find that -- that some of this is -- is quite -- quite hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="318">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> just now, a friend of mine whom I haven't seen since 1940-something, actually came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> to spend the day with me and we talked all day long about the old times.</sentence><sentence id="319">He was especially good friend.</sentence><sentence id="320">I would never have -- I would never have recognized him in -- in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, or [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="321">And -- but -- but we had so many common memories that there was no shortage of material to talk about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: Before I ask you about your service in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span>, which I will do in a minute, I wanted to ask you, when did you realize the full extent of the genocide in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: This is a question I -- that is very difficult, and I have asked myself that, because no-- many a time still, it's very, very hard to answer, because the fact that people were being killed became known almost immediately.</sentence><sentence id="360">And by that I mean the anschluss was in 12" of March 1938.</sentence><sentence id="361">At that time people were arbitrarily arrested.</sentence><sentence id="362">The brutality in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was much more immediate than the gradual tightening of the noose in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">Which of course was a good thing, except if it happened to you.</sentence><sentence id="364">A good thing in that it scared you into action, which it didn't do for many people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because it just got a little worse all the time.</sentence><sentence id="365">Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span></sentence><sentence id="367">Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 the brutality was immediate and many people said, let's get out of here and --a-- or, any <span class="DLF">border</span>, quick.</sentence><sentence id="368">And not enough people said that and -- and -- but -- but those who did benefited from that scenario.</sentence><sentence id="369">Oh, people were arrested and in the beginning one asked naively, why were they arrested.</sentence><sentence id="370">And then there were some black humor jests.</sentence><sentence id="371">They were arrested because they had eggs for breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="372">You know, the people were still joking about this sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="373">And then some of these neighbors or friends who had been arrested, actually were released.</sentence><sentence id="374">And some of them were in very poor condition, having been beaten and goodness knows what.</sentence><sentence id="375">So [indecipherable] became aware that people were being tortured or beaten.</sentence><sentence id="376">And then in some cases one heard that the family received an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urn</span> with ashes, saying, shot while trying to escape.</sentence><sentence id="377">Well, shot while trying to escape.</sentence><sentence id="378">If this was some very peaceable neighbor, you know -- knew them well, that this was not a man who was going to escape from -- from benevolent detention.</sentence><sentence id="379">So there began to materialize a certain awe of, are they coming for me, if they're coming for me, what will happen to me?</sentence><sentence id="380">Are they coming for my relatives?</sentence><sentence id="381">Should one work more actively on getting out, and -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="382">And this is -- was a gradually increasing image, and I have a memory.</sentence><sentence id="383">I haven't researched this, but I have a memory that there -- I went to the movies once in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and there was a movie -- there's -- there was a group, you know, like the Stoogies, called The Crazy Gang.</sentence><sentence id="384">Funny people in -- you know, in -- in -- movie comedians.</sentence><sentence id="385">And the thing was called, The Crazy Gang in a</sentence><sentence id="387">Interview with Peter Masters (r) August 7, 1998 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concentration Camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">Now, that's appalling, isn't it?</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="934">Q: What marketable skills did you have at the end of your military service?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="936">A: Ha, what marketable skills.</sentence><sentence id="937">I had strong cartoons in the army, and I had an older mentor who was a stage designer.</sentence><sentence id="938">And he advised me what to do with my cartoons, which he liked very much.</sentence><sentence id="939">And I had an interview with "Punch."</sentence><sentence id="940">He said, you start at the top.</sentence><sentence id="941">I said, you mean at the bottom?</sentence><sentence id="942">He said no, at the top.</sentence><sentence id="943">If you can't hack it, you go down one rung.</sentence><sentence id="944">Wisdom.</sentence><sentence id="945">Well, they bought two ideas for cartoons and I was so rich that I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="946">But this is before the commandos and the</sentence><sentence id="948">Interview with Peter Masters *s August 7, 1998 Pioneer corps.</sentence><sentence id="949">I-I got paid like for several months salary for two ideas.</sentence><sentence id="950">And I thought this is a lovely way of making a living.</sentence><sentence id="951">These were not political cartoons, they were like "New Yorker" type cartoons.</sentence><sentence id="952">And I drew another batch and I said I would throw a party for the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span>, and the -- nothing seemed to happen and then a terrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="953">Well, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">local pub</span> where I was well known and I said, I-I must give this party.</sentence><sentence id="954">I have a whole batch of cartoons out there and when they come in I'Il have plenty of money and right now I don't.</sentence><sentence id="955">And they gave me credit and I threw a party, all the beer you can drink for the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="956">And the check hadn't come yet, th-the second installment, but after the party, I think one or two days later, it came saying the editor regrets at this time we are not buying any of the cartoons.</sentence><sentence id="957">And now I had absolutely six months to pay it off, you see.</sentence><sentence id="958">And I didn't draw a cartoon for a year and a half, in utter depression.</sentence><sentence id="959">Now, I still thought that in that direction was my -- my -- my future profession.</sentence><sentence id="960">I came out of the army and I made one brief attempt.</sentence><sentence id="961">I talked to a friend of my family's who was a--as-- journalist.</sentence><sentence id="962">And she wrote things about <span class="BUILDING">resorts</span> who then gave her a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousine</span>, and you know the bit.</sentence><sentence id="963">One of my daughters says it's half a step from prostitution, not journalism, but that's a matter of t-- personal taste.</sentence><sentence id="964">Anyhow, I asked her, do you think there would be some opening as an apprentice journalist somewhere?</sentence><sentence id="965">And she said no, completely hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="966">You might sell one story about your war experience, maybe, but doesn't amount to much, everybody has stories.</sentence><sentence id="967">And I gave up.</sentence><sentence id="968">She's</sentence><sentence id="970">Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 still writing a --a Austrian cooking column for a Jewish magazine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, very popular.</sentence><sentence id="971">Written several books, still going to all the best <span class="BUILDING">resorts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="972">Well, I thought -- I --I---I wrote her a note when my -- when my book came out, and the movie rights were bought.</sentence><sentence id="973">I haven't heard from her since.</sentence><sentence id="974">Anyhow, I gave up and I decided reluctantly I would have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="975">So, my mentor, who had sent me with the cartoons, you know, to "Punch," he said, I have a young woman friend who has just graduated from <span class="BUILDING">art school</span>, and she said she would be willing to come and meet with you and advise you which <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to go to and so on.</sentence><sentence id="976">So we met in his <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> and she [indecipherable] sort of snippety, brisk young woman, and she said, I went to the Central School of Art and Crafts, it's -- I consider it the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">It's very hard to get in and you probably won't.</sentence><sentence id="978">And sh --I--I--I said, you -- you've graduated from there?</sentence><sentence id="979">Yes, she had graduated from there, and she was a German refugee and she had been president of the student union, an <span class="BUILDING">elective office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="980">Not bad for a -- for a refugee.</sentence><sentence id="981">Well, I was this commando first lieutenant, you see, and I decided to go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and become president of the student union, as a matter of -- point of honor, you see?</sentence><sentence id="982">And I did both.</sentence><sentence id="983">I--I daresay my jingling uniform helped a bit to boost my portfolio, but it -- they accepted me and I went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I learned quite a lot.</sentence><sentence id="984">And after three years, my mother drew my attention to a middle paragraph in a paper that talked about Fulbright scholarships.</sentence><sentence id="985">And she said, wouldn't a graduate year be very beneficial for your career?</sentence><sentence id="986">Well, I had just</sentence><sentence id="988">Interview with Peter Masters *deg August 7, 1998 begun to go and look for jobs and I found they paid nothing and wanted me to do things that I was not willing to do.</sentence><sentence id="989">1-- I1-- I asked one <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> where I went for a job, what would I have to show you that you would hire me?</sentence><sentence id="990">And they produced an extremely realistic painting of a plate of bacon and eggs, wi-with fat bubble in the center, and very real.</sentence><sentence id="991">And that's an illustrator, you know, I mean, I -- obviously whoever was talking to me didn't understand where I came from or didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="992">Anyway, I --I said to myself, I shall never be able to do this and what's more I don't want to be able to do that.</sentence><sentence id="993">I'm a problem solver, I'm a designer, I-- "m a-- and for that they were willing to pay, I think, three pounds a week starting salary, and I --I thought that that was absolutely horrible.</sentence><sentence id="994">And I welcomed the opportunity to apply for the scholarship, for the Fulbright.</sentence><sentence id="995">And I did with full support of the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, a -- a--a Scottish painter who was not my friends because as president of the student union, you can imagine we had many, many skirmishes.</sentence><sentence id="996">But he said, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is entering what we entered in the first Elizabethan age, culturally, and you must go there.</sentence><sentence id="997">And o-off I went and they threw in a summer scholarship at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span>, six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="998">And money was a problem, because sterling was not converted -- not that I had any.</sentence><sentence id="999">But i-it -- it created a problem, because most <span class="BUILDING">art schools</span> are not <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1000">So I had to live somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1001">So I lived at <span class="BUILDING">International House</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, in the cheapest <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, and developed techniques, how to eat for little or nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1002">I was also helped by the fact that my mother had a couple of</sentence><sentence id="1004">Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 cousins where I was invited to dinner once a week and they'd give me sandwiches for the next couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="1005">And then I'd buy a box of cereal and I'd buy a loaf of bread.</sentence><sentence id="1006">And I couldn't afford the <span class="BUILDING">school cafeteria</span>, but I could buy 20 cents worth of bologna or cheese, and that would stretch for a couple of meals with my loaf of bread.</sentence><sentence id="1007">And as to -- and -- and a carton of milk, which I put on the <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> to -- to keep cool.</sentence><sentence id="1008">A-And -- and I discovered the American luxury, there's free sugar in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span>, where you can help yourself, put a couple of packages in your -- in your pocket and with my box of cereal I had breakfast every morning, and my carton of milk, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1009">And it -- it worked.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And I started to freelance.</sentence><sentence id="1011">There was a woman who did [indecipherable] greeting cards, and I did the finished drawings.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Making the bells on the wedding cards nice and oval, the polka dots round.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And listening to these -- the radio programs of the day, like the trace of lost persons, the FBI and peace and war.</sentence><sentence id="1014">I got a whole education.</sentence><sentence id="1015">And I worked there some nights a week.</sentence><sentence id="1016">And then the father of a schoolmate of mine from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had a business of embroidering blouses, women's blouses.</sentence><sentence id="1017">And he -- he paid for these designs, lots of money.</sentence><sentence id="1018">And he didn't want them finished, he wanted them on tracing paper so he could

said to me -- he wrote me a letter and he said, I've read your book, and you're not supposed to enjoy a book about such grim times and experiences.</sentence><sentence id="1359">But you and I know that in between the grim times and experiences, we had some wonderful times.</sentence><sentence id="1360">So forget what I said about -- I really enjoyed your book, because it's like you were there, I mean, when you read it.</sentence><sentence id="1361">And so is his.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And he says, you know, D-Day wasn't so bad for us compared to what we experienced in the next few days afterwards, and that's true.</sentence><sentence id="1363">But in describing his D-Day, he tells me where -- you see, he was -- he had a disadvantage over me.</sentence><sentence id="1364">He was surrounded by all the people with whom he had trained.</sentence><sentence id="1365">I was one of me attached to people I barely knew.</sentence><sentence id="1366">A training mistake, they should have put me with them earlier.</sentence><sentence id="1367">But, when they were killed, I didn't know them.</sentence><sentence id="1368">When his buddies were killed, and one was like shot in half crossing a <span class="DLF">road</span> in front of him, these were his friends.</sentence><sentence id="1369">So it was much more personal for him, a-and I respect that, I mean I -- I never saw one

been killed, you know, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1376">I don't see them.</sentence><sentence id="1377">And I was Tommy gun guard for a burial party that buried, I don't know, 40 people.</sentence><sentence id="1378">I didn't know any of them.</sentence><sentence id="1379">So it -- it-- you know, these are all factors in this thing, it's a very, very personal the

the</sentence><sentence id="1442">4 Interview with Peter Masters August 7, 1998 notion that -- that <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> -- that -- that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> came into existence, and I have mentioned to you before my Scottish principal with whom I used to skirmish in <span class="BUILDING">art school</span>, and I remember that I was in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when the assassination of Count Bernadotte came th-through -- the news came through.</sentence><sentence id="1443">And I said, I'm shocked about that, one should not kill United Nations officials.</sentence><sentence id="1444">I-I think that's beyond the pale.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And he said, to my utter amazement, these are the birth pains of a new <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span>, and you have to accept it, that this is the sort of thing, we don't know the details.</sentence><sentence id="1446">And later of course, I heard that Bernadotte was targeted because he was assuming a stance of a very unfavorable [indecipherable] and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1447">But I was amazed that this Scotsman had the vision to s -- way beyond mine, that this was a thing you had to take into your stride.</sentence><sentence id="1448">Anti-Semitism, which is coming back to early Christian, didn't affect, but you have to bear in mind that all our chaps had cover stories and many of them found the [indecipherable] of that cover story was comfortable, and so they didn't say who they were.</sentence><sentence id="1449">Many of them didn't practice any religion particularly, and when it came to intermarriage, all of us were independent enough to say if I want marry an Eskimo, I will.</sentence><sentence id="1450">Metaphorically speaking, quite a few married Eskimos, which some of them came to regret.</sentence><sentence id="1451">But that doesn't alter the fact that on principle, you felt, I'm my own person, I can do what I like.</sentence><sentence id="1452">Now comes the question which is probably down your list somewhere, of -- of h-how much did Judaism mean?</sentence><sentence id="1453">It's very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1454">On the one hand, some of</sentence><sentence id="1456">Interview with Peter Masters deg August 7, 1998 us had a reaction, saying I don't want to belong to anything that excludes somebody.</sentence><sentence id="1457">That's a very broad statement, but -- but i-it's meant to be.</sentence><sentence id="1458">I don't want to belong to a <span

[indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1462">But it goes beyond that, because you say, if I send my children to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>, or they belong to a club, I don't want to join any clubs.</sentence><sentence id="1463">Clubs segregate.</sentence><sentence id="1464">That's not always reasonable, but that's an emotional reaction to some of the things that have happened before.</sentence><sentence id="1465">So you see, we did not send in our children to -- to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1466">I had two daughters and a son.</sentence><sentence id="1467">We had the son, the son was Bar Mitzvahed.</sentence><sentence id="1468">The girls were not Bat Mitzvahed because we hadn't even heard of that in

absurd if you reflect upon it, and it's taken me years to -- to -- to overcome it.</sentence><sentence id="1473">But -- but it was a very real factor, possibly an error, socially, possibly an error religiously, because parallel to that are the war memories of going to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> with my grandfather, who was very, very serious about it, as my parents were not.</sentence><sentence id="1474">And the tug of war between the sentiment an -- of emotional tradition on the one hand, and the not wanting to belong to anything that excludes anybody else is an ongoing thing.</sentence><sentence id="1475">Right now I'm deeply</sentence><sentence id="1477">Interview with Peter Masters 8 August 7, 1998 embroiled in a fight that I find myself in, rather surprisingly.</sentence><sentence id="1478">It is that the members of my troop of -- of foreign refugees, want to put up a memorial to the troop and the 20 who were killed in <span class="REGION">north Wales</span> where we were trained.</sentence><sentence id="1479">This is all initiated by my book, where it suddenly has sort of come to -- come alive, and a retired judge who was one of us, refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, has taken the ball and is running with it like crazy, and the people in <span class="REGION">north Wales</span> think that the movie will be made in -- in <span class="REGION">north Wales</span>, which of course doesn't follow.</sentence><sentence id="1480">But -- so the local council and the council of Wales is all in favor and has given us a lovely little green plot overlooking the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span>, where they are going to put up a <span class="DLF">memorial</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1481">And when they drafted the words, it said, refugees from Nazi oppression.</sentence><sentence id="1482">It did not use the word Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And I'm up in arms, and I say it has to include the word at least mostly Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1484">And in order to bring this about, I am fighting tooth and nail, I'm -- I'm enlisting the support of my surviving colleagues or their widows.</sentence><sentence id="1485">I sought an interview with the Honorable Miriam Rothschild, who was married to one of our chaps and is a wealthy ma -- scientist in her 90's.</sentence><sentence id="1486">And she said, you must come down and talk about it, and I just now I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Rothschild estate</span> and we spent all day talking and she is solidly on my side.</sentence><sentence id="1487">And the -- the thing that's happening is that some of the chaps who have embraced their cover story, don't want to break that cover story.</sentence><sentence id="1488">It is as if they thought that the York massacre, of which they have never heard, happened last year rather than hundreds of years</sentence><sentence id="1490">Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 ago, and that by assuming the -- their identities as British citizens church of England, which is what our dog tags said, they are escaping any danger of anti- Semitism and they have forgotten who they really are.</sentence><sentence id="1491">Or rather, they would like to forget.</sentence><sentence id="1492">Not all of them.</sentence><sentence id="1493">Some of the non-Jewish members of the troop, there is a--a --a fellow, he is now in his 80s, friend of mine, who -- whose name is Gizer(ph), he served under the name of Gordon.</sentence><sentence id="1494">He is a grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph).Walter Liebknecht(ph) was the buddy and companion of Rosa Luxemburg, if that means anything to you, early German communism.</sentence><sentence id="1495">His father, the son of Walter Liebknecht(ph) -- Walter Liebknecht(ph) was assassinated by forerunners of the Nazis in the 20s.</sentence><sentence id="1496">There is a Kathe Kollwitz woodcut, a gorgeous woodcut of the -- the body of Walter Liebknecht(ph) and mourners.</sentence><sentence id="1497">She was very much involved in that, Kathe Kollwitz.</sentence><sentence id="1498">Well, the grandson of Walter Liebknecht(ph), not Jewish, said there is not a drop of Jewish club in -- blood in me, but I respect, applaud and salute my Jewish comrades and their bravery and I am on your side that it should say mostly Jewish on the monument.</sentence><sentence id="1499">Another one, Ron Gilbert Goodman, he served in undercover intelligence in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after his command of duty.</sentence><sentence id="1500">He got an MBE, Member of the British Empire in -- from -- from the queen, and he said -- he maintained his cover longer than anybody, because he had to.</sentence><sentence id="1501">He was -- he was catching Nazis, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1502">Post-war Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1503">And he said -- it was a bit embarrassing because he's -- he's widowed, his girlfriend wanted to read the book and he thought</sentence><sentence id="1505">Interview with Peter Masters * August 7, 1998 well, that will break my cover as far as she's concerned.</sentence><sentence id="1506">But while he -- they were discussing it, she got it from Amazon dot com and read it and -- and he said, the hell with the cover, I'm on your side.</sentence><sentence id="1507">He remembers that he was forced to destroy his <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>, by the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1508">So you see, for the judge, it's probably very difficult to go to the Welsh council and say, on reflection, it ought to say mostly Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1509">And I don't know whether he's man enough to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1510">But if he isn't, I'1l withdraw my support.</sentence><sentence

time.</sentence><sentence id="1816">I had -- there was no G.I. bill, but there was a so-called further education and training grant, which was more modest than the G.I. bill, but it certainly sustained me together with my freelance activities.</sentence><sentence id="1817">And I had my -- my own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">southwest

id="1825">Where I'm well, there is my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, applies to some extent.</sentence><sentence id="1826">I could live in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> easily, but I

find it distressing.</sentence><sentence id="1829">I would say it includes <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1830">I've been to <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> once to a

England</span>, I -- I --I never really worked in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, other than on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> as a boy, which did me a lot of good, and briefly on being released from internment -- I did not go from internment into the army, I went from internment to being released, forgotten out momentarily, and then into the army, when I was old enough.</sentence><sentence id="1833">I -- I worked for a Polish publisher, and I was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1834">I mean, I was a gopher.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And I have therefore, no work experience in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that could be called a work experience.</sentence><sentence id="1836">The -- the thing about the bacon and eggs picture turned me off rather

where I understand you can get a job.</sentence><sentence id="1845">People ga -- actually do that.</sentence><sentence id="1846">They don't do it elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1847">And most of all, I realize that in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, if something bothers you and you are willing to spend some time trying to remedy it -- it needn't be a very political thing, it can be the bumps on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, or -- or the speed limit, or whether your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> needs an addition.</sentence><sentence id="1848">You don't have to -- to -- to give up your job to -- to pursue this.</sentence><sentence id="1849">You work on in a little bit and then get together with a few people who are like-minded.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And in your own lifetime -- even in -- within the next few years, something actually starts to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1851">Sometimes too fast.</sentence><sentence id="1852">I come back to the bumps where they -- they want the bumps in, then now they want the bumps out.</sentence><sentence id="1853">And when they're out they will want them in again.</sentence><sentence id="1854">You know, I mean, and -- and -- and that actually happens, at great expense and with a big effort.</sentence><sentence id="1855">But you try and do that in some other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and you

and</sentence><sentence id="1859">Interview with Peter Masters " August 7, 1998 there.</sentence><sentence id="1860">But by and large, you run your head up against a <span class="DLF">wall</span>, and the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, the base of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> is littered with the bleached bones of people who have tried before you, and some of them were good people, but they failed.</sentence><sentence id="1861">Well, that's a big discouragement to run your head against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1862">I have participated in some of these things in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1863">Got an addition built at the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> where my children went, which actually

id="1865">Doesn't -- doesn't happen, doesn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="1866">So I find it enormously refreshing, and you can take some of the other things in your stride a little bit if you know

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1923">Q: Let's go back to the 1950s and now you are living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1924">I would like to get a sense of what was happening in your life, now you're newly married and you are now in the Washington, D.C. area.</sentence><sentence id="1925">What was happening to you professionally and personally in the 1950s?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1929">A: I first g -- my -- my wife arranged that I should see a man who was himself a n-- a German refugee, and he re -- had a small public relations agency,

decided to employ me.</sentence><sentence id="1932">In some -- in many respects that was a disaster.</sentence><sentence id="1933">It was a very small firm, of more heads than employees.</sentence><sentence id="1934">And the attitude was rather peculiar.</sentence><sentence id="1935">I was now the art director and the art department all in</sentence></p><p><sentence

an assignment where I -- where there were to be free full page, full color ads in "Esquire" magazine.</sentence><sentence id="1941">I had never done anything like it, and neither had anybody else there.</sentence><sentence id="1942">So it was my assignment.</sentence><sentence id="1943">I not only designed them, I wrote them, I supervised the photography, I went into unbelievable acrobatics.</sentence><sentence id="1944">And they came out, for those times, pretty well.</sentence><sentence id="1945">One of the partners suggested that I be given a bonus, because I think I earned 30 dollars a week.</sentence><sentence id="1946">The big boss said, he is an artist and he had the fun of doing it, it's a bad idea to give him a bonus.</sentence><sentence id="1947">And they didn't.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1948">This kind of attitude made it a little difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1949">I-It was in everything.</sentence><sentence id="1950">I mean, if we did get money for this, there's no doubt we did, he would buy a new oriental rug for the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1951">And I designed a shiny brass nameplate for downstairs on [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">street</span> where we were -- had a -- had a <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs office</span> with a three- dimensional logo which I had designed in the

know?</sentence><sentence id="1953">And -- and the -- well, we went to a meeting for -- with -- with some corporate association, and I discovered the thing I mentioned elsewhere in -- in other connections, and that is that nobody was saying anything, and we were to sell these people on why we wanted to do this.</sentence><sentence id="1954">So I spoke up and I said, here's what we need to do.</sentence><sentence id="1955">We actually did a brochure for them.</sentence><sentence id="1956">That was unprecedented, and -- and i-it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't sold them on</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1959">Interview with Peter Masters *deg August 7, 1998 the concept, because it was way out modern for them at that time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1960">Well, ultimately everybody quit, and I was the sole employee.</sentence><sentence id="1961">The boss took a job with the government and said, don't ever call me there unless there's an utter emergency.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1962">And then he said, I see here an advertisement that the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> is -- wants to retain an agent, an advertising agency for the army.</sentence><sentence id="1963">So why don't you go and bid on that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1964">Me.</sentence><sentence id="1965">And I said, you know, tha-that's a bit absurd, because they are looking for a big corporation to handle this.</sentence><sentence id="1966">Never mind, you do as you're told.</sentence><sentence id="1967">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> and to this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of colonels and what have you and advertising agencies from all over the <span

said, we are disqualified because of this stipulation.</sentence><sentence id="1971">And he said why?</sentence><sentence id="1972">And I said, because if your <span class="BUILDING">business</span> is doubled.</sentence><sentence id="1973">He said, well, it would do much more than double our business, so we are all right.</sentence><sentence id="1974">And he was absolutely ser-serious, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1975">So I -- I -- he filled out the forms, I filled out the forms and he sent them in.</sentence><sentence id="1976">I was still the only employee.</sentence><sentence id="1977">After awhile there was -- the <span class="DLF">door</span> rang one day -- doorbell rang and it was a team to evaluate our facilities.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1978">That was rather

id="1988">These guys might come back any time, I -- they -- they don't -- I tried to pin them down, but they said they come for random inspection.</sentence><sentence id="1989">And he said, I'm coming over.</sentence><sentence id="1990">And he came and he said, you know, in -- we -- we have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="1991">And he said, I just crossed <span class="DLF">Lafayette

are coming again.</sentence><sentence id="1993">I-- I said, you know, I -- I don't think that that'1l work.</sentence><sentence id="1994">He was deadly serious.</sentence><sentence id="1995">Well, a short while later, he had the account of an African nation, and who was doing it?</sentence><sentence id="1996">I.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1997">We had a newsletter.</sentence><sentence id="1998">I had absolutely no material for the newsletter, but I went to the ambassador and interviewed him, and I went to look at the postage stamps of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and there -- there were some animals that were indigenous only to that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> and talked to the director about whether he had any of these specimen, and he did, and I had a photographer and I took pictures in the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span>, and pictures of the stamps and I got a congratulatory letter from a philatelist at the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span> saying I wish more people were doing this.</sentence><sentence id="1999">He didn't know I was</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2002">Interview with Peter Masters *deg August 7, 1998 doing it out of desperation, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2003">And then the boss was invited for the inauguration of the president in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and he went, and was decorated.</sentence><sentence id="2004">And I said, be sure to keep me informed so I can write the newsletter that should get to the guests before they go -- all go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2005">And he said he would, and he sent me nothing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2006">And I was getting progressively more desperate because I felt duty-bound to do this and I called his wife.</sentence><sentence id="2007">And I said, is he writing to you?</sentence><sentence id="2008">And she said yes.</sentence><sentence id="2009">I said, can I see the letters?</sentence><sentence id="2010">She said no, they are rather private.</sentence><sentence id="2011">I said, cross out the private things and -- and I -- I have to have something of what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="2012">Didn't get anything.</sentence><sentence id="2013">I finally took -- fished out accounts of the first inauguration.</sentence><sentence id="2014">This was a re-inauguration of a second term president, and I wrote as if somebody had been there, and if it described the -- the women's dresses in general terms, I described the women's dresses in general terms.</sentence><sentence id="2015">And I -- I -- I just winged the whole thing and -- and showed pictures of the previous inauguration.</sentence><sentence id="2016">And I had it all just about done, with each story on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and now all I had to do is assemble it, and he came back and he said, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> is in an awful mess.</sentence><sentence id="2017">And I said mess?</sentence><sentence id="2018">The mess is each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, since nobody sits at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span>, it's one story.</sentence><sentence id="2019">It's perfectly organized, I -- it's the only way I can get this thing out in time.</sentence><sentence id="2020">And he said, first we're going to get the <span class="NPIP">place</span> shipshape.</sentence><sentence id="2021">I said, you touch one of these stories, I-- I'm out of here.</sentence><sentence id="2022">He touched the stories, and I quit.</sentence><sentence id="2023">And then he wanted to pay me to come back to put out the issue, and so I -- but I mean, for the swan song, but I wa -- you know, there</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2026">Interview with Peter Masters ~ August 7, 1998 was simply no way.</sentence><sentence id="2027">So I called all the people who had quit before, half a dozen and one of them was working for channel nine television.</sentence><sentence id="2028">And he said, how would you like to be a television art director?</sentence><sentence id="2029">I said, well there's one catch, I know nothing about television.</sentence><sentence id="2030">He said, neither does anybody else, it's new.</sentence><sentence id="2031">Why don't you come on out, I can't promise anything, but we'll see.</sentence><sentence id="2032">I went out and I was television art director, and it was lots of fun.</sentence><sentence id="2033">Pioneers, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2034">Never before.</sentence><sentence id="2035">Live television.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2036">We did fantastic things.</sentence><sentence id="2037">We had more courage than good sense.</sentence><sentence id="2038">We -- we -- we did spectacular things, we got -- and being <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> we did network things, and I-I did presidential broadcasts for several presidents, some at the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span>, some in the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2039">I -- then -- then <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> did a survey and discovered that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was read for country music.</sentence><sentence id="2040">I think the survey meant Simon and Garfunkel, but they didn't understand that, and so we got Jimmy Dean.</sentence><sentence id="2041">And we did the Jimmy Dean show, network, and I had a ball.</sentence><sentence id="2042">I had a free hand to do what I like.</sentence><sentence id="2043">I did a network musical every week.</sentence><sentence id="2044">It meant not sleeping for one night, working clean acro -- around the clock.</sentence><sentence id="2045">And for couple of adjacent night, if we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by two or three in the morning, we were doing well.</sentence><sentence id="2046">And I decided I had to make a move financially, so I went to the management, which was as autocratic as they come, and I said, you are not charging enough for my services.</sentence><sentence id="2047">That was the approach.</sentence><sentence id="2048">And they said, how much should we be charging?</sentence><sentence id="2049">I said, well first of all, I'd like to have a percentage, like all the other talent is getting.</sentence><sentence id="2050">Oh really, how much do you have in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2053">Interview with Peter Masters degdeg August 7, 1998 mind?</sentence><sentence id="2054">So I-- my wife and I had a long session over the weekend, because if I said the right amount, they would cut it in half.</sentence><sentence id="2055">If I said too much they would laugh and fire me.</sentence><sentence id="2056">If I said not enough, they would accept it.</sentence><sentence id="2057">So I had to say too much, but just enough too much that by cutting it back it would be reasonable.</sentence><sentence id="2058">And that actually worked.</sentence><sentence id="2059">And it was based on the premise that the role of Washington television would increase.</sentence><sentence id="2060">I was much more optimistic than they were, and I was right.</sentence><sentence id="2061">The trouble was when I didn't get any sleep any more, I couldn't -- didn't have time to bill, so that my bills were accumulations of several weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2062">And that meant the check was large, and that meant the person who had to sign the check was signing a check that was bigger than his.</sentence><sentence id="2063">It wasn't really bigger than his, but it was by the fact that it was several weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2064">And that irked them.</sentence><sentence id="2065">So after a period of time, they said, we are going to terminate this agreement.</sentence><sentence id="2066">And I said, and what?</sentence><sentence id="2067">And they said, we'll -- we'll see that you are all right.</sentence><sentence id="2068">Well, seeing that was -- I was all right was a ludicrous joke compared to what I'd been earning.</sentence><sentence id="2069">So I said, I don't know whether that is acceptable.</sentence><sentence id="2070">So they said, do you want to see the president, whom we could never see.</sentence><sentence id="2071">I met him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> and usually told him what -- what -- what I -- what I needed and he would support me, because I was an asset.</sentence><sentence id="2072">This time they were waiting.</sentence><sentence id="2073">You want to see the president?</sentence><sentence id="2074">Sure.</sentence><sentence id="2075">I walked in and he was -- you know, it was the days of having no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">settee</span> and he was sitting on the armrest with his feet up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">settee</span> and said, sit down.</sentence><sentence id="2076">I was sitting 12 foot away</sentence><sentence id="2078">Interview with Peter Masters *" August 7, 1998</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2079">on the long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">settee</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2080">And he said, can we help you to relocate?</sentence><sentence id="2081">And I said, I -- I think I'll manage.</sentence><sentence id="2082">And in the meantime they offered my assistant, who was Afro- American, my job at half the salary.</sentence><sentence id="2083">And he quit and we formed a partnership, and we freelanced for -- after 10 years, for channel nine, really doing, if I say so myself, an excellent bloody job.</sentence><sentence id="2084">We were way ahead of people, right to the right and left.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2085">Some of them even called us and said, you are giving us a hard time, you are doing such fascinating things that our management is constantly on us.</sentence><sentence id="2086">We freelanced for another five years, as you know, a design partnership.</sentence><sentence id="2087">Now, we did work for the other <span class="BUILDING">networks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2088">We did the [indecipherable] orbital launch for ABC, we did the inaugural coverage for ABC.</sentence><sentence id="2089">We are -- we had been CBS.</sentence><sentence id="2090">They had -- they deliberately prevented us from doing freelance for a few years, out of sheer malice.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2091">Ultimately we got into a difficult situation because my partner -- we were doing a -- a fashion show at the Mayflower with Lyndon Johnson's daughters.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And we were building a -- a--a <span class="DLF">walkway</span> and sets and this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Herndon</span>, <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> and I'd worked there all day and I was getting very tired, and I said, can you come out and finish up, and he said sure.</sentence><sentence id="2093">And as he walked into the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> where we were building things, a guy hit a knot on a four by four [indecipherable] his lathe, and a piece flew off like a shell and hit him -- hit my partner over the head and he had a fractured skull.</sentence><sentence id="2094">And he didn't want to be hospitalized in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> in those days.</sentence><sentence

sometimes take me aside and say, we respect what a courageous thing you are doing.</sentence><sentence id="2104">And I said, what am I doing?</sentence><sentence id="2105">And they said, you have a

id="2226">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 designed the image of the whole thing, the -- the -- the logos, the emblems, the visual impact which was necessary because we had to do everything we could to muster the enthusiasm of a -- a --a nation that was not always enthusiastic about the specific things we were trying to do.</sentence><sentence id="2227">If you tried to open a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">job corps camp</span> somewhere where you were training underprivileged youngsters, these were teenagers and -- and people were afraid of them.</sentence><sentence

to try and overcome.</sentence><sentence id="2229">I remember incidents where in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">job corps camp</span> young men stole a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and drove it into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">station wagon</span> with a family and several members of that family were killed.</sentence><sentence id="2230">And the next day there was an outcry and the

stolen the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> if he had not been in the job corps presumably, and no reason to assume otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="2232">Bu -- and to -- to -- to then crucify the program because s- somebody had deviated what was the kind of thing that we were at times up against.</sentence><sentence id="2233">There were a--a story possibly apic -- apocryphal that went around, that the mayor of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who didn't want to have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">job corps camp</span> next to him said, these are going to be the -- the -- the -- I --I have se -- now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had already opened and he was trying to get it closed down.</sentence><sentence id="2234">And the mayor said, th-the -- it -- it's predominantly blacks in this program, and the official from the war on poverty</sentence><sentence id="2236">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 office of economic opportunity said, as a matter of fact, it's 50 percent white.</sentence><sentence id="2237">It -- it's no -- as a matter of fact, it's only 50 percent black.</sentence><sentence id="2238">And the mayor responded, well, you see, if it were 50 percent white, that would make it all right.</sentence><sentence id="2239">Which, as I say, possibly apocryphally illustrates y -- the absurdity of the prejudice.</sentence><sentence id="2240">The -- then there was this -- a s -- a sudden solution for some of our problems because some brilliant mind, probably Sargent Shriver invented Head Start.</sentence><sentence id="2241">Head Start being a preschool program when children are perceived to be cute and -- and little, and not a threat.</sentence><sentence id="2242">And yet, in and of itself a most useful thing because the learning process should start <span class="BUILDING">pre school</span>, as I think we have all come to realize.</sentence><sentence id="2243">And that was started with a tea at the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2244">It was inaugurated and announced, and --and I designed its -- its -- its logo and so on of a couple of building blocks, symbolically.</sentence><sentence id="2245">Lady Bird Johnson officiated at this opening, of which I had like two days notice, and it's still in existence now.</sentence><sentence id="2246">And I just had a letter from Sarge Shriver about it, because I wrote a short article about how we -- we -- the obstacle course of getting that logo in to the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> tea in -- with -- with no advance notice.</sentence><sentence id="2247">And it was not without problems, because one of the things the legislation had said was, the maximum feasible participation of the poor.</sentence><sentence id="2248">And it was not easy to get -- to recruit poor people who understood the state of the art methodology of dealing with pre-school children, because many of them had themselves been treated very casually, or neglected in their own preschool period or -- and later.</sentence><sentence id="2251">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 And to then put them into a responsible <span class="NPIP">positions</span> to do it in such a way as not to damage the preschool children was -- was not -- well, it was quite a problem.</sentence><sentence id="2252">Still, much good was done over a difficult course.</sentence><sentence id="2253">I worked for them for -- for 10 years.</sentence><sentence id="2254">It started in a real f-- peculiar way.</sentence><sentence id="2255">I mean, they had asked me to -- to help, and I came as a volunteer, and then they wanted more help, and more help.</sentence><sentence id="2256">And I said, listen, you guys, I can't spend all my time here, I have to make a living.</sentence><sentence id="2257">And they said, do you want to do it as an outside person, or as a staff person?</sentence><sentence id="2258">Well, having had the experience with <span class="BUILDING">USA television</span>, where as an outside person I found it terribly hard, I said staff.</sentence><sentence id="2259">And they said, well, what would it take to hire you?</sentence><sentence id="2260">And I s-- mind you, I had really believed when I was first asked to do pro bono contributions that a-all the people working for this program were volunteers and it turned out that all of them were staff and I was a volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="2261">So I became a staff person.</sentence><sentence id="2262">And I remember in the beginning of my being a staff person, which meant somebody gave me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and a telephone, you know, and everything else was improvisation in the beginning, there was a writer who shared my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, as did indeed, five writers.</sentence><sentence id="2263">But this particular one told me of his hardship that he was doing this as volunteer work and he hoped to get a job eventually, and that his children were hungry and neighbors were looking after them and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And I said, you have to -- you know, they are all so busy with what they are doing, they are not thinking of you and me.</sentence><sentence id="2265">And I had to go and say, look, fish or cut bait.</sentence><sentence id="2268">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 Either you -- or I can't come as much as you want me to come and work.</sentence><sentence id="2269">And then they gave me a job.</sentence><sentence id="2270">And he said, darn it, I'm gonna do it.</sentence><sentence id="2271">And he walked down to personnel and never came back.</sentence><sentence id="2272">He had told them to hire him more or not and they said not.</sentence><sentence id="2273">So e-e -- these were rough days.</sentence><sentence id="2274">I mean, you never knew what was going to -- what was going to happen next.</sentence><sentence id="2275">And -- and we moved from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> into improvised <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2276">And at the -- at the times Shriver had two jobs, Peace Corps and poverty program and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2277">But we did an enormous amount of good, I am quite convinced that some of the -- the enthusiasm that was mustered, of you -- you've never seen <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span> like that where people are really -- I mean, they would work into the night and through the night for nothing, to get things out, get things done.</sentence><sentence id="2278">It was a marvelous experience.</sentence><sentence id="2279">Of course, there came the time 10 years later when the administration changed and the new one decided that there was no more poverty in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, along with many other myth, you know, I mean the -- the perception that poverty is priv -- predominantly Afro- American is quite false.</sentence><sentence id="2280">It is by no means that.</sentence><sentence id="2281">It is, percentage-wise there are poor -- poor whites in -- in-- in <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span> and -- and not only in <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2282">Because of the migration to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> to find jobs for the -- from -- from the rural communities, and then the disillusionment when there aren't enough jobs, and living in <span

there was no going back, that you could not -- that no future administration would be foolish enough to go back to where, you know, it would continue to move forward.</sentence><sentence id="2492">That's not true.</sentence><sentence id="2493">They are not only going back at -- to the -- to the -- to square one, they go to 50 years before square one, and there's some common syndromes that I came to observe.</sentence><sentence id="2494">For instance, a person fro -- appointed politically, either party, doesn't make any difference, to some <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and heads maybe a department, maybe a division.</sentence><sentence id="2495">Even smaller sub-units.</sentence><sentence id="2496">You get the impression that the first thing they want to do is to write

particular department, division, whatever, regardless that it's part of a bigger thing, the government, or if you want to go one step down, of -- of -- of one of the agencies of the government, it doesn't matter, they want their own identity.</sentence><sentence id="2498">So they -- for -- I'm -- I'm speaking as a visual person.</sentence><sentence id="2499">So all of a sudden you have all these things spring up, and their taste generally runs to the 19" century, and not the 20" because they haven't heard of what things look like in the 20" century.</sentence><sentence id="2500">But I'm -- when I'm speaking visually, believe me that's symbolic of everything else, they -- they tend to hark back to something they ha -- heard of how things are, where, and they want to imitate, and since

forward.</sentence><sentence id="2505">And people get really doing that at times.</sentence><sentence id="2506">So -- and I'm not even mentioning politics, I'm mentioning simply the bureaucratic process, which is unavoidable to -- s-so it would seem, because innovators who are capable of not that common a specimen.</sentence><sentence id="2507">Well, after many a fight, some of which I've won, I di-- for instance, I designed the building signs in the federal triangle that you still see where the newscasters stand in front of the thing that says Department of Justice, or U.S. Department of Agriculture, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2508">They are these vertical standing brownish colored things with very clear lettering, with a little bulge forward so you can read the title.</sentence><sentence id="2509">And they are made of reinforced fiberglass.</sentence><sentence id="2510">And I had to get those accepted by the fine arts commission.</sentence><sentence

for?</sentence><sentence id="2514">And I said -- I was about to say, oh, state of the art, they last long time, when Carter Brown, who was the chairman of the fine arts commission anticipated that and said, what we are afraid of is that they will last too long, because after 10 years our tastes will have changed and we'll get tired of looking at them, and they won't give us any money to do new ones if they're still good.</sentence><sentence id="2515">So I said, they will last exactly 10 years.</sentence><sentence id="2516">And two things</sentence><sentence id="2518">Interview with Peter Masters

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2571">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2572">The -- when -- "74 -- I'd gone slightly beyond that -- was when the Office of Economic Opportunity ceased to exist and I was transferred to the General Service Administration and I had said that I had, by now, become a fighter for making the government look better to the s -- to the citizen.</sentence><sentence id="2573">And to try and introduce some, at least semblance of the 20" century while it lasted, to the general population.</sentence><sentence id="2574">Whereas everything tended to be done backwards, visually, I mean, a government department.</sentence><sentence id="2575">When I did the signs in the federal triangle, I had</sentence><sentence id="2577">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 to find a sign that would be compatible with the earlier tendency to make a <span class="BUILDING">government office</span> look like a <span class="BUILDING">Greek temple</span>, because why?</sentence><sentence id="2578">A <span class="BUILDING">Greek temple</span> is -- is old and solid, and the government, like <span class="BUILDING">banks</span>, built like <span class="BUILDING">Greek temples</span>, as we used to do, were deemed to be more solid if they looked like a <span class="BUILDING">Greek temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2579">Well then came the -- the craving for modernity, and we got the kind of new deal architecture of an empty -- beginnings of the influences of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bauhaus</span> in -- in -- in style.</sentence><sentence id="2580">And that in turn led to a degree of Bauhaus fatigue.</sentence><sentence id="2581">That you didn't want plain boxes that were functional.</sentence><sentence id="2582">The idea of -- of the <span class="BUILDING">Bauhaus</span> being that if it's functional and -- and -- and simple, and i-i -- and efficient, it is beautiful, and it does not require decoration.</sentence><sentence id="2583">And I was brought up with that in <span class="BUILDING">art school</span>, that simple, if it's functional, it's beautiful, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2584">Now look what's happened since.</sentence><sentence id="2585">We -- because of the -- what I call the Bauhaus fatigue, we started with arbitrary and often ugly decora -- over decoration.</sentence><sentence id="2586">We had put flying buttresses onto <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> as a sort of harking back to when we were building thi -- <span class="BUILDING">Greek temples</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2587">And in post-modern you see arbitrary <span class="DLF">archways</span> that lead nowhere, attached to <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> as -- as decoration.</sentence><sentence id="2588">And -- a-and th-the answer, if any -- no --1--I--I'm not suggesting there is an answer, the answer is that no matter what we have, the only constant thing is -- is change.</sentence><sentence id="2589">We are going to go to something else, because you want something else, and it doesn't mean that it is necessarily better than its predecessor.</sentence><sentence id="2590">That would be nice, and -- but again, like I was saying about -- a-</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2593">80 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 about progress in government, I -- you mustn't accept the notion that because the ultimate has been achieved, that it will therefore stay in -- in -- even in its -- in its degree of quality.</sentence><sentence id="2594">This is true in the arts.</sentence><sentence id="2595">It-- one could make one heck of an argument of saying that beyond Beethoven, you know, maybe we should have stopped there.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Well, that's not fair, because look at some of the great things that have come to us since then.</sentence><sentence id="2597">Whether they are better than the classic, the role models, is -- is arguable.</sentence><sentence id="2598">Another thing is that -- that today's art modern is tomorrow's classic.</sentence><sentence id="2599">We had been talking before about the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and some of us were shocked when they came on the scene.</sentence><sentence id="2600">And some of us now look upon these manifestations as classical, compared to hard rock, compared to where we are now.</sentence><sentence id="2601">We are nostalgic for the Beatles and for Elvis Presley.</sentence><sentence id="2602">You see?</sentence><sentence id="2603">And it's amazing how you can apply this formula to all kinds of completely different things, as I have just done, and I can go beyond that, it is in -- in the ci -- Civil Rights Movement, which I embraced with great enthusiasm, having just been through six years of war to f-- to fight against racism.</sentence><sentence id="2604">And I would have arguments with people on all <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2605">I'd have arguments with some of my Afro- American friends who would say ha -- I had an Afro-American partner with whom I had va -- hardly any arguments, we were on the same wavelengths.</sentence><sentence id="2606">But with some of them who said that the persecution of Afro-Americans was as bad as the Holocaust, and I would say th ho -- ho -- hold it, hold it right there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2609">Interview with Peter Masters * September 25, 1998 [indecipherable] I will agree with one thing, that if -- if you are running away from a lynch mob, it probably doesn't make any difference whether you're running from the Holocaust or from the lynch mob.</sentence><sentence id="2610">But, apart from that, the notion that there is a federal program for your extermination and murder is different than even the collusion and permissiveness of a government that allows lynch mobs.</sentence><sentence id="2611">That -- this is not an advocacy of lynch mobs, obviously, but -- but the point is, the idea that it was legislated to murder everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2612">Men, women, children, old people, whatever, is unique.</sentence><sentence id="2613">And therefore, the comparison does not hold, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2614">I remember that when I was in t -- in television, and my Afro- American assistant, who later became my partner when we both quit, wa -- there was one sort of <span class="BUILDING">greasy spoon restaurant</span> owned by a Greek man on the corner.</sentence><sentence id="2615">The only <span class="NPIP">place</span> you could eat <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, before we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2616">Well, sometimes somebody would say, let's talk about next week's show over lunch at <span class="BUILDING">Frank's</span>, that <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2617">And that meant that I would have to go, and my assistant could not go because of being Afro-American, they didn't serve black people in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2618">Which was embarrassing for me.</sentence><sentence id="2619">I could either say let's not eat, which I wasn't always e-empowered to say, depending on who wanted to eat where and when.</sentence><sentence id="2620">Mind you, they would sell my partner Joe sandwiches to take out.</sentence><sentence id="2621">There was as -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back counter</span>, and he would sometimes have to do that, because he -- he -- he -- well, I don't know, he didn't have time to have a sandwich prepared at <span class="BUILDING">home</span></sentence><sentence id="2623">Interview with Peter Masters * September 25, 1998 -- have to eat.</sentence><sentence id="2624">And we worked around the clock often, you know, so I mean -- came the Civil Rights Act in the 60s and I said, Joe, are you gonna eat at <span class="BUILDING">Frank's</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2625">And he said, I been thinking about that.</sentence><sentence id="2626">And I said, well, I can see both sides of the argument.</sentence><sentence id="2627">Why should you take your custom to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that wouldn't serve you?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2628">In fact, the waitress, when the Civil Rights Act was passed, told me at the meeting that they -- I think I'm going to quit because we are going to have to serve niggers.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2629">And I made some remark saying, well I think it's time that that act was passed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2630">Well, Joe said, on the other hand, if I don't go in to eat at <span class="BUILDING">Joe's</span>, what was the point of getting the Civil Rights Act?</sentence><sentence id="2631">So he said, I think I will.</sentence><sentence id="2632">On the other hand, he said, I will fully understand if some of my race do not go in to eat in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> that were segregated until yesterday, because -- and here comes the important sentence -- not everybody can be a pioneer.</sentence><sentence id="2633">And I think that's true.</sentence><sentence id="2634">I think that there are people who are willing to fight and to be confrontational, and tell people, who say I--1---TI don't think I'm up to that.</sentence><sentence id="2635">And you can try and -- and -- and -- and influence people, but basically it is also true that some people are pioneers and some people are not.</sentence><sentence id="2636">You need the pioneers and you must accept that there are some people who are not.</sentence><sentence id="2637">So, when we got into subsequent discussions, I remember some people I considered racist in the poverty program, saying, you know, we'd come out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> from work and there would be some news headlines out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and they would say that Stokey Carmichael, or Rap</sentence><sentence id="2639">Interview with Peter Masters a September 25, 1998 Brown, aren't they awful troublemakers, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="2640">Now, Martin Luther King, that's a different proposition.</sentence><sentence id="2641">And I said, aren't you forgetting that that's how you looked at Martin, until the more extreme Stokey Carmichaels and Rap Brown came on the scene, by which the -- yesterdays revolutionary becomes the classicist, just like we were saying in the arts, or in other things, you see?</sentence><sentence id="2642">They -- the extreme of today makes the extreme of yesterday the conservative.</sentence><sentence id="2643">In fact, sometimes pathetically so.</sentence><sentence id="2644">And -- and that's -- that's how -- ho-how that played, and it was an ongoing -- an ongoing discussion, and I feel that it has progressed.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2645">But one thing we learned in the poverty program is that we were trying to redress past wrongs.</sentence><sentence id="2646">If you ask the redressee, have we redressed wrongs enough, the answer is inevitably that we have barely scratched the surface.</sentence><sentence id="2647">That leads to someone wanting to put on the brakes, if only for political reasons, because if you are doing something that is unpopular with the general public because they say you are redressing too much, and unpopular with the redressees, because they say you are not redressing enough, you are losing on both <span class="NPIP">sides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2648">You are losing politically and you are losing the things you are setting out to do.</sentence><sentence id="2649">So, you have a very, very, very serious problem, and you inevitably begin to repress a bit together with redressing.</sentence><sentence id="2650">In other words, when you put the brakes on redressing wrongs, you are repressing th-the people.</sentence><sentence id="2651">By that I mean you are denying them some of the redressing they would like to have, because they -- you -- you can't do as much as</sentence><sentence id="2653">Interview with Peter Masters * September 25, 1998 they want you to do.</sentence><sentence id="2654">So, this -- the rather delicate balance between redressing and repressing -- and by repressing I don't mean any -- any acts of -- of -- of -- of keeping somebody down, I'm merely calling it the insufficient redressing which is perceived as repression, all right?</sentence><sentence id="2655">So when you do this -- this -- this delicate balance.</sentence><sentence id="2656">You come to the point where it's almost impossible to walk the tightrope and your political opponents will scream bloody murder that you are redressing too much.</sentence><sentence id="2657">And then you have protesters <span class="NPIP">outside</span> your <span class="BUILDING">building</span> saying you are not redressing enough.</sentence><sentence id="2658">Now, Shriver had a great talent for this, he would go down on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> to the protesters, invite them to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and sit down with them and reason with them.</sentence><sentence id="2659">His successors barricaded themselves in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, stopped the elevator service, which again illustrates the misconception that things that move forward continue to move forward, they don't.</sentence><sentence id="2660">Well, I found that i-in -- in some ways progression continues to progress, perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="2661">An example that comes to mind is anti-Semitism which probably belongs here.</sentence><sentence id="2662">When I first came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and -- in -- in -- in the -- the end of the 40s, the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> had signs saying Gentiles only.</sentence><sentence id="2663">Not whites only, Gentiles only.</sentence><sentence id="2664">And it was in -- understood without saying that that meant white Gentiles, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2665">And there was Father Coughlin and there was Bilbo up on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> spouting anti- Semitism and the likes of which we have mercifully forgotten, how blatant and -- and -- and crude that anti-sin --- Semitism wa -- seemed acceptable on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of</sentence><sentence id="2667">Interview with Peter Masters degdeg September 25, 1998 the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2668">Now, shall we say that has become unfashionable, or deemed primitive, whatever, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2669">And I find it difficult to picture that it would return in totality.</sentence><sentence id="2670">Perhaps there's some elements of the extreme so-called religious right that would like to revive those days.</sentence><sentence id="2671">I'm sure they wouldn't admit it at this point, because as I say, it's unfashionable, and recognized to be primitive, which I think is a good thing.</sentence><sentence id="2672">But we shouldn't delude ourselves that there aren't <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the attitude exists.</sentence><sentence id="2673">I find it exists in-- in Europe to a -- to a considerable extent, more overtly than in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="2674">I was told yesterday by a man who told me that his father was a Nazi, that there is m -- that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, even though there is this movement of -- of -- of the young who -- who -- who abhor their Nazi past, or the Nazi past of their parents, and this man abhors the Nazi past of his father, but he says his father was unemployed, and he was an engineer and he was repairing radios to make a living of sorts.</sentence><sentence id="2675">And when Hitler came to power he got a job as an engineer.</sentence><sentence id="2676">So he thought that -- he -- he said, what they are doing to the Jews is -- that's bad, bad.</sentence><sentence id="2677">But look what it has done for me.</sentence><sentence id="2678">And von Stauffenberg, who tried to assassinate Hitler is considered a traitor by one and all, by the vast majority of people.</sentence><sentence id="2679">I found that shocking, I didn't know that, I thought -- and I still believe there are segments of the people who consider him a resistance person.</sentence><sentence id="2680">This -- this man told me that there isn't a single <span class="DLF">memorial</span> or monument to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stauffenberg</span>, because vast majority of people consider him a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2683">86 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 traitor.</sentence><sentence id="2684">Now, I -- I've -- I--I find that -- I mean, that came as a shock.</sentence><sentence id="2685">I did not know that.</sentence><sentence id="2686">I thought that the disillusionment with Hitler and -- and by saying disillusionment I'm implying that there was an illusionment before, and -- and there certainly was.</sentence><sentence id="2687">And some of it, if you will understand the burden, like the man who didn't have a job that got a job, like the peculiar historic situation where you have a German Reich that was 90 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2688">Before that there were duchies and principalities of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, <span class="REGION">Saxony</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2689"><span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2690">And that after losing World War I, there was -- first of all, it was kept intact, as opposed to the Austro-Hungarian empire, which was 2,000 years old and was completely chopped up because of the ethnic elements, all of whom had been caught in this thing we just mentioned about th-th-the tightrope between repression and redressing, because if an Austrian emperor or Austrian government tried to redress the demands of the Hungarians, or the Serbs, or the Czechs, it was politically unpopular at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and deemed insufficient by the recipients of the programs, who wanted out, never mind how and just sooner better than later.</sentence><sentence id="2691">As indeed we are now Seeing in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and in all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> where small minorities, whether they are viable or not, completely not caring about whether they can form a viable entity, want to be nationalistically independent.</sentence><sentence id="2692">Even the most reasonable among them, and I have talked to some of the most reasonable, will say that first we must have our independence and then we can attempt to confederate.</sentence><sentence id="2693">In the meantime,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2696">Interview with Peter Masters a September 25, 1998 the process of getting that independence is bloody and -- and destructive.</sentence><sentence id="2697">And unreasonable.</sentence><sentence id="2698">And -- and there's nothing we seem to be able to do about it because we don't necessarily progress.</sentence><sentence id="2699">Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, this -- this relatively recent empire of -- of -- of 90 year old confederation, they yearned to be powerful again.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2700">Understandably, the Austro-Hungarians never had any dream of becoming a powerful <span class="COUNTRY">empire</span> again, because that would mean gluing together the thing where the glue hadn't held, o-of -- of -- of ethnic minorities, you see?</sentence><sentence id="2701">So they never had that ambition, except perhaps in the case of some Austrians who were pan -- pan- German thinkers, and thought as part of the German empire, they could see some greatness again.</sentence><sentence id="2702">But I wouldn't say there were many until Hitler demonstrated that that dream of be -- of -- of -- of regaining power for this German entity could be realized, in that he was immensely successful politically and -- and -- and -- and militarily.</sentence><sentence id="2703">And took over one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> after the other, right?</sentence><sentence id="2704">And if your victorious armies are marching into <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> after <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with a minimum of casualties, and asserting themselves as -- as the masters of the world, it's probably hard for the average citizen not to stand and cheer at -- at the sidelines, when all that technological hardware is rolling past

right, you can't undertake things that are -- that you're going to lose.</sentence><sentence id="2719">It's impractical.</sentence><sentence id="2720">So for pragmatic reasons if nothing else, the idea of subduing communism in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span>, which turned out to be a popular nationalistic movement, if you are going to -- to fight a losing war, the answer obviously is don't

justifiably afraid of that now, is really, A, it -- it-- it doesn't apply in the same sense as it applied at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2736">And there were probably a couple of other factors in there.</sentence><sentence id="2737">I think that we are still in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> resentful of the former colonial powers, because after all, we were under British rule, and so, if the British were pushed out of the <span class="REGION">Persian gulf</span>, that didn't really hurt us.</sentence><sentence id="2738">I-If the French were pushed out of <span

id="2809"><span class="DLF">Holland tunnel</span> or whatever, and in those days, if you got a ride straight through it took seven and a half hours, and you never got a ride straight through, so it took</sentence><sentence id="2811">Interview with Peter Masters "4 September 25, 1998 10 - 11 - 12 hours.</sentence><sentence id="2812">And I would start at -- after <span

you.</sentence><sentence id="2817">I usually hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> in the early hours of the morning, like two o'clock a-and -- and usually on a <span

followed me and in fact I-- I had a suitcase and a portfolio to carry, so they could walk faster than I could, and they -- I -- I decided I w -- I would -- I would walk in the middle of the <span

incident and looked very threatening.</sentence><sentence id="2824">And a -- another story that comes to mind is it -- one time it poured, and it was just before Alice's birthday and I was -- I had bought her ano -- a new umbrella, and it was gift wrapped.</sentence><sentence id="2825">And I carried that umbrella gift wrapped and wouldn't open it because I didn't want to spoil the thing, I carried it under my jacket so it wouldn't get wet.</sentence><sentence id="2826">Anyway, after hitchhiking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> a few times, w-we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2827">And in the following spring,</sentence><sentence id="2829">Interview with Peter Masters deg8 September 25, 1998 1950, we were married.</sentence><sentence id="2830">And Alice had arranged some interviews for me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to find a job, and the person who was going to help me find the job ran a small public relations agency, and he desired -- he si -- he decided that he would hire me himself and call it public relations and advertising and I was the art director of this small outfit, and it was not an altogether positive experience.</sentence><sentence id="2831">I think I earned 30 dollars a week and that was low even by the standards of that time.</sentence><sentence id="2832">But I had quite some exposure.</sentence><sentence id="2833">I did three full color ads for "Esquire" magazine and I found that I had to solicit some of the jobs because nobody else seemed to be doing it and after awhile everybody quit and I was the only employee.</sentence><sentence id="2834">But one of them had preceded me into television and he offered me a -- a job in television.</sentence><sentence id="2835">We've -- may have covered that before.</sentence><sentence id="2836">Anyway, in the meantime, A-Alice and I had moved into a <span class="INT_SPACE">one room apartment</span> on -- on <span class="DLF">Belmont Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, which was rather -- rather primitive, but not -- not at all bad, and after a period we moved downtown into an air conditioned <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2837">That was the height of luxury.</sentence><sentence id="2838">Small one, also.</sentence><sentence id="2839">And we had our first child, a daughter, Anne, who from a very early age wanted to do professionally exactly what I was doing and -- and helped me, even as a child.</sentence><sentence id="2840">And got very proficient and became a good graphic designer and is one to this day.</sentence><sentence id="2841">Then we had a second daughter, Kim, who also -- all of them leaned in directions that I had marginally been involved in.</sentence><sentence id="2842">She started to write poetry, which we have done traditionally in my</sentence><sentence id="2844">Interview with Peter Masters *deg September 25, 1998 family for every birthday.</sentence><sentence id="2845">And of course, she went beyond that and she became a writer and is at this stage a contributing editor to "Wanity Fair" and "Time" magazine, and is writing her second book, called tentatively, "Keys to the Kingdom," meaning Michael Eisner and the Disney operation.</sentence><sentence id="2846">That's big league writing, not the sort of thing that -- that I'm doing.</sentence><sentence id="2847">Well, as -- this morning, as a matter of fact, in looking for a certain book, I came across the album of -- of birthday cards over the years, and it's quite a collection because they are both graphics and -- and -- and at least doggerel verse, and it's a heartwarming memento that I -- I --I think i-I -- astonished me because I had forgotten some of them, they've been so long ago.</sentence><sentence id="2848">But the tradition goes on.</sentence><sentence id="2849">The tradition also goes on to my third child which -- Tim, a -- a--a son who works for the Discovery Channel as senior manager of special events, and lives only five minutes from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2850">And he writes absolutely beautiful birthday poets -- poems.</sentence><sentence id="2851">Everybody knows what birthday poems sound like and I sometimes wince at the bad meter and -- and the suggested ego trip of all of us who do this.</sentence><sentence id="2852">But my daughter Kim and my son Tim, write absolutely gorgeous ones, far better than anything I've ever done.</sentence><sentence id="2853">And incidentally, my children being named Anne, Kim and Tim, the last one was Kim's idea, together with the support of her older sister.</sentence><sentence id="2854">And we said, if we call him Tim and we calling you -- him -- or we call you, you will never know which one we are calling because it sounds alike.</sentence><sentence id="2855">And she said, that's the idea.</sentence><sentence id="2856">A-As you</sentence><sentence id="2858">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 can see where she comes from.</sentence><sentence id="2859">Well, they're all married.</sentence><sentence id="2860">Anne is married to an architect and lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and has three children; David, who is now 11, Sam, who is nine and Hannah who is almost six.</sentence><sentence id="2861">And Kim had great trouble -- she is married to Gary Simpson, who is in television, movies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2862">She -- Kim moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> because she covers <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2863">She used to work for the "Washington Post" for many years for style, but now she doesn't work for a papers, she writes the book and contributes articles to those two publications.</sentence><sentence id="2864">She had great difficulty having a baby.</sentence><sentence id="2865">She had 10 in-vitros attempting to have a baby, all failed.</sentence><sentence id="2866">And ultimately succeeded by having a -- a surrogate carry her child.</sentence><sentence id="2867">The baby is hers and her husband's, implanted into a surrogate, who carried it and it's now a few months old, a little girl.</sentence><sentence id="2868">And the -- one thing that comes to mind is when she and the surrogate were together in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the birth of the baby, the baby cried during the night, and Kim said, the baby is crying.</sentence><sentence id="2869">And the surrogate mother said, it's not my baby, you go and take care of it.</sentence><sentence id="2870">And she has been doing that happily ever since.</sentence><sentence id="2871">Took some adjustment, because when you don't carry the baby, the impact on your life, whe -- which suddenly changes without the relief of not carrying it any more is -- is quite an experience, that I hadn't really anticipated.</sentence><sentence id="2872">But she adjusted to it very well, and now all is going very well.</sentence><sentence id="2873">And as we sit here and speak, Tim and his wife Laurie, who also works for Discovery cable television, she is vice-president in charge of marketing, expect their first baby.</sentence><sentence id="2874">The</sentence><sentence id="2876">Interview with Peter Masters 8 September 25, 1998 phone could ring now.</sentence><sentence id="2877">I know we've turned them off, but even so, and she might be having that baby.</sentence><sentence id="2878">We don't know whether it's a boy or a girl, any -- any day now.</sentence><sentence id="2879">The -- all three children, by the way, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in -- in this <span class="REGION">area</span>, in the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span>, and all three of them didn't like <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, and wanted to get out as soon as possible.</sentence><sentence id="2880">So, it was possible in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> to take, I don't know, English four and I forget what else, math, over the summer and graduate early.</sentence><sentence id="2881">All three of them did that.</sentence><sentence id="2882">You didn't have to be brilliant to graduate early, just had to take a couple of summer courses.</sentence><sentence id="2883">And they wanted to avoid the graduation ceremony, none of them wanted to go through it, peculiarly perhaps, and all of them wanted out.</sentence><sentence id="2884">And all of them -- each one of them did something different with the year they gained by graduating a year early.</sentence><sentence id="2885">Anne worked for a <span class="BUILDING">design studio</span> before she went to <span class="BUILDING">art school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2886">She had helped me all along.</sentence><sentence id="2887">And after a period of good experience, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pratt</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and was in many ways ahead, because she had the practical experience.</sentence><sentence id="2888">And this was in a period when practicality was not big in the <span class="BUILDING">art schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2889">You know, they would say, design a logo for -- design a logo for a -- an -- and use -- draw it on a brick.</sentence><sentence id="2890">If that sounds absurd, that was -- I'm -- I'm doing this on purpose, or a cinder block, because that was characteristic of the time.</sentence><sentence id="2891">Practicality was not the main thing.</sentence><sentence id="2892">You did things that were impractical, but original, okay?</sentence><sentence id="2893">It was the post-modern I talked to you about before.</sentence><sentence id="2894">Well, so that was how she spent her year that she gained.</sentence><sentence id="2895">Kim did</sentence><sentence id="2897">Interview with Peter Masters " September 25, 1998 something entirely different.</sentence><sentence id="2898">She went to visit my wife's sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2899">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> the county council runs all kinds of courses, which are affordable and very, very good.</sentence><sentence id="2900">So she learned -- she took courses in all the things she might want to be interested in later, having no idea where she was going to go.</sentence><sentence id="2901">She took one in psychology, one in ceramics, one in Italian, one in drama, and I forget what else.</sentence><sentence id="2902">And after she was through, she decided none of the above, and she became an English major, and now it became very important at what <span class="BUILDING">school</span> she was to continue.</sentence><sentence id="2903">And one of my colleagues on -- a very senior older person in the poetry program, had been a president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryn Mawr</span>, and she -- and when I talked about the program said, oh Kim absolutely must go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryn Mawr</span> and she took her there.</sentence><sentence id="2904">And there was a sort of a -- it really fitted Kim like -- like a glove.</sentence><sentence id="2905">There is a traditional Poet Laureate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryn Mawr</span> who is anonymous un -- and writes under the name of Applebee, which was the

Kim became Applebee in her junior year, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2909">And the -- the -- I--I even recall the interview because Kim had read more books than anybody I know, and sh -- before

September 25, 1998 your reading list.</sentence><sentence id="2913">And she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cornell</span> and they looked at her reading list, which was a --a foldout, a-a -- it was so long, and said, about what we would expect and that offended Kim deeply because she knew it wasn't true.</sentence><sentence id="2914">It was a putdown, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2915">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryn Mawr</span>, when she showed her reading list, the interviewer put it aside after glancing at it and said yes, but what is your favorite -- who is your favorite author?</sentence><sentence id="2916">And Kim said, without hesitation, Jane Austen.</sentence><sentence id="2917">And the interviewer said, she is mine too, let's talk about Jane Austen.</sentence><sentence id="2918">They talked for three hours about Jane Austen.</sentence><sentence id="2919">So there's no question she was going to go anywhere else.</sentence><sentence id="2920">Tim used his extra year to take an internship in television, because he had been interested in -- in radio and television from being a -- a toddler.</sentence><sentence id="2921">In fact, in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> hangs a picture of him with his first phonograph when he was about four years old, and he is carefully putting down the needle, and subsequently worked as a disc jockey for the university of dis -- dis -- District of Columbia station.</sentence><sentence id="2922">He had a program called Jazzmasters with Tim Masters.</sentence><sentence id="2923">And when C- Span bought the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and there was no more jazz, the hearts of all the listeners bled, because they were so attached to that classical jazz program.</sentence><sentence id="2924">And he misses it.</sentence><sentence id="2925">He did it for, I think 12 years, as a <span class="DLF">sideline</span>, unpaid.</sentence><sentence id="2926">But he has been in -- in some form of -- of broadcasting all -- all his life.</sentence><sentence id="2927">Well, where were we?</sentence><sentence id="2928">Yes, my wife Alice, who came for a year, stayed for 36 years.</sentence><sentence id="2929">She became an administrative officer, and her -- by now there are few people left who remember</sentence><sentence id="2931">101 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 her, but there are some, and when we go there for some function, or if we meet somebody by chance, she would -- was literally a legend in that organization, because having been a--a-- from a children's transport, you know, and having been self reliant from an early teenage age, she was so protective of the people working on the staff, that she would tell newly arrivals that the first thing they'd have to do is to start thinking of their careers in terms of security and retirement and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2932">And very few people -- very few young people think about that at all.</sentence><sentence id="2933">And now there are many -- there are many out there who are thanking her for her being so solicitous.</sentence><sentence id="2934">And she is a most remarkable person.</sentence><sentence id="2935">She is a -- a -- the -- the fastest at many things that I can -- that I've ever seen.</sentence><sentence id="2936">I mean, if |-- if we go shopping and I get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I can't see where she is, it is because she is already in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, having carried 50 percent of the bags and dinner is almost ready.</sentence><sentence id="2937">You know, that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="2938">And she never hesitated to have a social life, to -- to invite people, while she was working.</sentence><sentence id="2939">And how -- how is -- is -- by today's standards, unimaginable.</sentence><sentence id="2940">And -- and I -- I don't think -- I mean, some of my children have to have -- have dinner party, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="2941">But to think of the kind of dinner party she would have fo-for friends after she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work, and it was ready and delicious at the time when you didn't think she had hung up her coat yet.</sentence><sentence id="2942">It's just a very special talent.</sentence><sentence id="2943">When we were recently visiting friends on <span class="REGION">Cape Cod</span>, we had an engagement to which we had to go, I'll come back to that</sentence><sentence id="2945">102 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 later, and we were going to have dinner afterwards, at our guests".</sentence><sentence id="2946">And we had been talking about a continent-ental dessert that is -- is a big favorite in central and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2947">And in central and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> it's a dessert -- it's a dumpling, either with plums or apricots.</sentence><sentence id="2948">But she has figured out that it's better with peaches, because there's more fruit and the peaches are so good in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and in -- particularly this year, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="2949">So, she said, I'm going to make that for dessert.</sentence><sentence id="2950">And they said, well do it afterwards, because we really have to go.</sentence><sentence id="2951">And she said, it won't take a minute.</sentence><sentence id="2952">She had du-dumplings for five people ready while the others were putting on their jackets to go to the function.</sentence><sentence id="2953">And so when we came back, all she had to do is put them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, and they were done, you know, I mean none --none of them could believe that she had actually accomplished that in this extremely narrow time span.</sentence><sentence id="2954">Doesn't bother her [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="2955">And she has become a most valued counselor for my activities, which of course means particularly the book I have written.</sentence><sentence id="2956">And the reason I wrote that book is because I felt that as the interest in the Holocaust and in World War II revived, people were writing books and telling stories that were horrible, and in recounting their -- their stories, and I felt that someone ought to stress the fact that not everybody went like sheep to the slaughter, but some of us had the fortunate opportunity to be able to fight back.</sentence><sentence id="2957">So I -- and in addition, I wanted to commemorate all those who were less lucky that I was, because a lot of my refugee friends who succeeded in ha -- in</sentence><sentence id="2959">103 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 -- in doing special and hazardous duty, were killed or maimed or at least wounded.</sentence><sentence id="2960">I was one of the lucky ones that came through without a scratch except a tiny grenade splinter in my rear end that I threw myself in house clearing, by being a little cowboy-like -- cavalier about how I tossed the grenade.</sentence><sentence id="2961">Which was partly encouraged by the management to be a little macho.</sentence><sentence id="2962">Came with the job.</sentence><sentence id="2963">So, I wrote my first book as a septuagenarian.</sentence><sentence id="2964">It took me years and years to do it, because I had no idea how one writes a book.</sentence><sentence id="2965">But I'd always had the inclination to tell stories, as you can tell from this interview.</sentence><sentence id="2966">So I --I first wrote -- I tried to do it by tape recording while walking the dog when I'd had a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="2967">And I-- my children ga-gave -- borrowed somebody's dog or something, a very ugly Dalmatian.</sentence><sentence id="2968">And I had to walk this dog twice a day, and they gave me a tape recorder and they said, that way you can get your -- the book you always talk about, written.</sentence><sentence id="2969">And I recorded while walking the dog.</sentence><sentence id="2970">You can hear <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> going by and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2971">And then I tried to get it transcribed, because I can't type.</sentence><sentence id="2972">And I found several people who said they would do it, and they had two common denominators.</sentence><sentence id="2973">One, they were very expensive, and two, they were absolutely incompetent at understanding what I was saying, perhaps because of my accent, perhaps because there are many proper nouns in there that they were unfamil -- that were unfamiliar to them.</sentence><sentence id="2974">And I struggled.</sentence><sentence id="2975">I tried to transcribe it myself, I found I couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="2976">So some friend said, you got to get yourself a word</sentence><sentence id="2978">104 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 processor and I did.</sentence><sentence id="2979">It's a very primitive <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">word processor</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2980">And I struggled to learn it and found that every now and again it would absolutely balk and not do what I told it to do.</sentence><sentence id="2981">So I needed to call friends to help me to get it going again, to jumpstart it.</sentence><sentence id="2982">And I found that this happened so often, that one friend wouldn't do it, I couldn't bother the same person, so I alternated about three friends and called them with my emergencies, in the middle of the night at times, because I couldn't stop, I had to go on.</sentence><sentence id="2983">And that -- that -- with their patience and my persistence, that seemed to work.</sentence><sentence id="2984">And then I talked to some publishers without submitting it, but I-- I submitted, I think a synopsis to one in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, with whom I met and he said, you know, it doesn't all have to be true.</sentence><sentence id="2985">And that finished it as far as I was concerned, because that was precisely my purpose, that it should all be true.</sentence><sentence id="2986">H-He said, you know, faction is acceptable.</sentence><sentence id="2987">And I--as long as you have a thrill on every page.</sentence><sentence id="2988">I thought there were enough thrills without having to invent them.</sentence><sentence id="2989">So we parted before we even started.</sentence><sentence id="2990">And then I--I went to various people for advice and some of the advice was good and some of it was -- was not.</sentence><sentence id="2991">Some people said, you must have more dialog, some people said you must have less dialog.</sentence><sentence id="2992">Some people said you must be sequential.</sentence><sentence id="2993">And I think that's true.</sentence><sentence id="2994">People want to know how it continues.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3238">Q: Speaking of continuing, I have to pause to change the tape.</sentence><sentence id="3239">Just one moment.</sentence></p></dialogue>

September 25, 1998 volunteer collection interview with Peter Masters.</sentence><sentence id="3247">This is tape four, side B, and you were telling me about your book, and the genesis of your book.</sentence><sentence id="3248">Let me first ask you, can you give me the title of your book?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3249">A: The book is called, "Striking Back."</sentence><sentence id="3250">I -- I literally polled some of my commando friends and other people for a title and they made all kinds of suggestions.</sentence><sentence id="3251">I can't pin down where the title ultimately came from, except perhaps i-in discussion between the publisher and myself, and utilizing, and re -- rattling off all the names that have been suggested.</sentence><sentence id="3252">And the publisher wrote the subtitle modified from something that I suggested, namely, it's called "Striking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis."</sentence><sentence id="3253">I wanted to say Jewish refugee commandos, but they said, the word refugee has a different connotation nowadays and people wouldn't know what it means in this context.</sentence><sentence id="3254">And besides, it's too long.</sentence><sentence id="3255">So there it is, a Jewish refugees war against the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="3256">And a -- well, how did I find a publisher and be -- believe me, people have asked me since, how do you get a book published, like I'm the expert.</sentence><sentence id="3257">And of course I -- first time author, and I -- what do I know?</sentence><sentence id="3258">So, the -- the way -- the way this came about was that the historian Stephen Ambrose, who was the head of the -- president of the <span class="BUILDING">Eisenhower Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span>, and professor at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Louisiana</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span>, and the D<span class="BUILDING">-Day Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span>, called together D-Day veterans from -- mostly from the U.S. forces, but some from --</sentence><sentence id="3260">Interview with Peter Masters a September 25, 1998 from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and one from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3261">And -- people who had experienced D- Day.</sentence><sentence id="3262">And a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, Harry Nomberg(ph) called me, he was a commando friend, he served under the name of Harry Drew, and he said, my wife and I are going, why don't you come with Alice?</sentence><sentence id="3263">And we decided we'd all go.</sentence><sentence id="3264">And we had work sessions and it was absolutely fascinating because you could talk to people who had been involved in some other activity on D-Day that I had seen but never fully understood.</sentence><sentence id="3265">And now you could ask questions, how did you do this?</sentence><sentence id="3266">How did these rocket firing craft work that were on our left, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3267">And we all submitted a tape beforehand and Ambrose told me that he liked mine am -- and considered it to be among his best.</sentence><sentence id="3268">And we -- and then he wrote the book, D-Day, which became a best seller and my story is in there in multiple installments about my D-Day experience.</sentence><sentence id="3269">So I mentioned to him that I we -- was -- I wanted to write a book, for the reasons I've already stated.</sentence><sentence id="3270">And he said, you must absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="3271">And I said, don't I need an agent?</sentence><sentence id="3272">And he said, yes you do, why don't you use mine?</sentence><sentence id="3273">And he recommended me to his agent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and that didn't work out at all, because the man told me on th -- I never met him, but the man told me on the phone that he was suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and it would be quite some time before he got around to reading my book, because he -- he couldn't in his present condition.</sentence><sentence id="3274">That was very discouraging.</sentence><sentence id="3275">Secondly -- I mean, I had notions that I'd get it out for the 50" anniversary of D-Day, and it --I</sentence><sentence id="3277">107 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 was clearly not going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="3278">Then he said, it will require extensive editing, and he recommended an editor to me, who said he charged 250 dollars an hour.</sentence><sentence id="3279">And I said, I can't afford for you to read my book, leave alone to edit it.</sentence><sentence id="3280">And we made a -- an agreement that I would pay him an amount for giving me advice, after reading some of the book.</sentence><sentence id="3281">And he gave me some advice, some of it good, some of it I discarded, which was to be anticipated.</sentence><sentence id="3282">Then a man published a book about my overall unit, that is a-- my -- my commando unit, in which I was fortunate enough to -- to be able to strike back.</sentence><sentence id="3283">It was number three troop, 10 commando.</sentence><sentence id="3284">The 10 commando had two French troops, a Dutch troop, a Norwegian troop, a Polish troop.</sentence><sentence id="3285">I think we've been through that.</sentence><sentence id="3286">And he wrote about all of us, you know, so we were one chapter in that book.</sentence><sentence id="3287">And this man had done considerable research and was familiar with all the dramatis personae.</sentence><sentence id="3288">So I told -- 1-1 --he offered to help me edit, and -- and to advise me.</sentence><sentence id="3289">And in return, he was writing additional books on the SOE, special operations of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> -- of the allied forces, and he needed research done at the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, because it didn't exist in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3290">So I did the research for him for days on end, and found very interesting things that he could use in his book and in return he -- we exchanged tapes and he advised me.</sentence><sentence id="3291">When I told Stephen Ambrose that he and -- that I--I didn't get along with his agent, he said, oh, I haven't used him in years.</sentence><sentence id="3292">But naturally it didn't occur to him to, you know, to -- to call me and say I didn't use -- I don't use that agent any</sentence><sentence id="3294">108 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 more.</sentence><sentence id="3295">And he said, well, there are several options, and one of the ideas that came up was that I should talk to the people at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3296">And I talked to Mr. Aronowitz at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, who had been in publishing in a previous life, and he said, tell you what I'll do.</sentence><sentence id="3297">I-I will print out publishers who I think would be interested in your book.</sentence><sentence id="3298">Now, they won't all be big publishers, some of them specialize in military memoirs and that's probably a prime consideration.</sentence><sentence id="3299">And he printed out the list and the top publisher on the list was Presidio Press in <span class="REGION">California</span>, and I sent them -- a-and Mr. Aronowitz advised me that the way to do it was to telephone and ask for the acquisition editor.</sentence><sentence id="3300">Now, the average first time author doesn't know that, and sends it blind.</sentence><sentence id="3301">Well, I sent it to the acquisition editor and got a letter back saying we are interested in your book.</sentence><sentence id="3302">First publisher I submitted it to.</sentence><sentence id="3303">And they accepted the book, they said they print 20 volumes a year, and they get 1600 submissions.</sentence><sentence id="3304">And before the book was printed, it was ti-- the movie options were bought by <span class="BUILDING">Miramax</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3305">And recently the German translation options were bought by a German publisher, whom I'm trying to contact to offer my services in case they need any help, because I want to make sure that it's done right.</sentence><sentence id="3306">Now, the book has totally changed my life.</sentence><sentence id="3307">As a first time septuagenarian author, I am being asked to speak here, there and everywhere and to give book talks.</sentence><sentence id="3308">The story I told you about the fruit dumplings, the commitment to which we were not to be late was at the <span class="BUILDING">Eldredge Library</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chatham</span> on Cape</sentence><sentence id="3310">109 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 Cod.</sentence><sentence id="3311">And this is a retiree audience, by no means Jewish, and they were a marvelous audience.</sentence><sentence id="3312">And I spoke for about an hour, and then I -- we had a book signing at the <span class="BUILDING">bookstore</span> about three <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away.</sentence><sentence id="3313">And I said, I think I -- I have to finish now, so that we make it in time to the <span class="BUILDING">bookstore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3314">And the people started to yell, don't stop, keep going, we want to hear more.</sentence><sentence id="3315">Which is fascinating, I mean it's -- it's -- they were really interested and into it and asked intelligent questions and I have since discovered that in these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New England towns</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> is really the focal point of the community.</sentence><sentence id="3316">That's where people gather.</sentence><sentence id="3317">I mean, it's a sort of intellectual exercise.</sentence><sentence id="3318">And that's -- that's always a good sign and very gratifying.</sentence><sentence id="3319">But apart from that, and I spoke to an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where there were 450 people and no microphone because I was billed as the -- the Shabbat preacher, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="3320">And so nobody could turn on a microphone and I couldn't hold a piece of paper, because that's working.</sentence><sentence id="3321">I mean, carrying the piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="3322">And so I thought how, as a sergeant major you would have to shout that you could be heard at the other end of the <span class="DLF">parade ground</span> and I thought I sa--I---I did that when I was a sergeant, I'll do it again.</sentence><sentence id="3323">Be -- the rabbi was doing it.</sentence><sentence id="3324">And it worked very well, and I was given all kinds of honors, opening the <span class="DLF">ark</span> and closing the <span class="DLF">ark</span>, I was worried whether it was -- you -- you asked earlier about my religious orientation, which was -- activity, which was somewhat marginal.</sentence><sentence id="3325">I was Bar Mitzvahed, and my grandfather was a very religious man, but he never explained</sentence><sentence id="3327">Interview with Peter Masters m September 25, 1998 a--a---a word about -- not even at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seder</span>, he just rattled off his prayers and -- and was a--not a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="3328">Well, so I was worried whether I was going to do all these things right in the <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span>, I'd never officiated in -- in any <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> leave alone an Orthodox one.</sentence><sentence id="3329">And they said there will be somebody behind you who will tell you to do all the right things, and it turned out it was very, very simple, it worked very well, and I shook hands for umpteen officials in a given order [indecipherable] traditional.</sentence><sentence id="3330">I also spoke at a <span class="BUILDING">Reform synagogue</span> to largely veterans.</sentence><sentence id="3331">And there is an a-americ -- an organization called AJEX, the Association of Jewish ex-Servicemen and Women.</sentence><sentence id="3332">And they organized that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edgware</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3333">And I spoke there, and when I finished -- again, marvelous audience, the -- there wer-were questions and one man stood up in the audience and said, you say your mission is to spread the word that you didn't go like lambs to slaughter, you are accomplishing that, I trust.</sentence><sentence id="3334">But you are accomplishing another mission that you don't even know of.</sentence><sentence id="3335">And he held up a British army pay book, which every soldiers carries.</sentence><sentence id="3336">And he said, this is my uncle's pay book.</sentence><sentence id="3337">Pma member of the Sachs(ph) family of -- of refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3338">And my uncle served under the name of Seymour in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commando troop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3339">And until we read your book just now, the family did not know what happened to him beyond the <span class="BUILDING">war office</span> telegram saying that he was killed in action.</sentence><sentence id="3340">In your book you say that i-in the night assault crossing of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Rhine</span>, you were in a <span class="DLF">amphibious track</span></sentence><sentence id="3342">Interview with Peter Masters m September 25, 1998 cra -- <span

flames, and that nobody got out alive, as far as you know.</sentence><sentence id="3343">And two of the people on it, you say, were Fogel(ph) and Sachs(ph) who served under the name of [indecipherable] and Seymour.</sentence><sentence id="3344">And this is the first time we found out what happened to my uncle.</sentence><sentence id="3345">And that brings closure to our feelings and we thank you for it.</sentence><sentence id="3346">And people in the audience started to cry, and it was very emotional, and I felt that it somehow made it all worthwhile to have done this, and struggled to write the book and to do this.</sentence><sentence id="3347">And that's by no means all.</sentence><sentence id="3348">I had the phone call from a woman who said that her name was Claudine Schindler.</sentence><sentence id="3349">Actually Claudine Arbour Schin-Schindler.</sentence><sentence id="3350">And she had seen the article about me that was caused by my book in the B'nai B'rith international magazine, th-the monthly.</sentence><sentence id="3351">And it said that my name had been Arany, and her name had been Arany, and were we related?</sentence><sentence id="3352">And she started to lay out her family.</sentence><sentence id="3353">And she is the granddaughter of my father's oldest brother, who was a -- quite a character, in fact the name Arany was invented by him.</sentence><sentence id="3354">The family name had been Freed(ph) but on -- being in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> he wanted to have a Hungarian name, and what's more, he was a sort of macho character who in the 20s wore a black leather jacket and rode a red <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Indian motorcycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3355">And my father imitated him in almost everything, his older brother.</sentence><sentence id="3356">They were both jewelers.</sentence><sentence id="3357">Arany in Hungarian means gold, so it was sort of a pun to have that name.</sentence><sentence id="3358">And in addition, it's the name of the national poet</sentence><sentence id="3360">Interview with Peter Masters m September 25, 1998 of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, Arianosh(ph), and aristocratic, he wanted tha -- obviously.</sentence><sentence id="3361">And he -- he was divorced from a very nice woman whom I knew much better than I knew my Uncle Carol(ph), Isa(ph) who ran a -- a pensionne in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that belonged to some very wealthy relatives of hers.</sentence><sentence id="3362">But she was sort of the poor relative.</sentence><sentence id="3363">Lovely woman, who invited us as children a couple of times to this pensionne in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I have very nice memories of that.</sentence><sentence id="3364">We had to be on our best behavior because of all the elegant people there.</sentence><sentence id="3365">And she had two sons, Aussie(ph) and Jurry(ph) Arany, and apparently they got out.</sentence><sentence id="3366">We were not in touch.</sentence><sentence id="3367">And they got out and lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> throughout the war, running from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> in hiding, as people did who survived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3368">And then one of them got -- oh, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they changed the name Arany to Arbor, spelled like the English word arbor, but pronounced arbore(ph).</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="3598">115 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3599">A: The status of the movie may be known to the moviemakers, a-and -- and I -- not even to the publisher, because the publisher handed it to the William Morris Agency, who acts as his agent, and o-other than my having a contract with the publisher for a portion of subsidiary rights, lest anyone thinks that -- well, one of the English papers wrote the last paragraph in a review saying, and Peter Masters sold his book, "Striking Back," to the movies for a million dollars.</sentence><sentence id="3600">Well, don't you believe it.</sentence><sentence id="3601">First of all, there's no million dollars.</sentence><sentence id="3602">Secondly, the <span class="BUILDING">William Morris Agency</span> gets 10 percent off the top.</sentence><sentence id="3603">The publisher gets 50 percent of the remainder.</sentence><sentence id="3604">That's already si-- more than 60 percent if you take then off the top.</sentence><sentence id="3605">Then my -- my daughter Kim who covers <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> told me, you have to have a lawyer when there's a movie contract.</sentence><sentence id="3606">And I said, why, naively.</sentence><sentence id="3607">And she said, try to go it alone and see what happens to you.</sentence><sentence id="3608">So I have a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3609">He gets five percent, okay?</sentence><sentence id="3610">Then they bought the movie option, that doesn't mean they are making the movie just yet, although they assigned a writer and a producer, which is promising.</sentence><sentence id="3611">But I haven't seen a piece of paper, but when I ask I am told it's a done deal.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3612">So a done deal is a favorite expression in the <span class="BUILDING">publishing business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3613">Now, people expect me to tell them how to get books published [indecipherable] and I used to say, look, I'm a novice and I don't know and that didn't seem to make them very happy, they thought I was hedging.</sentence><sentence id="3614">So after awhile I decided I would try and give them more of an answer.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3615">And so I came up with the following formula.</sentence><sentence id="3616">And they send me manuscripts, okay?</sentence><sentence id="3617">So I said, it takes three ingredients.</sentence><sentence id="3618">One, you have to have an unusual story, because no matter how moving your story is, if it is one of many, the chances are it will not get published.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3619">So, an unusual story is one.</sentence><sentence id="3620">Number two, you have to be able to tell it reasonably well.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="3625">116 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 mean, you can be edited and helped, but reasonably well.</sentence><sentence id="3626">And the most important ingredient is the third one, and that is luck.</sentence><sentence id="3627">Because I don't know, I mean, I feel I've -- as I say in my book, I've been lucky all my life.</sentence><sentence id="3628">Lucky to get out, lucky to be able to get into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, lucky to be able to join the army, lucky to be able to get into an elite assault unit and be able to fight back.</sentence><sentence id="3629">Lucky to survive that.</sentence><sentence id="3630">Lucky to be able to get my book written and accepted by the first publisher.</sentence><sentence id="3631">Lucky to have the movie thing, lucky to have all the other things that are happening in conjunction with it.</sentence><sentence id="3632">So, that's what it ta -- it takes as far as I'm concerned, and look, if the movie doesn't turn out as I would hope it would, or isn't made bef -- as long as I live -- I don't know how these things work -- my wife Alice points out, you've done your thing, you've written your book.</sentence><sentence id="3633">Right now there is a debate raging about -- raging is perhaps an overstatement.</sentence><sentence id="3634">But one of the members of my troop, who was in combat very briefly because he stepped on a <span class="DLF">mine</span> and lost a foot in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, so he was out of it.</sentence><sentence id="3635">He continues his law studies, became a judge in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, which isn't bad for a Jewish refugee boy from Europe, and he's now a retired judge.</sentence><sentence id="3636">And he picked up the ball as it were, when my book came out and he wants us to contribute money to a monument in <span class="REGION">North Wales</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3637">And the -- to my utter shock, the words on it did not include the word Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3638">So I started a sort of agitating, lobbying campaign to enlist support of ex-members of the troop or widows or families to insist that it does include the words Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3639">He -- the judge went so far as to say that my saying a Jewish commandos war against the Nazis in the subtitle was a blur and a s -- and the flaw in my book.</sentence><sentence id="3640">And after I got over the shock and -- and told him off about making such an excessive statement, I had quite the time writing him a letter saying, having been a judge I suppose</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="3644">117 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 you feel you must be judgmental in some direction.</sentence><sentence id="3645">I am slowly beginning to understand where this comes from, and it's very simple.</sentence><sentence id="3646">First of all, this is not <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, where we have just finished talking about the fact that 50 years ago there was overt anti-Semitism.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3647">It has become unfashionable as I say -- as I put it.</sentence><sentence id="3648">It's, in sophisticated circles equally unfashionable in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, but there is the fear of it among Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, apparently.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3649">I'm -- I'm ~ and here's the thing.</sentence><sentence id="3650">When we were first changing our names and becoming a different person, that was rather fun for most of us, because having been a hate object in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, having been a poor refugee, as most of us were, having been in the labor unit, which was the bottom of the army, becoming an elite unit member and wearing the green beret and the parachute wings for which we had qualified, and then knowing we were risking considerable -- our lives, o-our limbs, carried with it a certain satisfaction and pride.</sentence><sentence id="3651">And to be a different person, I mean, I -- I became ultimately, well, a commando, a commando sergeant, an officer in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a good regiment.</sentence><sentence id="3652">And I am Peter Masters and -- and gone is the refugee Peter Arany, you see?</sentence><sentence id="3653">Now, some of them relished that so much that they didn't want to step out of it because they felt it would be stepping back.</sentence><sentence id="3654">And so, to my utter shock, one of my friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> where I spoke at the Church of Scotland church hall, and a classmate of mine from <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> invited lots of people and arranged it so I had a very nice audience.</sentence><sentence id="3655">Yet, a commando friend of mine in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> didn't invite anybody.</sentence><sentence id="3656">And I suddenly realized that the reason he didn't invite anybody is because it would have blown his cover, now.</sentence><sentence id="3657">Because he has a Scottish name.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3658">He has very little accent, much less than I do, and I suppose he can account for that by</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="3662">118 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 our cover story where he was aw -- brought up or something.</sentence><sentence id="3663">He is the president of -- or was, of the local rugby club.</sentence><sentence id="3664">And if -- if he -- if he invited people to something called, "Striking Back: A Jewish Commandos War Against the Nazis," and he was one of the commandos, the thought would occur to them that he too is a Jewish commando from Europe, and he doesn't want to be.</sentence><sentence id="3665">And the judge probably doesn't want to be anything except a retired judge.</sentence><sentence id="3666">And that goes for quite a few.</sentence><sentence id="3667">Now it doesn't go for everybody.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3668">The widow of my friend Harry Nomberg(ph) says who -- whose name is -- is Beatrice Nomberg(ph) and she is from <span

but that it says mostly Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3671">And the judge says that was not a prerequisite for joining the troop.</sentence><sentence id="3672">It was not in the criteria that qualified you and I said, that's true.</sentence><sentence id="3673">But where would they have found German speaking people who wanted to do special and hazardous duty, if it had not been for refugees that were Jewish and German speaking.</sentence><sentence id="3674">And he says, well, some of them were -- were not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3675">They were half Jewish or they were baptized,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3689">Q: Let me go chronologically.</sentence><sentence id="3690">In your professional life we got as far as, I think about 1984.</sentence><sentence id="3691">Can you pick up your professional life from that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3695">A: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="3696">In -- in 1984, I retired.</sentence><sentence id="3697">It was the earliest time that I could retire, and that always brings with it certain f-- financial disadvantages, but I felt it was high time for me to get a -- get out of what had become a rather difficult thing.</sentence><sentence id="3698">The time of enthusiasm that we had had in the -- in the poverty program was long gone.</sentence><sentence id="3699">Even the transformation into wanting to take on the -- the musty look of government and try and brush it up into something more contemporary and positive, that was beginning to ebb away and the fights were more frequent than -- than the -- the -- the challenges.</sentence><sentence id="3700">And there were various -- I -- | -- that's another thing in that period of government, and that is that you can have an administration, a government with which you agree politically, but the person in charge of your agency may not be at all conducive to doing any positive things in -- in what I considered my <span class="DLF">field</span> and my charge.</sentence><sentence id="3701">Or reversely, you might have an administration that is unacceptable politically to you, and you have no choice until next election as it were, and then you may lose.</sentence><sentence id="3702">And the -- a-and yet it might be possible to do some positive things because you have somebody who is interested and who cares.</sentence><sentence id="3703">Now, in the overall,</sentence><sentence id="3705">120 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 in order to improve, and there have been conscious efforts of bringing good design to government, not always, what shall I say, enlightened efforts.</sentence><sentence id="3706">But there were times when Nancy Hanks was in charge of -- of the endowment, and she had a way to get around politicians that was admirable.</sentence><sentence id="3707">And in -- so -- so there -- there were times when it -- when one had the feeling that something worthwhile could be accomplished, and there were other times when it seemed utterly hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="3708">Utterly hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="3709">And we -- I -- I remember -- I remember trying to get -- to come up with a formula a-and saying, well -- o-or -- at least an analysis, a diagnosis of why things were so hopeless at times and it is because the government is made up almost entirely of lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="3710">All right?</sentence><sentence id="3711">Now, I have nothing against lawyers per se, but with the very specialized methodology of American education, unlike some European educations, which in my opinion emphasize general knowledge and a general sort of Renaissance view of not knowing only your subject, but also the arts and literature and music and something of a-at least basic something.</sentence><sentence id="3712">This does not necessarily hold in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3713">And it's perfectly possible to be a brilliant lawyer and have absolutely -- if-- if you were asked to name three American sculptors, they couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="3714">Which is astonishing, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3715">There have been some wonderful ones.</sentence><sentence id="3716">But I mean, ap -- quite apart from that, perhaps the size of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is counterproductive to this kind of thinking because if you ask me to name an artist from every of the 50 states, I probably would have a very</sentence><sentence id="3718">121 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 hard time, because well, because I -- and -- and you see, there are layers of knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="3719">There are people who know a lot about a subject, there are people who know a li--a bit ab -- some, and there are people who know a little and then there are people who know nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3720">And it's perfectly possible to be prominent in one <span class="DLF">field</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and know nothing about the others.</sentence><sentence id="3721">It's a bit shocking, but then there are many shocking things like that, culturally.</sentence><sentence id="3722">I-- 1 -- one of my favorite examples since I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> a few years ago is tell me somebody who knows anything -- anything about Japanese culture, who learned it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3723">Thi-- anything besides "Shogun" and "Madame Butterfly."</sentence><sentence id="3724">Anything about the background of an ancient culture, you see?</sentence><sentence id="3725">And we don't learn it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I guess it's assumed.</sentence><sentence id="3726">I mean, unless you're a specialist, because perhaps it's assumed that there is so much knowledge out there that you can't know it all.</sentence><sentence id="3727"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Computers</span> can change that a bit now, because you can, if you're at all interested, you can look it up in the internet and it's pro -- no doubt in there.</sentence><sentence id="3728">And I wonder to what extent that will spread a degree o-o-of feeling, of general knowledge?</sentence><sentence id="3729">Now, when -- if we don't have a president one day who really cares about the arts, beyond the Kennedy Center Awards, do you think that -- that the arts will flourish all by themselves a-as congress encourages sponsored by corporations, rather than by the endowment and so on?</sentence><sentence id="3730">This is a very tricky subject, you see?</sentence><sentence id="3731">It da -- it -- some of it isn't going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="3732">And if you look back, historically, whether we have had any</sentence><sentence id="3734">122 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 arts in -- in top positions; there's Thomas Jefferson, who was in his own right, an inventive, creative mind that I think overlapped into the arts and certainly into architecture.</sentence><sentence id="3735">What he did at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monticello</span> and at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> i-is -- is admirable.</sentence><sentence id="3736">Can you think of any other ones?</sentence><sentence id="3737">You see, you --I probably don't know enough about some of the intervening ones, but -- but certainly, I mean -- okay, Rockefeller was an art collector and he was vice-president.</sentence><sentence id="3738">Whether he collected --I don't know his motivations.</sentence><sentence id="3739">Mondale's wife was into ceramics, all right?Jackie was into -- int -- into interior decoration, all right?</sentence><sentence id="3740">But -- but going backwards, do you think that Carter, Bush, Reagan?</sentence><sentence id="3741">Well, into <span

[indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="3750">It is marvelous that we are doing as well as we are, because the point -- the center point of the arts has actually shifted to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from -- from Europe, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and perhaps <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3751"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3752">And -- and we are doing amazingly well considering that -- that what I just said holds true.</sentence><sentence id="3753">And when I applied for my <span class="BUILDING">Fulbright</span> you may recall, my</sentence><sentence id="3755">123 Interview with Peter

id="3756">Meaning the first Elizabeth, right?</sentence><sentence id="3757">So, we are doing remarkably well, we could be doing much better still, with more encouragement, with less sort of redneck small town attitudes about the arts being on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of something questionable, and sinful and not quite reputable.</sentence><sentence id="3758">Which is what we are seeing every time the endowment happens to -- to endorse, or not even endorse, but -- but gets marginally involved with a grant that is then used for something that is appalling and shocking.</sentence><sentence id="3759">And of course, that's the chance you take, to some extent.</sentence><sentence id="3760">You can't pre-examine and sense everything you award, and some of them are going to misfire.</sentence><sentence id="3761">So, we get some demonstrative art that's a bit beyond the pale when people shoot themselves in -- in -- in -- in the toes in order to -- yeah, there was some man who -- who considered that demonstrative art, he actually shot holes into himself on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>, or the other one kicked herself in chocolate in the nude, and so on, and this is performance art, you see, but th -- there is much in art that is shocking if it is new.</sentence><sentence id="3762">Some of it is bad.</sentence><sentence id="3763">Well, if you want some good, there's also going to be some bad, th-there has to be freedom.</sentence><sentence id="3764">Now, perhaps one can control that a little bit, but the attempts have been made to go by local standards only.</sentence><sentence id="3765">Well, there are some Noguchi sculptures in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> that the government, General Services Administration under its arts in-- in government buildings program put in, and a local congressman protested that these were pet</sentence><sentence id="3767">124 Interview with Peter Masters September 25, 1998 rocks, because Noguchi takes a stone and works it minimally, but very, very beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="3768">My judgment okay, but not only mine.</sentence><sentence id="3769">And he thought that this was meaningless, and a waste.</sentence><sentence id="3770">And a Sugarman sculpture in a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> was hated by the judge and the judge rules his <span class="BUILDING">court</span> like a-an autocratic ruler.</sentence><sentence id="3771">And he said it was dangerous because it offered hiding places for muggers who would waylay the secretaries when they came from work in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="3772">Well, I mean, these are pretty farfetched criticisms.</sentence><sentence id="3773">He just didn't like that sculpture, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3774">And maybe it was not a nice sculpture, I mean, a-are you going to love all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sculptures</span> equally?</sentence><sentence id="3775">I heard scathing criticism of the <span class="BUILDING">Roosevelt Memorial</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3776">And then I -- and I haven't seen it
