<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Stein.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: John Meyerstein, conducted by Nina Ellis on July first, 2004, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> This is tape number one, side A. Just for the record, would you tell me your name, where you live now, and when and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="8">My name is John Meyerstein.</sentence><sentence id="9">I was originally called Hans Meyerstein, but when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> after the St. Louis voyage, it was suggested to my parents that -- that they give me an English first name, and the name John was chosen, I'm not sure how, and it's -- from that moment onwards it became that, and my parents never used any other name but that, at the time.</sentence><sentence id="10">I currently live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oakville</span>, <span class="REGION">Ontario</span>, which is about 20 miles west of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, on the 21" of March, 1935.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="18">Tell me, do you have many memories of those first years in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: Truthfully I have to say no.</sentence><sentence id="22">I know that some people say that they can remember everything when they were in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pram</span>, or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cradle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">I have to be truthful and say I do not recall those sort of things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="28">Tell me about your parents, their names, and where they were from.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: My father was Ludwig Meyerstein.</sentence><sentence id="32">He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.889212" long="12.247809">Rosslau</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in -- on March the 10", 1893.</sentence><sentence id="33">My mother was Alice Meyerstein, born Alice Eisner, and she was born in a -- a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gutentag</span>, in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, on the 29" of June, 1910.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: And do you know wh-where they met, and how -- how they came to be married?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="42">A: How they met I don't know, I rather suspect it was one of these arranged marriages.</sentence><sentence id="43">Both my families -- both my parent's families were financially very well off, and I can only conclude that it was assumed that this would be a good way of having a marriage.</sentence><sentence id="44">My mother never discussed it, in fact she probably talked to my wife years later on things which she didn't discuss with me.</sentence><sentence id="45">But how they actually met, and -- I don't know, I rather think it was a -- an arranged marriage, but how that was done, if -- if my assessment is correct, I have no idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: And your father served in World War I, I understand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: Yes, he was -- he served in -- four years in -- in World War I, together with an older brother, who also served fo -- four years, and a younger brother, who was also in -- in World War I, but who did not come back, he was killed in -- in 1918, I think, a week or two before Armistice Day, and was listed as missing in action, and never -- never found again, actually.</sentence><sentence id="53">So there were three brothers, of which my father was one, went to the wars, in 1914 - "18, and only two came back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: You know what -- what kind of service your father performed, or where he was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: My -- I-- I -- I think my father's younger brother was in an infantry regiment.</sentence><sentence id="58">My father and his elder brother, Hugo -- and I should say that my father's younger brother, the one who was killed in 1914 - "18, was called Hans, and that was why I was originally called Hans, because my grandmother wanted to have a -- a grandson following that name.</sentence><sentence id="59">My father and his elder brother Hugo both served in cal -- cavalry regiments to begin with, and I s -- I don't know how far the cavalry went, because as you know, things changed, and cavalry re -- regiments then became extinct almost, and presumably went into infantry regiments.</sentence><sentence id="60">My father's elder brother Hugo came out at the end of the war as a captain, and my father ended the war, I think, as a second leftenant.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: Do you know where he served, and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: -- did he see combat?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: | -- I -- I think they both did, I do not know where they served.</sentence><sentence id="71">I believe it was always on the <span class="REGION">western front</span>, because I think that my father would have mentioned something if -- if -- if it had been elsewhere on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="72">I have my father's military b-book, you know, of the class of -- of 19 f -- I can't think what they call it now, class of 1914, or -- or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="73">But it doesn't show exactly where all these things were, it wa -- just like a military record book, which I had years later in the British army, when I was drafted.</sentence><sentence id="74">But I've also since, in the last -- since my father's death, found my grandfather's military book, and he was in the class of 1879, in the militia, in an artillery regiment.</sentence><sentence id="75">So, on my father's side of the family, military activity was not a -- an unusual activity, despite what the -- the Germans said, that there were that few -- not that many Jews volunteered or fought, that was totally incorrect.</sentence><sentence id="76">I do recall that my father mentioned to me that he provi -- that his father, my grandfather, provided the horses, and gave them money and so forth, because in the units which they had to serve, particularly since they ultimately ended up in -- with -- in the commission rank, that required more funding, and my parents were obviously in -- in a position to -- to -- to -- to -- to -- to provide that.</sentence><sentence id="77">The other thing which I found rather interesting, contrary to what I sometimes read, is that my father, on one or two occasions, and these were things which we could always discuss, said to me that when he entered the -- the cavalry regiment, or was in -- was -- w-was organized to go to this unit, that the -- the colonel of the regiment said to him, "Well, Meyerstein, you can't say that there are any anti -- anti-Jews here, otherwise you wouldn't be here."</sentence><sentence id="78">So again, I find it sometimes a bit awkwa -- difficult to understand when I read various documents, as to what took</sentence><sentence id="80">-- actually took place.</sentence><sentence id="81">Obviously there were anti-Jewish Germans, and there were Germans who didn't view this in any shape or form.</sentence><sentence id="82">Whether that's normal, I can't say actually, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="98">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: And they -- and my brother -- and one other thing which I think you might find interesting -- and this was apparently -- this wa -- given to me by my mother, who had a very good relationship in terms of -- of f-friendship with my father's brother, is after World War I, when the German army was reorganized -- this was told by my Uncle Hugo to my mother, they got in touch with my Uncle Hugo, who obviously had a very good military record, and said, "Why don't you come back into the German army?"</sentence><sentence id="101">And he said, "Well, you know, I'm Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="102">And - - and apparently they said to him, "Well, why don't you just say you're Christian, it won't any difference," and -- and left it.</sentence><sentence id="103">He didn't, of course, do that.</sentence><sentence id="104">What I'm getting at it's so peculiar and so strange in what subsequently took place.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: What business was your father's family in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: My father's family had a -- what you would call a small <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.889212" long="12.247809">Rosslau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">They were the only Jewish family in this entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">In fact my grandmother, my f-father's mother, was also born in this -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.889212" long="12.247809">Rosslau</span>, and I have the documents, the birth certificate, and the marriage certificate to my grandfather, also i-in -- in my files.</sentence><sentence id="115">And apparently he was quite successful in that respect, and -- and was continued, I think, until the German -- until the Nazis came to power, and of course ultimately that was all taken away from them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: They were the only Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Huh.</sentence><sentence id="125">So there was no <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> there that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="127">No -- not at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: Were they just full assimilated [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="137">A: Absolute -- I -- I -- I would have to say yes, because I have -- if you look at the birth certificates, and the marriage certificates of both sides of my grandparents, you will find that the names are all traditional German names.</sentence><sentence id="138">M-My father is Ludwig.</sentence><sentence id="139">My elder -- his elder brother Hugo, my -- hi-his younger brother Hans, the one who was killed, and who I was named af -- Hans.</sentence><sentence id="140">My grandmother was named Rosian, which literally trans -- mean little rose.</sentence><sentence id="141">My -- my grandfather was Max.</sentence><sentence id="142">If you look at his parent's birth certificates, it's Magnus, which is really like a Latin name, and the grandmother, I think was -- great-grand -- was Regina.</sentence><sentence id="143">But this also applies to my father's -- grandmother -- my mother's grandparents in like manner.</sentence><sentence id="144">So when people say to me, well what Jewish names did they have, I have to be honest and say I don't honestly know.</sentence><sentence id="145">My mother, for example is Alice, spelled the same way in English as it is in -- in -- in German, except in German it's a different pronunciation.</sentence><sentence id="146">So the documents which I have finally found among my father's papers, after a long time, so far I've -- I've sor -- deciphered that they've gone back to about 1822, and they're all -- the Christian names, the first names, were all literally almost -- you could say either they were English or they were German, but totally integrated.</sentence><sentence id="147">And I suspect that that -- the shock of what subsequent happened, they probably couldn't believe what was taking place.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="149">Your father's family, you said, had a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in that time --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: Well, I would call it a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> in the like manner, and I have seen pictures of it a little bit.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: And your father worked there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: No, my father -- my father became a <span class="BUILDING">barrister</span> and a judge, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span>, where I was ultimately born, practiced criminal law.</sentence><sentence id="154">And ironically -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span> is a very big chemical loca --</sentence><sentence id="156"><span class="REGION">area</span>, even I think to this day.</sentence><sentence id="157">And i-ironically, which I didn't realize, he never discussed it, but my mother mentioned it to me, and also my cousin who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, whose mother is my father's -- was my father's sister, told me that he was also the outside counsel for I.G. Farben, the big German chemical company, which ultimately made the -- the material which was doing the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">Course, this all -- we're not talking about that particular period, we're talking in the -- in the 30's and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="159">So my father had a very successful, an-and according to my mother was a very well known criminal barrister i-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And he would have been there through the 20's?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Ah, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="173">Q: An-And then you were born there in 1934?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: 735.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: deg35 - deg35.</sentence><sentence id="178">And what about your mother's family, what business were they in?</sentence><sentence id="179">You said that they were also --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: My -- my mother's parents lived, as I mentioned, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gutentag</span>, which is an interesting name because it means good day, or good morning -- in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span>, almost on the -- on the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">My -- she had one brother called Lota, and her father was Ludwig Eisner, and my grandmother, my mother's mother, was Rosa Eisner.</sentence><sentence id="182">They owned what you would call a farm equipment wholesale business.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I have pictures, I found pictures.</sentence><sentence id="184">I have no idea how they managed to keep these particular pictures, or bring them with them considering all the other problems which they were experiencing.</sentence><sentence id="185">Where my grandfather had -- you could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> outside his -- th-the fi -- th-the family business and <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, with the telephone number, and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, branded names of things like percil and so forth, even American products.</sentence><sentence id="186">They did farm equipment, I would sort of say, you know, which supplied the farming community, which was</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="196">predominantly Polish speaking, although this Upper S-Silesia was of course <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and had been for 150 years or so.</sentence><sentence id="197">And very successful as well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: So let's start now with -- with -- your father was arrested, I understand, in -- in 1938?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: Well, actually, he was initial -- he was arrested twice.</sentence><sentence id="206">The first ti -- my fa -- my father's sister emigrated with her husband to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> as a result of friends which they had who -- who helped them there.</sentence><sentence id="207">And one of the -- also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, also German Jews.</sentence><sentence id="208">And one of the German Jews had some business things which were required to -- to be handled, and I believe, and this is only -- I'm only surmising this, cause we never di -- I only heard this from my mother, my father took over some activities.</sentence><sentence id="209">This was, or been public perhaps early "38 or so.</sentence><sentence id="210">And for some reason or another, you know, at that time, the -- the German government was already starting to try and take money, or -- and various other things from -- from German -- from German Jews, and their businesses.</sentence><sentence id="211">And he was arrested and held for six weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span> -- but it was obviously nowhere near anything which subsequently took place -- and was released.</sentence><sentence id="212">And then, I think after Kristall night, which was in the latter part of 1938, my father was arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">My mother's father was also arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">My father's -- my mother's brother, Lota, was also arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">And they found each other there, of all -- I mean, most incredible, found each other.</sentence><sentence id="216">All three got out.</sentence><sentence id="217">Now, you have to remember, my father was a first World War veteran, my grandfather, my mother's mother -- father was also a veteran.</sentence><sentence id="218">And I have subsequently read books and documents which indicate that the Germans basically said to some of these people, "Because of your activities as, you know, in World War I, we're going to let you go.</sentence><sentence id="219">But you have so many days or weeks, and if you are still here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, then we -- if when we re-arrest you again, we"|l never -- you" ll never get out."</sentence><sentence id="220">So I believe my father must have got out, probably in early 1939.</sentence><sentence id="221">I don't know which <span class="NPIP">day</span>, and my</sentence><sentence id="223">grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="224">My Uncle Lota also got out, but I don't know exactly when, and under what conditions, but they did, and I have proof of the fact, perma -- documentation that my father then applied for visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in, I think, February of 1939.</sentence><sentence id="225">So between Kristallnacht and entry into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, and now it must have been somewhere between that time, and shall we say the end of January, or -- so he was rather lucky to get out at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Let me go back and ask you when your -- your father's sister left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: That would have been somewhere in 1938, I go -- I believe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: [indecipherable] in the same year, then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: But before Kristallnacht.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Before?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: And it was an escape in a sense, a sense of -- of being unsafe for Jews and the decision to leave [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: Well, I -- yes, I -- I think you're right, but I think the motivating factor might have come more from my aunt's husband, as distinct from other things.</sentence><sentence id="263">My mother has mention -- mentioned to me on several occasions as a boy when I asked questions, that I think sometime in "38 -- when, I don't know, I think before Kristallnacht, okay, that the families got together.</sentence><sentence id="264">My father's family, of which really, was really in my grandmother, because my -- my grandfather on my father's side, died in 1929, so th -- you know, none of this would have applied, got together, and sort of said what we could -- what -- what should we do, because at that time you still, from what I've been given to understand from my mother, you could still take out all your money and belongings without any problems.</sentence><sentence id="265">But they couldn't come to any conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="266">And you have to remember, from my father's side of the family, it was -- I have the documents to the early 1800's</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="274">and my father always used to say to me it was even before, you know whe -- they were more German than the Germans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Okay, if you want to put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="282">Now, I don't th -- I don't think that that was quite as di -- as long on my mother's side of the family, because I understand that from their aspects, my mother's grandfather, m-my gra -- my great-grandfather came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the days when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was under Russian law, and rode across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, into -- into <span class="REGION">Silesia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">Because in those days the Russians used to call people up for military service, and it wasn't just a two year stint, it was 20 years before they were released.</sentence><sentence id="284">So I suspect that they -- his parents, great-great-grandparents, sort of said you'd better get out and -- and -- and go somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="285">But, if you follow what I'm getting at, it's that depth of -- of period.</sentence><sentence id="286">But my parent, when they had the meeting with -- with the two families, obviously couldn't come to lo -- to a conclusion.</sentence><sentence id="287">We're sitting here today saying why not?</sentence><sentence id="288">I can't answer that question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Yeah, yeah. [</sentence><sentence id="298">indecipherable] interesting to know what that conversation was like, what the arguments were [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: | -- I get the impression from her mother that -- th-the -- the women on the one hand wanted to go, and the men -- you have to remember that my father was a very successful barrister, even though things had already declined, I don't know to what degree how far.</sentence><sentence id="300">Everything which I read, where everything is stated, regulations do this, yes it's true, but things still somehow, how did they manage to survive and live with no income coming in?</sentence><sentence id="301">Because although things were tightening, you could still spend money, if you had it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Yeah, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
