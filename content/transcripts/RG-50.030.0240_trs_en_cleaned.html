and she stayed with her a couple of years to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="47">Uh, I would say from "35 to "37.</sentence><sentence id="48">And then she was sent back when Hitler started the rumbles.</sentence><sentence id="49">This was before the Anschluss in 1938 in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">We knew of problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="51">We knew of some problems but no one...no one paid much attention.</sentence><sentence id="52">Everyone felt ah nothing's going to happen to anyone.</sentence><sentence id="53">But we found out later that it did.</sentence><sentence id="54">Because in 1938 when Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and annexed <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> so to speak as part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he started to take the Jews on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">We heard on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>, those of us who had radios, what was going on - the beatings of the Jews, the break-in of the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and that type of hooliganism that was going on.</sentence><sentence id="56">And pretty soon we found the Austrian Jews were running away from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">And my mother took an Austrian lady in to us.</sentence><sentence id="58">We didn't have a huge <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but the five children but we gave her a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> to stay.</sentence><sentence id="59">But most of all I remember is when the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mobilized its armed forces.</sentence><sentence id="60">And the reason for the mobilization was because Hitler wanted to take part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which known to us as Sudetenland into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">He wanted to annex <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">That was a Germanic-speaking part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">And I remember my father was also taken into service, and I still remember the narrow <span class="DLF">street</span> as the five children and our mother walked with our father to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to wish him well, to say goodbye to him.</sentence><sentence id="64">And, of course, the famous Neville Chamberlain quote, "peace in our time."</sentence><sentence id="65">And peace in our time never came; because as soon as he [Chamberlain] probably closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> of 10 Downing Street, Hitler marched not only into <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> but he took over the Czechs, Bohemians, Moravians.</sentence><sentence id="66">But <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, the <span class="REGION">region</span> where I was born, didn't, never seen a Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="67">Nazi soldiers never marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">So what happened with us, the Hlinka Guard, Guard, Hlinka, which H - L - I - N - K - A, was formed, and then in March 15, 1939, is when <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became the puppet government of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="69">The Hlinka Guards, these were people that were our neighbors, people that our parents did business with, that grew up, and lived with practically.</sentence><sentence id="70">They became the Guards.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: O.K., the Guards did what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Guards?</sentence><sentence id="128">Their function was, this was the Nazi-type, almost like an SS-type guards.</sentence><sentence id="129">So what happened with the Jews in particular, of course, only to the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> as a matter of fact, all Jews from the age of six had to wear a yellow Star of David, sewn on the left breast of their outer clothing, with the inscription, Jude, Jew in German.</sentence><sentence id="130">I remember we couldn't, couldn't walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="131">No more than three or four Jews could walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="132">And, of course, curfew.</sentence><sentence id="133">By eight o'clock all of us had to be in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">We couldn't <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, uh, uh, any time we wanted to, only designated hours.</sentence><sentence id="135">And since my father was, uh, a cattle dealer and horse dealer, while my father was, uh, gone, I became, I was the oldest boy, my sister was older than me of course, so I was sort of in charge of knowing some of the millers, some of the flour millers, and go to pick up flour for our family.</sentence><sentence id="136">And you couldn't do it during the day because if you got caught, the Hlinkas would get to you and of course you were punished.</sentence><sentence id="137">Midnights, uh, middle of the nights, was when my mother and I and a couple of other Jewish ladies would go, go to the <span class="BUILDING">miller</span> and pick up flour so we could have bread.</sentence><sentence id="138">And it was all <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, and you always paid through the nose. (</sentence><sentence id="139">Laughter) Everyday there was a new law read to us or posted on, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin boards</span> - they had these little round, uh, <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> where you would come and read the bulletin what happens next to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, we were harassed, beaten on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and of course the <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were taken away from all the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="141">My father business, my father's business was given to the person who worked for him.</sentence><sentence id="142">And my father had to work there to show him how to do the business, to sell the cattle.</sentence><sentence id="143">And my father never believed that anything would happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="144">Almost to the last minute.</sentence><sentence id="145">He said no, he - the reason for that was because most, most of these people, first of all, we were Slovaks, Czechs, we were born there.</sentence><sentence id="146">No one's going to bother us.</sentence><sentence id="147">And second, my father also dealt with the Czechoslovakian government.</sentence><sentence id="148">He sold cattle and horses to the government for, for the armies and that, uh, type of business.</sentence><sentence id="149">So he said no, nothing's going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="150">This will, ah, this will pass.</sentence><sentence id="151">But it didn't.</sentence><sentence id="152">Because we were harassed, we were beaten, and in early 1942, end of 1941, early 1942, we heard that they are going to put us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">There was a rumor at one time, too--which was not even a rumor.</sentence><sentence id="154">Actually it was the truth, that the Jews will be shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span>."</sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, I was a kid, I never knew, I was a small young teenager.</sentence><sentence id="156">But it didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="157">Instead of <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span>, myself, my older sister, and my next brother--Rose, myself and Arpad--were told to report to the <span class="DLF">Town Square</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">All young Jewish boys and girls.</sentence><sentence id="159">When they rounded us up, they told us that we're going back to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, pack our belongings - take food and clothing with you - you're going to be relocated and your parents will join you.</sentence><sentence id="160">They took us about two hours from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitlager</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the name of the camp was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky,</span> N -O- V - A-K - Y, manned by large group of SS, of, uh, Slovakian Hlinka Guards.</sentence><sentence id="163">Mind you, we have yet to see an SS officer.</sentence><sentence id="164">Let me, let me re-track back for a moment if I may.</sentence><sentence id="165">Uh, the first time that have seen German soldiers was when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was invading <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, September Ist, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="166">And how we seen them, the German army was going through <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because we were first and then came <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">But we felt them.</sentence><sentence id="168">My father had to take the cattle from his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stalls</span>, from his, and the horses, and deliver it to the <span class="DLF">Town Square</span> for the German army.</sentence><sentence id="169">Beaten by these, uh, by the Hlinka Guards behind him, going fast, to give this for the Germans to take with them as, as food and and horses for, for carrying their materials, war materials.</sentence><sentence id="170">That was the first time that I'd seen a German soldier.</sentence><sentence id="171">And when we'd seen them on those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> with the side little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and, and, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and horses pulling their, their - that's how we've seen - that's the first time we've seen the Nazi soldiers, the German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="172">This was the Wehrmacht at the time.</sentence><sentence id="173">So, we never had anything to do with them as far as being our guards yet, because our guards were the people that spoke Slovak just like we did.</sentence><sentence id="174">And when we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span>, they loaded us on to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> after we loaded, after we packed our belongings at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">They came with us to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> so we wouldn't run, we wouldn't hide, and they had enough of these guards all over, all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Did you know any of your guards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Oh, absolutely, by names.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Tell me about your conversation with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, they would come, first of all they became ruthless.</sentence><sentence id="232">O.K. The word ""_id" was common.</sentence><sentence id="233">"id" is a Jew. "</sentence><sentence id="234">We finally got you _ids," and that type of words, and beating.</sentence><sentence id="235">They all had clubs and rifles and canes.</sentence><sentence id="236">Whatever they had they would beat you.</sentence><sentence id="237">These were people, this one guy in particular, his name was Martin ek (ph), who was the barber, who was our barber.</sentence><sentence id="238">We used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barbershop</span> - he worked for a Jewish barber called Dezider (ph) " The Jews were never deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Madagascar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="239">Banau, B - A - N - A- U. The poor guy perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but you know.</sentence><sentence id="240">And this Martin ek (ph) was my barber.</sentence><sentence id="241">He cut my hair,

when we arrived to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we seen guards from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">You would go close to him and would ask him nicely, you know, please don't help or something.</sentence><sentence id="245">Boom, the first thing would happen you would get hit.</sentence><sentence id="246">When they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, by, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>, and when we arrived there it was a huge

class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">And we were assigned to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, unloaded our belongings, and then we had to line up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and then the guards would read us the laws.</sentence><sentence id="250">And, by the way, food at the time was still plentiful in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251"><span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was a farm country, so the food was there.</sentence><sentence id="252">The cooks were our people.</sentence><sentence id="253">The Jews became, those who were appointed to be the cooks.</sentence><sentence id="254">We had meat, we had, we had potatoes, we had eggs, we, we still that.</sentence><sentence id="255">And we were also allowed at the time still to be receiving packages.</sentence><sentence id="256">So the parents would send some stuff to us.</sentence><sentence id="257">So that was still allowed because it was our, you know, still in our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">When the next morning when they woke us up and lined us up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, they told us after breakfast, you're going to report to work.</sentence><sentence id="259">What kind of work?</sentence><sentence id="260">Something which really, uh, none, nothing, uh, useful, just carrying bricks or stones and making piles.</sentence><sentence id="261">Because they didn't build anything.</sentence><sentence

where they were digging, some people were digging sand.</sentence><sentence id="264">My job, I was assigned to carrying stones in my bare hands and making a pile.</sentence><sentence id="265">And

was the worst part.</sentence><sentence id="395">Those people who couldn't hold, and then of course the buckets would be over-filled, and there was nothing else you could do, just relieve yourself as close to the comer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> as you possibly could.</sentence><sentence id="396">We stopped once, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>, just the <span

either in German or in Czech or whatever language, line yourself up in rows of five.</sentence><sentence id="417">Of course, all done with beatings by the SS.</sentence><sentence id="418">When they separated the boys from the girls, when we were all lined up in rows of five, everything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi concentration camp</span> was five, because of easier count, and with the Nazis, with the dogs on the side of us, we started to march.</sentence><sentence id="419">I would say a mile and a half maybe.</sentence><sentence id="420">And we came to a <span

the Nazis invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, this part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> used to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish Army

<span class="BUILDING">brick building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="433">They shoved us into the huge <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span>, and there were prisoners and SS telling us what to do next.</sentence><sentence id="434">There was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">The first <span

hang the clothing up.</sentence><sentence id="438">Take our shoes off, put the shoes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="439">Next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> were the barbers, the camp barbers.</sentence><sentence id="440">Where they shaved our head, cut our hair, shaved the entire body.</sentence><sentence id="441">They said this for hygiene.</sentence><sentence id="442">Then we moved to another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> where the tattooing was done.</sentence><sentence id="443">So the tatoo was done on left forearm.</sentence><sentence id="444">There was one person who rubbed the little piece of dirty alcohol on your arm, and the other one had the needle with the inkwell, and he would do the numbering.</sentence><sentence id="445">So my number is 65,316.</sentence><sentence id="446">That means there were 65,315 people numbered before me, tattooed before me.</sentence><sentence id="447">After the tattoo, tattooing was done, they put us, they gave us the clothing, but not what we came with.</sentence><sentence id="448">They gave us, issued us a striped brown cap, a jacket, a striped jacket, a pair of striped trousers, a pair of wooden clogs, and a shirt.</sentence><sentence id="449">No socks or underwear.</sentence><sentence id="450">Then the last <span

wide.</sentence><sentence id="452">And it would star, starred with the Star of David, corresponding with the number on your left forearm, sewn on your left breast and on the right pant leg.</sentence><sentence id="453">And then the last item which was the most important item that we received was a round bowl.</sentence><sentence id="454">And this bowl was the life blood of your being.</sentence><sentence id="455">First of all, without it you couldn't get the meager rations that we got.</sentence><sentence id="456">And second, the bathroom facilities were almost non-existent.</sentence><sentence id="457">Uh, uh, even at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on the bottom had a <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="458">But you couldn't use it.</sentence><sentence id="459">It was only for the privileged.</sentence><sentence id="460">You could use it special times if you were quick, because they only gave you like two, three minutes.</sentence><sentence id="461">But most of us couldn't use it.</sentence><sentence id="462">So, when they gave us the numbers and the bowl, you are now, we were recorded, also by prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="463">This was the, what they call today the Nazi documentation department.</sentence><sentence id="464">These were, they were the officers that did all the paper work.</sentence><sentence id="465">And these were prisoners that worked in the Nazi documentation department.</sentence><sentence id="466">Every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, how many people arrived, and what their names, where they came from, where was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> from, where it originated, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="467">These people were the ones to do that type of work.</sentence><sentence id="468">And most of these people were actually office workers from <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> - bankers, uh, people that worked as accountants possibly.</sentence><sentence id="469">So after they documented all that, we no longer had names.</sentence><sentence id="470">The Nazis called us Haftlings, prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="471">I became Haftling , prisoner 65,316.</sentence><sentence id="472">Then they marched us to our <span

id="479">That guy was the one responsible for that.</sentence><sentence id="480">And everything was done by number.</sentence><sentence id="481">One of the most cruelest things in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called the Appell, the roll call.</sentence><sentence id="482">The roll call in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I will, uh, so many people got killed during roll call, murdered.</sentence><sentence id="483">Many people ran to the <span class="DLF">wires</span> just, just before roll call.</sentence><sentence id="484">Of course even that the Nazis didn't let you do, run to the electric wires and fry.</sentence><sentence id="485">But that was the most cruelest thing.</sentence><sentence id="486">I, I, that was so bad, they would wake you up with beatings anywhere between four and six o'clock in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="487">It depended on how early they got up.</sentence><sentence id="488">And then, you had to line up in rows of five.</sentence><sentence id="489">And the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was counted with the main prisoner, who was called the Lageraltester, the Lager elder, who in most cases was either a, a German criminal or came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="490">I also want to make one thing very strong, very clear.</sentence><sentence

were the ones with the green triangles - then the green triangles were, were the criminals.</sentence><sentence id="493">The red ones were the political prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="494">And we had some red ones also in charge of us.</sentence><sentence id="495">But these people had better way, better living, better uniforms, underwear, regular boots or shoes.</sentence><sentence

killers.</sentence><sentence id="501">And during roll call they would kill many of us.</sentence><sentence id="502">Kill us for the simple reason that someone did it in their pants.</sentence><sentence id="503">They, uh, soiled their pants, soiled their uniform.</sentence><sentence id="504">Poor guy couldn't hold it.</sentence><sentence id="505">Dysentery was, was

had lemons a lot of times from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1095">You know, the lemons would come, they would make hot lemonade.</sentence><sentence

him back.</sentence><sentence id="1105">As close as I'm sitting to you, there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1106">Otto Graff lines the boy up against the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and goes to his neck, and shoots him right here, in front of our eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1107">And he tells us right then and then, this is how you will end up if you try to escape.</sentence><sentence id="1108">And we carried the boy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grundo</span>, I can't think of

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2402">Q: We would also be talking about Mengele and could you tell us about your meetings with Mengele?</sentence><sentence id="2403">I gather you did so often.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2406">A: Yes, well, Mengele arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, not to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, in May 1943.</sentence><sentence id="2407">I still remember when, uh, there too a big fuss was made about the doctors.</sentence><sentence id="2408">The doctors were the ones.</sentence><sentence id="2409">Because in all the <span class="BUILDING">Krankenbaus</span>, all the, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sick bays</span>, where ever they put prisoners, there never doctors.</sentence><sentence id="2410">The only reason doctors came there is to make a selection in who was no longer was fit to be kept alive or selected to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2411">And they had a holding, they was a 7, 11 block in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2412">Block 7 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2413">And this is the <span class="DLF">block</span> that they would take prisoners that were already on their way, on the to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2414">And they would hold them there until they had enough, and then they would just walk them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to, to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2415">So, but mostly I remember Mengele, first about the Mengele selections in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, OK.</sentence><sentence id="2416">Of course, we didn't know when the selection would be.</sentence><sentence id="2417">But all of a sudden, in most cases on a Sundays, cause everyone was in, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2418">The whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was taken out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appellplatz</span>, to roll call place, lined up in rows of five, stripped naked, and your clothing was dropped by you in front of your feet.</sentence><sentence id="2419">And Mengele, with the, with the Lager... Lageraltester, who was a prisoner, and the Lagerfihrer, and also the commandant; they would go from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, block to block.</sentence><sentence id="2420">And behind Mengele was a prisoner registrar--a Schreiber what they called--and as Mengele would, this is how, how it would be.</sentence><sentence id="2421">You in a row of five, always in rows of five.</sentence><sentence id="2422">The first five, step forward.</sentence><sentence id="2423">Mengele would walk in front and in back.</sentence><sentence id="2424">As he walked this way, left or right, left or right, and those who picked up their clothing were still staying alive, because, we didn't know, we found out later how it worked.</sentence><sentence id="2425">First, first time, second time, you didn't know which, what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2426">If you living or if you going to die now.</sentence><sentence id="2427">Those who left their clothing were taken into a <span class="DLF">holding block</span> and Mengele's selections would last practically all day because by the time he completed - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was a huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> - by the time he completed the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, OK, after he finished the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, those who of course the clothing stayed behind were taken into another <span class="DLF">block</span> and waited until everybody was taken from all, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, then they were standing there.</sentence><sentence id="2428">You could hear them yell, scream, and beg for water, beg for, for help.</sentence><sentence id="2429">They knew where they were going see.</sentence><sentence id="2430">See, and those of us who stayed, we picked up our clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2431">Then with whips and sticks by the SS and by the Kapos and by the Blockaltester, by the Stubedienst, all the big-wigs of the prisoners and the SS, we were beaten into a, uh, <span class="INT_SPACE">shower area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2432">And we bundled our clothing with a piece of wire with the number <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and threw them in a huge <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, in, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, where Zyklon B gas was put on the clothing to disinfect the clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2433">They disinfected the clothing while they disinfected us.</sentence><sentence id="2434">Spray a little water and they sprayed us with some disinfecting, uh, water, some sort of a disinfecter.</sentence><sentence id="2435">And then they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where, where the clothing was, and you started looking for your clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2436">But the gas fumes were still there.</sentence><sentence id="2437">And I'll never forget, I got weak and dizzy from the gas fumes one time.</sentence><sentence id="2438">And, uh, I was fainting and my friend, Buchler and Fisher, which I mentioned before, grabbed me under their arms and took me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and ran me back and forth, breathing for <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2439">And that's how they got me through.</sentence><sentence id="2440">That's how I came out of that.</sentence><sentence id="2441">I already had enough gas in me so 7 if, if those two boys weren't there I wouldn't be alive.</sentence><sentence id="2442">I would have died right there.</sentence><sentence id="2443">So we picked up our clothing, we put our clothing on, were taken back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, back to our own <span class="DLF">blocks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2444">The other thing I remember about Mengele very vividly is when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were coming in.</sentence><sentence id="2445">He was the one who would be in charge at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, at the <span class="DLF">siding</span>, at, at what they, the Nazis called it the Rampe, the <span class="DLF">ramp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2446">When he came to the <span class="DLF">ramp</span>, the first thing he would do when he, when he, he had the people lined up, the able-bodied ones, he would get rid of those first.</sentence><sentence id="2447">He would ask them, how old are you, what is your profession, what is your name, , what is your profession and how old are you.</sentence><sentence id="2448">And left, right, left, right and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2449">After he got rid of all these, of course, another thing he was looking, pregnant women and twins.</sentence><sentence id="2450">We really didn't know what he was doing with them at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2451">But he would, he called them "Schlingen" (ph) [Zwillingen?],</sentence><sentence id="2452">the twins.</sentence><sentence id="2453">He would take the twins into his <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2454">I would see Mengele every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and especially in early May 1944 when the Hungarian Jews were brought in.</sentence><sentence id="2455">When the Hungarian Jews came, Mengele was there constantly.</sentence><sentence id="2456">He had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>, and he would ride in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, up and down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, just looking, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>, looking for anything that he wanted to look at.</sentence><sentence id="2457">Of course, we didn't know what he was looking at.</sentence><sentence id="2458">Always afraid of this man.</sentence><sentence id="2459">I can still remember his, his piercing eyes and he'll, he'll, Mengele had dark hair and when he, when he, there were two people that we were deathly afraid of.</sentence><sentence id="2460">Actually three.</sentence><sentence id="2461">Palich (ph) was one.</sentence><sentence id="2462">Palich was another one who was.</sentence><sentence id="2463">He, Palich actually did this.</sentence><sentence id="2464">Palici's favorite thing was to do to line people up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>--Auschwitz I-- against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to see how many he could kill with one bullet.</sentence><sentence id="2465">A friend of mine, close friend of mine, knew of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palish</span> quite well.</sentence><sentence id="2466">I didn't know much about Palish except I knew who he was, that he was a murderer, and he also ride, rode a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2467">He would line up people, two three people in a row, see how many he could kill with one bullet.</sentence><sentence id="2468">Lined them up together.</sentence><sentence id="2469">And the third person, who also came in "43, actually end of "43 I think, whose name was Hauptsturmfiihrer Moll, M - O - L - L. He became in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2470">And also, he also was the mentor of the <span class="DLF">pits</span>, the <span class="DLF">pits</span> that they were digging because the <span class="BUILDING">crematorias</span> couldn't, couldn't hold enough people, burn and gas enough people fast enough.</sentence><sentence id="2471">So he used the <span class="DLF">pits</span> to burn the people.</sentence><sentence id="2472">But the <span class="DLF">pits</span> didn't work well.</sentence><sentence id="2473">Because I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Greek transports</span> that came and and he, he took some of the Greek boys working the <span class="DLF">pits</span> and with bare feet they were, they were stomping the hot ashes for after the people, the hot coals after the people were, were burned in there.</sentence><sentence id="2474">And the bodies just kept, kept coming back up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
