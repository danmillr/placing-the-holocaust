our life interesting and also the lessons that they teach were very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="54">When we studied about the French Revolution, they made like a mock judgment and we were discussing about____------ head rolled, and in no time we knew what was going on with...without worrying about the book.</sentence><sentence id="55">And this...I had a little...uh...I had a very big

compassionate person.</sentence><sentence id="62">She had a very big clientele, and I remember rich landowners coming in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and with those little...uh...horse...horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span>, and...and those tall, strong, Polish men were just kissing my mother's hand because she was such a good dentist.</sentence><sentence id="63">And they used to bring all kinds of presents, but on the other hand the poor people around us knew if they have a toothache or they have a any problem, they just come, ring the bell and come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and my mother would never ask them how much they can pay.</sentence><sentence id="64">They pay how much they could, and if they couldn't pay it was alright also.</sentence><sentence id="65">So she always imbedded in our mind the concept of charity.</sentence><sentence id="66">This idyllic life lasted through 1935, and this was the time when I started to feel the wind of anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="67">My father...my father was working as a registered pharmacist in a very big <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> that was a <span class="BUILDING">government pharmacy</span> from the social services.</sentence><sentence id="68">Every worker was involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="69">Only 3 Jewish

class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and work and study.</sentence><sentence id="76">He used to go on field trips because the old fashioned pharmacist didn't go and just and pick up the medicine from the <span class="DLF">shelves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">They have to prepare it.</sentence><sentence id="78">And finally when the tests came...uh...there was an oral test and there was a written test.</sentence><sentence id="79">The man...the professor that gave him the test was a known anti-Semite and my father was very afraid that he won't pass the test.</sentence><sentence id="80">But he passed the test with flying colors.</sentence><sentence id="81">The written test and the oral.</sentence><sentence id="82">And as he was getting up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>...he was practically by the <span class="DLF">door</span>, after he...telling him about so many complicated chemicals formula and everything, all of sudden, the professor asked him, "David ___, and what is the chemical...uh...formula for carbonated water with the C2 03, and my father was so nervous and so upset that he got a mental block and he couldn't answer him.</sentence><sentence id="83">And he just didn't pass him.</sentence><sentence id="84">So, of course, he had to study enough and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and after a short time we got the telegram he did pass it.</sentence><sentence id="85">But after a very short time, a decree came and Jews were not allowed to work as pharmacist in a <span class="BUILDING">government institution</span>, and my father lost his job.</sentence><sentence id="86">I didn't tell you that my...my father had a brother and two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="87">And my...my grandparents on

only in white.</sentence><sentence id="88">Even...only in white, even if they grew...grow up and be able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">And when the child will ask you, "Mama, how come everybody dresses in all kinds of different colors and I'm wearing in white...I'm dressed in white," then you can take off and dress the child in any colors.</sentence><sentence id="90">And this what happened.</sentence><sentence id="91">And she...the 13 and the 14 and 15 and the 16th child survived because she kept them in white.</sentence><sentence id="92">And my...my father had a brother and two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="93">The...the...the...the younger brother immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> with one of the sisters went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and one of the sisters lived with her parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and this...this...I just wanted to mention it because this was something happening and we were talking about this in the family.</sentence><sentence id="94">And so coming back to 1935 when my father lost his job, we...my mother had a very close knit family.</sentence><sentence id="95">And, as I mentioned before, they were upper middle class, and they were six children, two brothers and four sisters.</sentence><sentence id="96">One sister, as a young girl, got married and immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">One sister got married to a very rich man that was a manufacturer of papers and...uh...my oldest, my mother's oldest sister was a registered nurse.</sentence><sentence id="98">Her name was Sonia Lipquwich Perski, and she was

happened, the whole family got together.</sentence><sentence id="102">It was like a family council and they decided that my father has to get to himself together and buy himself a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">He couldn't buy a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilno</span>, but they found for him a <span

id="104">They didn't want to sell a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> to a Jewish pharmacist.</sentence><sentence id="105">So imagine a pharmacist, a Christian of Polish persuasion had to be found, a sum of money collected by the family had to given to him and his name the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> was bought.</sentence><sentence id="106">This happened in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="107">And my...my...actually my family split because my mother and my sister had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soley</span> and find an <span
