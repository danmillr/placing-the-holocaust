It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that's about 23 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, about ten kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schnaittach</span>, after which we are named, and it had a population of 1,100.</sentence><sentence id="5">At the time I was born it might have had ten or fifteen Jewish families.</sentence><sentence id="6">By the time I left, it had dwindled to eight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: I need some dates here.</sentence><sentence id="13">What year were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="16">A: I was born in July of 1913 and left -- an interesting part of the development of young Jews at that particular time was that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> only provided elementary education.</sentence><sentence id="17">During the first three years of my life, I was in a one room school house which was staffed by a teacher who was Jewish who acted also as a cantor and an insurance agent on the side.</sentence><sentence id="18">Finally, the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> could no longer afford this teacher, and we were transferred at the third year of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">government school</span>, which was largely a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span>, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> also had a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">I lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span> until it became necessary for the purpose of getting a better education to go to a so called Pensionat, a glorified <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">My mother, who then had been a war widow, had to give me up just like she gave up her elder son, my brother Mike, who also went to this Pensionat in order to go from there to a Realschule, or in my case, ultimately to a <span class="BUILDING">commercial high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">It is interesting to note that because of coming from a <span class="BUILDING">village elementary school</span>, I had to undergo an entrance examination into the then what we considered preferable the <span class="BUILDING">Realschule</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> providing education in languages, math, etc.</sentence><sentence id="22">But anti-semitism back in 1923 in that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had risen to the extent where the director of the <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> saw fit to transfer me from there to the <span class="BUILDING">commercial high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">Life continued as a student and the practice was to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on vacation and holidays and of course that was a double holiday to be spent with my mother and spinster aunts who housed the family.</sentence><sentence id="24">After graduation, at the age of 17, I went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">wholesale establishment</span> for the sale of household goods and toys.</sentence><sentence id="25">This would have brought us up to the year 1930.</sentence><sentence id="26">In these intervening years, Nazism grew, but it did attain the imminent danger of the overthrow of the Weimar Republic.</sentence><sentence id="27">The years 1932 indeed seemed to from my memory and as a youngster, seemed to reflect a decrease in the significance of the Nazi party.</sentence><sentence id="28">There was an election in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schleswig-Holstein</span> which indicated for the first time a decrease in the electoral votes that the Nazis got.</sentence><sentence id="29">This presented the urgency to Hindenberg to appoint Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933.</sentence><sentence id="30">That changed the situation radically.</sentence><sentence id="31">Immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor, forms of oppression of terror began to ensue not as yet outwardly against the Jews, but most of all against social democrats and communists, anti- fascist forces.</sentence><sentence id="32">In order to give the appointment of Hitler's Chancellor the democratic appearance, the election of March 6, 1933 was called.</sentence><sentence id="33">The disunity on the left and the support of the Nazi movement by German nationalists brought about the so-called electoral victory confirming Hitler in the position of Chancellor.</sentence><sentence id="34">Thereafter, really, the efforts began to denude <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of human rights, of civil rights, of democratic rights.</sentence><sentence id="35">Now, shall I swing over the time of the arrest?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Not yet.</sentence><sentence id="57">What I would like to ask you is prior to this period of time, did you have any trouble with people as a Jew?</sentence><sentence id="58">Did you come from a <span class="BUILDING">religious family</span>?</sentence><sentence id="59">Did you mix well with your German neighbors?</sentence><sentence id="60">What was it like before Hitler?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: What was social life in a community such as the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or for that matter social life in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Now, I can speak of it from only a very limited point of view.</sentence><sentence id="68">As far as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was concerned, after we had left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we hardly -- we only would socialize and to a very limited scale with young people whom we knew to be anti-Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="69">The few -- I shouldn't say few, there were quite a few social democrats and those were the only people that we socialized with.</sentence><sentence id="70">Earlier on, during the years that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span>, we would play soccer yet with everyone.</sentence><sentence id="71">That was until say 1930.</sentence><sentence id="72">From then on, the <span class="DLF">lines</span> were beginning to be drawn much more severely.</sentence><sentence id="73">Now, the question could be raised why would it be called for that a young man who is working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and during the week lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> over weekends.</sentence><sentence id="74">Well, obviously one was drawn first of all by the family and one didn't have the opportunity to one as a Jew to form broad social friendships.</sentence><sentence id="75">It was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="76">My family was not a orthodox Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="77">It practiced traditional Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="78">| at one time through my growing up period had developed a spirit of orthodoxy in deed until I became some sixteen, seventeen years old and I lost it.</sentence><sentence id="79">| became agnostic.</sentence><sentence id="80">Our social life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> centered around a German Jewish Youth movement which believed in ideas of humanity and yet we were able to enjoy life, until truly the radical changes took place in the beginning of 1933.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Did you experience any abuse or attacks verbal or otherwise?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: The changes in 1933 that I indicated which came about were demonstrated immediately after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on January 30.</sentence><sentence id="225">The very following day there were demonstrations of stormtroopers along the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I worked and the call went out close your <span class="DLF">windows</span> or we shall shoot.</sentence><sentence id="226">On the same <span class="DLF">street</span> there had been the editorial and <span class="BUILDING">printing offices</span> of the social democratic newspaper which had been destroyed on this occasion.</sentence><sentence id="227">On top of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> were the <span class="INT_SPACE">offices</span> of people that the company that we had been doing business with.</sentence><sentence id="228">I forgot the name.</sentence><sentence id="229">They were wholesalers in textiles, and I took it upon myself to ask the stormtroopers who had been guarding the Social Democratic newspaper in order to visit the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of this particular company which was owned by Jewish people, and I was greeted with a deep feeling of dismay and despair because their goods were stolen.</sentence><sentence id="230">Their goods were thrown out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> to stormtroopers who were waiting downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="231">That was the beginning, only the very beginning of it and you could during the time of the announcement of elections to be held on March 6, 1933, during these short five weeks election rallies of the opposition were prohibited.</sentence><sentence id="232">So, it really began rapidly to spread fear and hopelessness in the circles of the anti-Nazi movement.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: What were you afraid of?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: I was afraid of physical persecution, of being beaten up and the beatings that they rendered were severe.</sentence><sentence id="245">After the --if you were accused of anti-Nazi activities you were likely to be sent to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and after all that didn't take long.</sentence><sentence id="246">On March the 26th, twenty days after the election, when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on my weekly weekend visit to my mother, I was settled down and we would have a cup of coffee.</sentence><sentence id="247">My mother had a bad cold, but we were happy to see each other.</sentence><sentence id="248">That happiness lasted but a few minutes, and there was a hard knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and there was the gendarme, who said, "Herr Schnaittacher, come with me to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>."</sentence><sentence id="249">I asked why to no avail; no answer.</sentence><sentence id="250">I had no alternative but to follow him.</sentence><sentence id="251">That was in what would have been the purpose of saying no I'm not going with you not without an arrest warrant.</sentence><sentence id="252">This is authority.</sentence><sentence id="253">I followed him to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, and as we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> he said, "Herr Schnaittacher, you're under arrest."</sentence><sentence id="254">I said, "Why?"</sentence><sentence id="255">No answer.</sentence><sentence id="256">I said can I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to say goodbye to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="257">He said no.</sentence><sentence id="258">I said can I call my mother?</sentence><sentence id="259">He said here use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">It was probably one of the most difficult and painful telephone calls I've had to make in my life. "</sentence><sentence id="261">Mother, I'm under arrest."</sentence><sentence id="262">You could have heard her shriek to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">We lived quite a distance from it.</sentence><sentence id="264">She came storming out, protesting, but all to no avail.</sentence><sentence id="265">An hour later, after the policeman asked me whether I carried weapons on me, and I had a little knife and he said you better give it to me so it couldn't be used as evidence.</sentence><sentence id="266">After an hour I was transported by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> didn't have a regular <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and I was transported to the county seat of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erlangen</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university city</span> and a county seat, and I was delivered to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">The warden received me, assigned me to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and dusk began to settle and the <span class="DLF">cell door</span> opened and I was put in to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> that consisted of a wooden board that we slept on, a bucket, and you can imagine what it was for, and three pitchers of water and water basins for drinking and washing.</sentence><sentence id="269">It was inhabited by two other men, one a communist, one a socialists.</sentence><sentence id="270">All of them were at least double my age.</sentence><sentence id="271">I wasn't twenty, yet.</sentence><sentence id="272">And, so here I was.</sentence><sentence id="273">It wasn't a incarceration that could be in the terms that we subsequently learned inhuman, it was deadening.</sentence><sentence id="274">There was very simple sometimes inedible food.</sentence><sentence id="275">The living conditions were very primitive.</sentence><sentence id="276">We then were assigned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and a blanket.</sentence><sentence id="277">It wasn't without humor and I might relate these two little stories.</sentence><sentence id="278">The first morning and I didn't need sleeping pills then, which I do now, the first morning my cellmates very humanly gave me the easiest job and that was to fill the water buckets.</sentence><sentence id="279">There was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faucet</span> with running water in the long <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> that opened up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">And as a I stood there filling the pitchers with water and I turned around and who was sitting in the adjoining <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> but my second cousin from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">So what they had done was they had the humanity of only arresting the two young male Jews instead of all the others.</sentence><sentence id="282">The other little story is headed under humor.</sentence><sentence id="283">A few days after we had been brought in we saw on our daily walk in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> which was important because we had no exercise otherwise, there was a young kid, even younger than I was who told us the story that he had been picked up in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> as a vagrant, for vagrancy, and one day as he came down he clapped his hands out of pure joy.</sentence><sentence id="284">Why?</sentence><sentence id="285">Because he saw the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who had arrested him now also in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">This is in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> Schadenfreude, what is best English translation, "spiteful joy."</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="332">A: Okay, the charges for my arrested and I insisted and finally they were given to me.</sentence><sentence id="333">I was accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government, knowledge of secret <span class="DLF">ammunition dumps</span>, and liaison man of secret anti-Nazi organizations.</sentence><sentence id="334">I remotely could have been accused of agitation against the National Socialist Government well it was perfectly legal.</sentence><sentence id="335">Thereafter I desisted of any political activity.</sentence><sentence id="336">I had been an anti-fascist throughout.</sentence><sentence id="337">My conscience dictated it to me.</sentence><sentence id="338">From the moment that I had been arrested, my mother did not rest for a moment, until she succeeded in setting us free.</sentence><sentence id="339">That came about through her contact with the Sturmbahnfihrer and the higher officer of the S.A. who three weeks after we had been in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> came to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> to look me over and after he saw me in my stocking feet, pants and shirt, he said you don't

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: Well, as far as my rank was concerned, when you become a commissioned officer it's called great.</sentence><sentence id="674">I was a Second Lieutenant at the time that I joined the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th National Guard Division of Oklahoma.</sentence><sentence id="675">The 45th Division was the Oklahoma National Guard Division, one of the most battle tested outfits in the war.</sentence><sentence id="676">It had a 400 percent, if that is claim to fame 400 percent casualty turnover.</sentence><sentence id="677">It was one of three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">divisions</span> that was used in the attack.</sentence><sentence id="678">The 36th and the 3rd and the 45th.</sentence><sentence id="679">A division consisted at that time of roughly 20,000 men consisting of three regiments each regiment had three battalion and each battalion had four companies.</sentence><sentence id="680">Whether that is different now, I do not know.</sentence><sentence id="681">Our specific purposes, and I say our, the I.P.W. specific purpose was to receive prisoners as early as possible out of the chaos of battle in order to get the truth of whatever information they were able to give and it was up to us to discern and as we began to accumulate information from the many, many prisoners that we were able to learn truth from fiction because we knew a lot of the information that they had had and could balance it off and very few because of the tactics we had learned would refuse to provide us with the information we were seeking.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="691">Q: How did you do that?</sentence><sentence id="692">What kind of tactics?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="695">A: Rule number one--and you're testing my memory--rule number one was never to ask a question that you could answer with yes or no.</sentence><sentence id="696">Revealing information that we have had and formulating a question accordingly.</sentence><sentence id="697">Speaking to them in the dialect that they were accustomed to because we had sensitive ears and we knew the dialects all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and if we were able to speak we were able to locate them and thereby develop a relationship that created a degree of confidence and willingness to give.</sentence><sentence id="698">The morale of the German Army began to be sure once we entered German proper, began to deteriorate rapidly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="703">Q: One other question and then I want you tell me where you went.</sentence><sentence id="704">Did you go over there with any trepidation or great eagerness to take this assignment on.</sentence><sentence id="705">Do you remember what you were feeling at the time when you were just not another American soldier.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="709">A: I to the best of my recollection I went with a degree of eagerness because it was one way that I truly could contribute to the effort of destroying Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="710">To be sure I needed to learn.</sentence><sentence id="711">I never forget a first attempt, my first attempt to interrogate prisoners and then to report the results of my interrogation to the general in charge of our regiment, who had been accustomed to the battle wise master sergeant, who had furnished him information through many campaigns, from <span class="REGION">Africa</span> or <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> up to , and here he now turns to the brand new chickenshit second lieutenant, he says well Lieutenant what did you learn?</sentence><sentence id="712">I told him fanciful stories that there of enormous strategic importance and with dismay he turned away from me and says my buddy's name master sergeant was Fritz, he says, "Fritz, what do you know?"</sentence><sentence id="713">But it changed rapidly and with due modesty I became an expert.</sentence><sentence id="714">Yet, the most 4 successful interrogation that I had was when I couldn't ask questions.</sentence><sentence id="715">On March 15, 1945, we had a company of ours had broken through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> into one of the deep enormously strong fortifications.</sentence><sentence id="716">My regimental intelligence officer came to me and said, "Lieutenant, this is beyond the call of duty, but if you care to, and Fritz we would like you to go up and the company has occupied the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and they hear voices on the telephone system but they can't make them out."</sentence><sentence id="717">So, we did and it was a very active night.</sentence><sentence id="718">There was a lot of firing going on, but we made it.</sentence><sentence id="719">The moment I picked up the received and then relayed the information to my buddy, one sergeant from a German outfit who identified himself and his outfit reported to an officer of another outfit identifying the outfit indicating the route of withdrawal, the next day's ammunition dump, the location of the <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span>, the <span class="DLF">refueling dump</span>, any question that I could have possibly asked that was of material tactical information was revealed and the following day we were able, not only because of our information but other information that came in to slice totally through the <span class="DLF">Siegfried Line</span> and advance by some 30 miles.</sentence><sentence id="720">That was a proud day.</sentence><sentence id="721">From then on, we moved very rapidly and we moved along a <span class="DLF">line</span> that could hardly have been designed any better had I volunteered or had I been asked because of my personal knowledge of <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">The first such <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we occupied that we conquered, was <span

id="723">Indeed, my buddy and I took on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> -- no let me clarify something.</sentence><sentence id="724">Under the command my buddy and I under the command of Colonel O'Brien we accepted as interpreters the surrender of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aschaffenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="725">We then took the commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aschaffenburg</span>, who the day before had strung up several officers who had wanted to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="726">We put them on the front of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and he drove with us into <span class="REGION">areas</span> that had not been occupied yet by our troops, and then we were stopped.</sentence><sentence id="727">He said, put your arms down and they had one American prisoner to whom he gave a gun, and we disarmed.</sentence><sentence id="728">They disarmed voluntarily.</sentence><sentence id="729">A platoon of at least 30 or 40 men and this one American soldier, G.I. with a German rifle marched this unit back to the American P.W. cage.</sentence><sentence id="730">We moved quickly and other points of interest were only days later when I had a group of six prisoners in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="731">One of them stepped out and said, "Lieutenant, didn't we go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together?"</sentence><sentence id="732">I picked up his helmet and I said "By God, Leslach, we did."</sentence><sentence id="733">I have a picture still here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a class picture of 1929 or 1928 with a picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leslach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">He had been a decent guy and he said, "Couldn't you let me go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="735">I love my wife so much."</sentence><sentence id="736">I said, "I love mine too, but I can't let you go <span

because militarily speaking we had more information than they did.</sentence><sentence id="740">It was a pure coincidence that one out of these 800 stepped up to me and said, "Couldn't you let me go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="741">I come from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not far from here.</sentence><sentence id="742">And I said, "My, where are

use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span>, not to drive it, I had a driver.</sentence><sentence id="900">By then I was a first lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="901">I drove out to this little

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> gave me the opportunity also to meet the friend of the family, and that was a very joyous occasion.</sentence><sentence id="912">She had been working as the housekeeper for my aunt and she was overjoyed to see me and overjoyed about the end of the oppressive system.</sentence><sentence id="913">Another somewhat humorous experience reflecting upon some key reporters was the following.</sentence><sentence id="914">My division commander had learned that I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> prior to the war, and so I was ordered to come to him and he said Schnaittacher I understand you had lived here before.</sentence><sentence id="915">We are expecting a bunch of newspaper men, congressmen senators, all kinds of bigwigs that want to see the birthplace of Nazism and I want you to be their guide.</sentence><sentence id="916">So I took this group on the trip and I started with the <span class="DLF">Odeonsplatz</span>, which is the square where the Putsch had taken place in 1923 which had failed, and the legend went that courageous Hitler as firing started quickly left his troops and hid behind one of two statues and one of these key reporters profoundly thought so nothing more important to ask behind which one.</sentence><sentence id="917">The other little story goes to the <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> where the Putsch had started in 1923 and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">beer hall</span> there was an <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> which was filled to some degree with stuff which had been stolen from <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="918">Amongst them was a statue of a storm trooper standing on a swastika with a German eagle and the other key reporter raised the statue and said, "Did this come from a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span>, too?"</sentence><sentence id="919">This I could only laugh at.</sentence><sentence id="920">My stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> was then a brief one.</sentence><sentence id="921">I participated in the surrender of the Hungarian Army and I do remember at the behest of my general and I do remember that the Hungarian general was really only interested in his men but in his two horses.</sentence><sentence id="922">Memories.</sentence><sentence id="923">Thereafter, I was assigned to a <span

which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American P.W. camp</span> of so called automatic arrests.</sentence><sentence id="924">This was a very wise law that Eisenhower had released early after combat.</sentence><sentence id="925">Classifications of people would be subject to automatic arrest.</sentence><sentence id="926">Nothing noteworthy happened other than one general who revealed something that I had had no idea of that they were working on the ultimate secret weapon but I didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="927">Then after a brief rest in a rest area, I was transferred to the War Crimes Commission.</sentence></p></dialogue>
