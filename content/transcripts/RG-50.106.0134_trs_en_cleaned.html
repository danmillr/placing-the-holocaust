<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: Well, i-it -- it was tough, I'm sure it was not any tougher than anybody -- but hindsight it doesn't seem so tough.</sentence><sentence id="848">At the time I -- I -- 1 remember, because one of the biggest problem was - - again, it's very hard to compare it to -- to 1999 or 2000, is because the amount of money people</sentence><sentence id="850">7 are making is -- was just entirely different level, you know, it was --- it was true everything was - - a -- a lot of things were less expensive, but it was very hard to make -- make money and keep it, because things -- things were difficult, especially like in my case, you know, I'm sure that there were a lot of people, i-immigrants like myself had the same problem, nobody helped you period, whether it -- but -- which was okay because I wanted to be self reliant.</sentence><sentence id="851">However, in some cases people come, they get big wedding gifts, or they get a start here, they gotta push there.</sentence><sentence id="852">Like I had a friend, he was complaining about his father-in-law [indecipherable], but he would buy him carpeting for the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, or -- or buy him a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>, or whatever, were -- were -- or -- or turned over the business to him, whatever, I didn't have that.</sentence><sentence id="853">So it was i-in a sense struggle.</sentence><sentence id="854">On the other hand, why should I look for some -- someone else to give it to me, you know, it's simple as -- as far as I'm concerned, it's okay.</sentence><sentence id="855">But it was tough, because the amount of money you made or you've been able to keep was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="856">And in that respect, I guess it was tough, but I imagine that most people had -- didn't have it much different.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="873">Q: And how did you decide to retire?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="875">A: Well again, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and we -- I was there like 25 years and the <span class="REGION">real estate</span> -- the shopping center was sold to another company and the first thing the new company came in, they took over, they wanted to triple my rent, which I could -- definitely could not afford.</sentence><sentence id="876">And by now the business also was suffering, cause I was in the meat business and the cholesterol thing came on very quickly, very strong, and all of a sudden the demand, plus the competition was just too much to -- to absorb, because the demand just dropped, and -- while the competition was</sentence><sentence id="878">8 increasing.</sentence><sentence id="879">I was in an <span class="REGION">area</span>, it was a very competitive area.</sentence><sentence id="880">There was like four or five <span class="BUILDING">supermarkets</span> within a couple of miles of me.</sentence><sentence id="881">But for the longest time I held out, but with a reduction of meat consumption, it was going down.</sentence><sentence id="882">So then when the new landlord came in, and he demanded almost triple rent, plus extra added expenses, I just felt I couldn't afford to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="883">So I retired prematurely; I really wanted to stay in <span class="BUILDING">business</span> another four or five years.</sentence><sentence id="884">And -- so once -- which worried me, because I didn't think I could afford it economically.</sentence><sentence id="885">But somehow or another, once I saw that I had to go, I made the best of it and so far so good.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="909">A: -- I thought I would have a problem with that.</sentence><sentence id="910">As it turns out I don't have a -- I -- I adjusted very easily.</sentence><sentence id="911">I amazed myself.</sentence><sentence id="912">I will say -- after I retired, I did, when I got out of business, I did go part time.</sentence><sentence id="913">I worked for a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> for -- periodically.</sentence><sentence id="914">And when I didn't work there I worked someplace else, couple of -- two or three days a week or so, and now that I moved here actually, I'm also doing -- basically still doing the same thing, I'm working a little bit, part time and then I volunteer and I do things.</sentence><sentence id="915">I'm not bored.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="923">Q: Now, what -- what work do you do part time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="925">A: Actually, right now I work -- I do some consulting, like for the food industry, like <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span></sentence><sentence id="927">9 and sup -- <span class="BUILDING">food stores</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: Like, for example, how -- how would that work?</sentence><sentence id="933">A client comes --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: Well, like somebody wants to set up a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, so I help them set it up.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="935">Q: And how do they found you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="937">A: Well, I find them, really --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="938">Q: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="939">A: -- most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="940">Because when I came here I -- it took a long -- I did some of it in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>, but when I came here I didn't know the <span class="REGION">area</span>, I didn't know where to start.</sentence><sentence id="941">So it's a little - - I didn't depend on it too much.</sentence><sentence id="942">So I started working actually one day in <span class="BUILDING">Katz's</span>.</sentence><sentence id="943">Here I walked in one day and he asked me if I could help him out, I got to talk to him.</sentence><sentence id="944">And I started helping him out, I'm still there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="951">Q: Wh-Where is this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="953">A: <span class="BUILDING">Katz's market</span> in -- a <span class="BUILDING">kosher market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="954">So I'm there -- whenever I want to work, I ge -- he and I have an arrangement, when I -- if I want to work, I work and if I don't, I don't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="957">Q: And when you want to work, what -- what does ti --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="958">A: So I go in --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: What work do you do when you want to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="960">A: I work in the <span class="BUILDING">service counter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="961">Th-Th -- they sell meat, you know, so I --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="962">Q: Okay</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: -- do service.</sentence><sentence id="964">So I put in like three days a week on average, two or three days a week.</sentence><sentence id="965">And what's nice about it, I -- Iam not committed where I have to, you know, I -- I work -- whenever I'm free, I work.</sentence><sentence id="966">So this way I could do what I want to do, still I work a little bit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="975">Q: And you said you do volunteer work.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="976">A: I volunteer in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="978">Q: Now, how did you happen to volunteer there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="980">A: What happened is that I had -- in the beginning when I first moved here I had a hard time to even go into the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, by the way, it took me like two or three years prior to -- that I went in.</sentence><sentence id="981">It took me three years just to get in the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="982">But when I moved here, I kept on meeting people and they were telling me -- and once I walked into the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, I realized that once I broke the <span class="DLF">barrier</span> and I was able to walk in there that I would like to volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="983">Because I was thinking prior to this to volunteer in other <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, like in the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span>.</sentence><sentence id="984">But when I got familiar with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, I decided to volunteer there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="990">Q: And why did you decide to volunteer there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="992">A: Well, I figured that just for the sake of enlightening, like people that come in or whatever, to make them understand certain things what they saw, something like that, something [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="993">Q: What did you want them to understand?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="994">A: Oh, they" ll un-understand, instead of just seeing pictures, or just seeing -- to give them a little more meaning to it if -- if -- if I had the chance that -- to understand.</sentence><sentence id="995">Cause sometime you look at pictures or you read something, it's one thing, but then sometime when another person sort of co-conveys a little explanation to you, maybe you got a little better insight of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="998">Q: Well, like what insight did you want them to have?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1000">A: Well, like understanding.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1002">Q: What did you want them to take away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1007">A: Well, I want them to take away more or less the -- how precarious freedom can be.</sentence><sentence id="1008">Basically, this is the way I see things, that if you don't know what dangers lie, you're not careful to protect what you have.</sentence><sentence id="1009">If you -- th-that freedom is something you don't take for granted.</sentence><sentence id="1010">That -- it's something that you have to you know, that you have to be aware of what's out there and not to allow yourself to be caught in it, basically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1015">Q: And what do you do at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1017">A: Well, this past two years, actually, I was taking young kids through the "Daniel's Story," okay.</sentence><sentence id="1018">N-Now this year I'm going to go and -- in fact they're going to have a training course for older kids, like in the <span class="BUILDING">permanent museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1019">So I'm gonna volunteer in there, I think, also.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1023">Q: And you take people through, you mean you explain --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1024">A: Yeah, it -- it -- it --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1025">Q: -- you actually explain --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: -- yeah, explain it, you know --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1027">Q: -- things as [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: -- like in the "Daniel's Story," it's for the younger children, that's four to seven graders.</sentence><sentence id="1029">So we take them through and we explain to them, we try to give them a certain understanding at their level.</sentence><sentence id="1030">And oddly enough, in some cases I think it does a lot of good, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1031">Q: So you -- you feel that they are receptive --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1032">A: Yes, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1033">Q: -- that they can understand --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1034">A: Right, right --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1035">Q: -- and they're interested.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1040">A: -- right.</sentence><sentence id="1041">And I -- and I've also seen, from different aspects -- in fact, my daughter is on the board of -- in the ADL and I've ga -- and they have programs that are also sometimes in conjunction with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1042">And they started a program, they train teachers, the Catholic diocese of the <span class="REGION">Washington area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1043">And I've seen what they did -- what they're doing in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span> is just phenomenal.</sentence><sentence id="1044">And I -- I feel that when you get it out there, if you got people that cooperate and they educate and they give them exposure that you get these kids that make -- grow up to be anti -- very big anti-Semites, that they get it from education of certain -- they get certain information that I may -- they will not get at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but they get it in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, like in the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> an -- at that, that each time you in -- you inject people like this with a little knowledge, that sooner or later it helps someplace else as they grow up.</sentence><sentence id="1045">You know what's - - even if they have a background of anti-Semitism, they already -- they got it in their own <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, through good teachers, which I've seen some of them are very, very capable.</sentence><sentence id="1046">So this is the kind of stuff, that's one of the reasons I feel that it's very important to reach them.</sentence><sentence id="1047">And a lot of the kids we get in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, many times you think of Jewish kids, actually we get kids from <span class="REGION">Carolinas</span>, from <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> and from that -- kids that never heard of Jews, or -- or never had any - - you know.</sentence><sentence id="1048">So this way it gives them, instead of thinking of a Jew as a Jew, they think of Jew as person that went through a bad experience.</sentence><sentence id="1049">And -- and maybe some of them will understand some of it.</sentence><sentence id="1050">So in that respect I think it's -- it's a very good thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1062">Q: When we met a week or so ago, I thought you had said that you worked in the <span class="BUILDING">speaker's bureau</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1064">A: Oh yeah, I forgot, okay, I do that too, right, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1066">Q: What do you do there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1072">A: Well, in there I -- I speak before groups, every so often, just about my experience, basically.</sentence><sentence id="1073">I-It's geared mostly to an individual's experience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: And how is that for you to do that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1078">A: Well, at this age it's okay, it's a -- each time it's a little difficult because it's very emotional.</sentence><sentence id="1079">But in the same time I feel that again, if people hear it, if somebody comes up with denials and they hear it from somebody like me that I went through it, all of a sudden th-they -- when a -- a denier denies, they may not buy it.</sentence><sentence id="1080">And then -- so in that respect I think it's -- as a matter of fact, just recently I spoke to the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> itself, and we had a full hou -- the whole <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> was full, actually standing room only.</sentence><sentence id="1081">And I could not believe the amount of people that came -- came up to me and they were just, you know, genuinely touched and -- and they were [phone ringing] Excuse me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1086">Q: Okay, we" ll turn it off. [</sentence><sentence id="1087">tape break] You were talking about speaking at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> recently and people coming up to you afterward.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1090">A: Oh yes, and it -- it was very, you know, I don't know, how can I put it?</sentence><sentence id="1091">I -- I was very surprised and -- because people came up and they actually [indecipherable] and asked for -- even for an autograph, you know, they were like very taken wi -- and the response was just fantastic.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1092">And you have to remember, most of these people -- not most -- if not all of them were -- like probably 90 percent of them were not Jewish, you know, and they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1093">So when you see it makes an impact like that it gives you an idea that it -- it's the thing to do, you know, to -- to make -- because th -- fa -- just for no other reason, just the fact that this way they could say gee, I met someone, so who is this guy denying that this happened when it did happen.</sentence><sentence id="1094">I met someone that did.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1099">Q: Really.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1100">A: So that respect I think it -- it serves a big purpose.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1102">Q: You've -- you've done a lot of being interviewed, not only the speaking that you do, but for the <span class="BUILDING">Wiesenthal Center</span>, for the Shoah Foundation and now today.</sentence><sentence id="1103">How is that for you?</sentence><sentence id="1104">What is that like for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1108">A: Well, a-at this stage 1-it's still -- every time I give an interview i-it's still difficult for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="1109">Certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> you just get very emotional.</sentence><sentence id="1110">But the only reason I did it is because everybody says it's important for -- for the history, so when I was in <span class="REGION">California</span> a few years ago, I -- you know, I did it because some -- for the same reason, and the same reason here.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And I just feel that if there's enough information out there that the deniers will have less chance of denying, basically.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1116">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="1117">Can we go back?</sentence><sentence id="1118">You mentioned that you had two children, but what was it like for you when your childr -- when your first child was born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1122">A: For me it was like probably the nicest thing that ever happened to me. ...</sentence><sentence id="1123">When my daughter was born, I -- it actually changed my life and gave me more purpose if anything, and it was just one of the nicest things probably in my whole entire life.</sentence><sentence id="1124">And -- and then of course my son came, so it, you know, iv -- it was just -- I enjoyed my kids from the time they were born.</sentence><sentence id="1125">| -- I could honestly say that.</sentence><sentence id="1126">I'm very fortunate in that regard.</sentence><sentence id="1127">As a matter of fact, yesterday was our anniversary, our 44" anniversary.</sentence><sentence id="1128">So my daughter made dinner and I can honestly say -- she is like 40 -- 42 years old, I think, and I had nothing but pleasure from her, so -- and now she has two children and it -- it's like I'm getting it all over again, so it's really very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1129">Now, my son got married and he -- he's also married a very nice woman and she is like -- like my</sentence><sentence id="1131">5 daughter.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And they have a -- a little boy now, Joshua.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And so in that regard I think that between my children, my grandchildren, it's probably the crowning of my life, if you will.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1148">Q: You mentioned that you moved to this <span class="REGION">area</span> about five years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1150">A: Yes, five years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1152">Q: And how did you decide to move to this <span class="REGION">area</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1154">A: Well, once I ga -- gave up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, it was a matter of -- of I could not live where I was, because I liked it there too, but it was a matter of moving into a <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen complex</span> or <span class="REGION">Florida</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And then I realized that I would rather live near my daughter so I could watch my grandchildren grow up.</sentence><sentence id="1156">So that was a easy decision, and it was a good decision because I really - - and I didn't want to go out and live in a <span class="BUILDING">senior citizen complex</span> because I really didn't want to go out to <span class="DLF">pasture</span>, I want to live among the living, that life goes on.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And so basically I got what I wanted, you -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="1158">So I -- I really made the right decision, as far as I'm concerned.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1219">A: He worked on Saturdays.</sentence><sentence id="1220">And my brother-in-law [indecipherable] was really very agnostic, he -- he just was not into religion.</sentence><sentence id="1221">He was very smart, very well read person, but he was not religious.</sentence><sentence id="1222">But he was also very well learned in religion that -- the funniest thing, cause it was -- he was -- he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yeshiva</span> and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1223">But he -- he was definitely not religious.</sentence><sentence id="1224">As a matter of fact he was -- and I have to admit, I sort of went along the same -- same route, because I worked Saturdays.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And religion to me wasn't something that I had a need for, and I still don't [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1226">So I'm -- I -- I -- now I go to <span class="BUILDING">services</span> and I do go because of my grandchildren and I want to belong, so I sort of -- but I'm not a very religious person, per se.</sentence><sentence id="1227">However I live, I think in life I practice most of the Jewish teachings or -- or live my life as -- as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1228">I never denied being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1229">I never went around with a thing on the lapel like some people to -- to</sentence><sentence id="1231">8 prove that I'm Jewish, I don't have to prove anything.</sentence><sentence id="1232">So I never had that -- but o-otherwise my thinking is also more on a nonsectarian level in some respects, like politically I -- I am liberal, I guess you would say, politically.</sentence><sentence id="1233">But I am conservative maybe in some <span class="REGION">areas</span>, you know, and I guess Jews may be, okay.</sentence><sentence id="1234">So I'm not exactly -- but some -- but religion really doesn't play, or never played a big part in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1235">In other words, I looked at religion more of a -- as a crutch woulds -- like someone -- I see some people do and I didn't want crutches.</sentence><sentence id="1236">So this is my way of explaining it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1255">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1259">Q: We do have to turn over the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1269">Q: This is tape two, side A, Martin Weiss.</sentence><sentence id="1270">I -- I want to ask you what you think about some contemporary things, like recently Joseph Lieberman was nominated to be vice president on the democratic ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1271">How -- how did you feel about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1275">A: Well, I -- I feel good about it, however, I have a little problem with it.</sentence><sentence id="1276">I -- I like the idea that he was chosen, and I respect him, definitely, because I think he's a capable guy, not because he's Jewish necessarily, but he has a certain -- he has a good character.</sentence><sentence id="1277">But I think they overplayed a little too much, they made a -- a lot to -- too much to do with -- the press in particular, about him being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1278">And I think sometimes the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> made a big thing to know about him being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1279">And I have a think on this that all things considered, that he's Jewish, we know this and a -- but he is -- more, he is running as a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, not as a Jew, so they shouldn't make such a big issue of him being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1280">In other words it shouldn't be -- like if this was in 1900 and they were making a big to-do about him being Jewish, it's one thing, but you're talking about 2000, where I think the citizens should be -- he's a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1281">So he -- is he running as a Jew, or is he running as a citizen?</sentence><sentence id="1282">And I think they're making too much of it, the fact that he is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1283">And I have to admit, I have mixed feelings because when Jimmy Carter ran, one thing I didn't like about him is because of his religion, because he was a born again.</sentence><sentence id="1284">And I thought that was -- like it clouded his thinking in terms of decision making, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1285">So I should apply the same thing to hi -- to Lieberman.</sentence><sentence id="1286">However, whether it's my own prejudice or what, I think Lieberman is more based -- how can I put it?</sentence><sentence id="1287">Grounded, if you will, and Jimmy Carter was more emotionally born again, but -- where Lieberman is more of a -- has a good character, plus he is jew -- he is Orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="1288">So maybe there is a difference in how I see it,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1291">0 okay?</sentence><sentence id="1292">But I don't like when they stress the Jewish part to the point where they already did.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1293">[inaudible]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1294">Q: There have been some portrayals of the Holocaust in movies recently, such as "Schindler's List," and there was one, "Life Can Be Beautiful."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1295">A: Yes, I saw both of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1297">Q: Yeah, what -- what do you think of like --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1298">A: Well, I -- I -- I really thought they were both very good. "</sentence><sentence id="1299">Schindler's List" of course, was in a different -- on a different level.</sentence><sentence id="1300">I think "Schindler's List" I think was fantastic, and it didn't color anything, it gave it a picture from the raw, like -- like it -- not that I was in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> or had the same experience, but it was -- i-it was rather -- rather well done in the sense to give the portrayal of -- of what's -- how things were at the time, or how a soldier behaved, or how -- you know, different things.</sentence><sentence id="1301">As far as the Schindler story itself, I'1l be honest with you, I never heard of it before the movie came about, I never heard of this.</sentence><sentence id="1302">So from my <span class="NPIP">vantage point</span> I never believed something like this could happen in -- in reality.</sentence><sentence id="1303">Evidently it did, so I -- you know, for me it was a -- you know, something almost hard to believe on the beginning, you know, until it was well documented, that there was a German that was -- that would do something like he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1310">But the movie itself, the portrayal and the circumstances of the inmates and th -- and -- versus the officer and the -- and the part and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1311">It -- it really gave it a -- a pretty good picture of a -- what life was like.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1314">Q: And what about the other <span class="NPIP">one</span>, is it life --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1315">A: Oh, "Life is Beautiful."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1316">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1322">A: That one I liked too.</sentence><sentence id="1323">At first I wasn't sure I'd like it because it was a comedy, how can you make a comedy out of it?</sentence><sentence id="1324">But all in all I thought it was really a very, very good movie.</sentence><sentence id="1325">Very, very good.</sentence><sentence id="1326">I -- I thought it was just very clever and in spite of they tried to make other movies something similar, I don't think they came even close.</sentence><sentence id="1327">This -- this one here I think was very unique for this type of movie.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1334">Q: Did you feel it was realistic, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1335">A: No, no, definitely was not realistic, but -- but it was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1336">Q: What -- what did you like about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1338">A: Well, it's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1339">Q: I didn't see the movie, I know what it's about, but I didn't see it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1340">A: | -- I saw it awhile ago, so I don't remember exactly.</sentence><sentence id="1341">But I liked about it because it -- it sort of conveyed a certain ca -- comedy -- a -- a sort of comical part of life, in a sense, from a satirical point of view, or something like this.</sentence><sentence id="1342">I think it has a certain satire that -- that was very illuminating as -- to some extent, sort of on a human nature, of a psyche, whatever, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1343">So in that respect I thought it was a very good movie, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1348">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1350">A: There was one movie [indecipherable] talking about movies that I saw recently that I really thought it was very good also.</sentence><sentence id="1351">Maybe not quite as [indecipherable] but that was "Sunshine", I don't know if you heard of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1354">Q: I did hear about it and it was highly recommended to me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1356">A: And it really was one of the movies that -- the reason I thought it was very good is because it dealt with the subject of assimilation, which I found very unique to Hungarian Jews, to a lot of --</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1361">Q: Unique to Hungarians?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1362">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1363">And a -- to Hungarian Jews because they tried very hard to assimilate and very har -- tried to be very like -- almost like a intelligentsia type persona.</sentence><sentence id="1364">You know, it -- it tried to take on that -- that Germanic mantle, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="1365">In -- in the -- <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> it's very similar in the -- in the class system and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1366">Which I was viol [indecipherable] always very violently opposed to, you know, from my point of view.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1368">Q: You were violently opposed to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1369">A: Opposed to that Hungarian Jewish mentality, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1371">Q: Oh, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1373">A: And one of the reasons that I thought it was good is because of the -- it deals with the subject of assimilation and a lot of Hungarian Jews were -- because of you did have a class system on <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and so everybody tried to make sure they act like they were very fancy, or very uppity.</sentence><sentence id="1374">And I remember even as a kid I used to find it very, very bothersome to me.</sentence><sentence id="1375">And when I saw Hungarian, a lot of Hungarian Jews, not all, a lot of Hungarian Jews, even during the war, a lot of the Hungarians were -- punished them because they were Jewish, and they were doing things to them that they were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1376">They would always [indecipherable] breast that they're royal Hungarians, okay, and I found that very, very disgusting to -- if you will.</sentence><sentence id="1377">If somebody beats me I'm not going to say I love you, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1378">And basically this deals with that type of subject, you know, it's -- it's a very -- you have to understand that, the -- like in the context, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1379">And I found it very amusing that somebody had enough sense to make a movie like that.</sentence><sentence id="1380">And that's about as closest to what I think, the way I understood things, that -- that -- you know, this shows it for what it is.</sentence><sentence id="1381">That if you are persecuted and somebody berates you because you're Jewish,</sentence><sentence id="1383">3 you don't join them and become one of them because he doesn't like you to be Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1384">Instead you tell him to go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, you know, where I come from, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1385">In fact during -- even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, I -- I recall, a lot of the Polish Jews -- like we always had markings where we came from.</sentence><sentence id="1386">Like I -- even though I was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> [indecipherable] we were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1387">We were not from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1388">So we had a mark that we came from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, a U for <span class="COUNTRY">Ungar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And the Polish Jews used to hate Hungarian Jews, okay, and one of the reasons was, believe it or not, for that reason.</sentence><sentence id="1390">And I was [indecipherable] when I lived among the Hungarian Jews and I moved -- and I went from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, I was -- lived on <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1391">But I had the same resentment to them, for that reason, because they always insisted what good Hungarians they were.</sentence><sentence id="1392">And me, as a Jew, I don't care where I am, if a -- a Ukrainian doesn't like me, I'm not going to say I love you, I'll hate him back.</sentence><sentence id="1393">So, you know, that's my take on it, for what it's worth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1417">Q: So you thought that was a good portrayal of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1418">A: Yes, it was very good portrayal, a really [indecipherable] very good.</sentence><sentence id="1419">It tells like of three generations, and could have had some different ways that I saw things, but nevertheless it -- it really hit the mark.</sentence><sentence id="1420">I thought it was very good.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1421">Q: Well, I don't have any more questions.</sentence><sentence id="1422">Do you have anything that you would like to say, or can you think of anything that I neglected to ask?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1425">A: No, I -- I did -- I think you covered it all.</sentence><sentence id="1426">I would just like to say that by and large most of us were lucky to come, make a life in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S</span>.. And things -- all things considered, things have changed in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="1427">I remember when I came there were a lot of things I didn't understand about -- there was Jim Crow and a lot of other things I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1428">I used to go to</sentence><sentence id="1430">4 night <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I used to ask, and I could never understand it.</sentence><sentence id="1431">But all things considered, that things have improved, and they're improving constantly with civil rights.</sentence><sentence id="1432">So I really think I'm fortunate that I'm here.</sentence><sentence id="1433">And I think probably most people that came from Europe the time I came would probably -- probably endorse that.</sentence><sentence id="1434">And that is going to be all that I have to say.</sentence><sentence id="1435">I think it's -- and life is good if you -- as long as you stay healthy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
