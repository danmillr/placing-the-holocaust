<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="207">Well, 19 -, let's see.</sentence><sentence id="208">When I got out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in 1936, David Selznick, who had been my father's assistant, had now set up his own <span class="BUILDING">studio</span>, and was planning independent films, one of which of course became Gone with the Wind, and the first A Star is Born -- which was the daddy of all those later Star is Borns.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="212">And, let's see, I came back and started working for David as a young screenwriter.</sentence><sentence id="213">And I had a seven-year contract -- it started at 50 and went to 75 a week.</sentence><sentence id="214">At the end of seven years, I would have been making $500.</sentence><sentence id="215">And, uh, but he, but even, a year and a half into it, I would write screenplays that David, I don't think ever read; he was so busy making the films he was already planning.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">And then they would call us in -- I thought of it as being a, sort of like being a pinch hitter who comes in off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">If there was some immediate problem, David would call Ring Lardner and me -- we were a writing team.</sentence><sentence id="218">We were both about 21, 22 years old.</sentence><sentence id="219">We were just out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="220">And he would call us in on --like on A Star is Born.</sentence><sentence id="221">They couldn't figure out the ending of A Star is Born, and we wrote the ending of it, that one where Janet comes out of Grauman's Chinese and sees her husband's footprints and handprints, and when she's asked her name.</sentence><sentence id="222">She's now a big movie star, and he's gone down, and in fact he committed suicide because he couldn't stand his failure while she's gone up.</sentence><sentence id="223">And she looks down, and when they ask her on the radio, she says, "This is Mrs. Norman Maine." --</sentence><sentence id="224">and it's a big ending in the movie.</sentence><sentence id="225">Things like that, little bits and pieces.</sentence><sentence id="226">It wasn't awfully satisfying.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="227">By the time he was about to pick up my third option, I went in to David and I asked David -- I'd known him so well for years and years -- my mother even put him, my mother really stage managed his wedding to Irene Mayer, my mother really sort of put them together, encouraged them.</sentence><sentence id="228">And I'd known him since I was a kid, and I said, "David, do me a big favor, please, don't pick up my option."</sentence><sentence id="229">And David was really very hurt.</sentence><sentence id="230">He said -- he felt really insulted, and he said, "Well, I have great plans for you.</sentence><sentence id="231">I was thinking that as I get older, I may retire, and you might be ready to take over for me, and then my young son Danny, Danny would work for you the way you work...." You could see this going on until the 21* century -- a dynasty of the Selznicks and the Schulbergs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="232">And I said, "Well, I appreciate that, David, I really want to be a writer, and not really a big producer, like you."</sentence><sentence id="233">And David said, he said, "Well," he said, " I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer" -- and that hurt my feelings a little bit, but that's exactly what he said -- he said, "I know we carry you on the payroll as a writer, but," he said, "I figure that sooner or later your producer's blood would begin to assert itself and that would kick in."</sentence><sentence id="234">I told Scott Fitzgerald that anecdote, and he used it in The Last Tycoon.</sentence><sentence id="235">It's in The Last Tycoon.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="236">So anyway, to cut this a little shorter, I finally did get out of there.</sentence><sentence id="237">I started writing short stories for Liberty and Colliers and for all the slick magazines.</sentence><sentence id="238">And I was doing very well with that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">And one of the short stories was What Makes Sammy Run?</sentence><sentence id="240">And I then decided that I'd like to put, work out there and try to develop that as a novel.</sentence><sentence id="241">And that, that caused me quite a bit of trouble.</sentence><sentence id="242">Because for one thing, I was, I was, I was a young member of the Communist Party (drinks) -- (PAUSE)</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: (Let's start that sentence again.)</sentence><sentence id="246">We met secretly every week, once a week, and we all had lots of assignments.</sentence><sentence id="247">We were very busy infiltrating different organizations, the Screenwriters" Guild and the Anti-Nazi League -- all kinds of things, the Democratic Party and Young Democrats, and we would try to infiltrate them, to influence them toward the communist program.</sentence><sentence id="248">So I asked at the meeting if I could be excused from my regular assignments in order to -- I'd like to stop and write this book.</sentence><sentence id="249">The answer was, "I guess you'll have to talk to Jack Lawson about that" -- Lawson was the head of the communist party -- "to decide whether the book would be valuable enough to the party to justify your dropping your assignments."</sentence><sentence id="250">So I went to see Lawson, and Lawson was, was very tough, really tough and hardnosed.</sentence><sentence id="251">And Jack said, "Well, Budd, I think the only way we can handle this is that you make an outline of the book, show me the outline, and then if I think the book will be useful to the party, then I'1l sort of supervise the writing of the book."</sentence><sentence id="252">And I said, "Jesus, Jack, I can't do that."</sentence><sentence id="253">And Jack started to give me things about the responsibility to the party.</sentence><sentence id="254">And that went on for many, many weeks, and I refused to do it.</sentence><sentence id="255">And they said, "No, you have to do it, or if you...." Finally, one day I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my young wife, Jigee, and I said, "Jigee, I can't take the argument any more.</sentence><sentence id="256">It's just eating me up, and so what I want to do is get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and drive away and just leave.</sentence><sentence id="257">And even that was, even that -- people don't realize how tightly disciplined the party was.</sentence><sentence id="258">You couldn't just get in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and drive away.</sentence><sentence id="259">If you were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> you had to tell them where you were going.</sentence><sentence id="260">And then if you were staying more than two or three weeks, you were reassigned to a unit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">It was very tightly controlled.</sentence><sentence id="262">So I just -- the very act of getting in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and driving away was a very serious defiance of the party discipline.</sentence><sentence id="263">And when I got back to, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dartmouth</span>, where I'd gone to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and found a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, very cheap, for about 50 or 60 bucks a month, it was.</sentence><sentence id="264">And for the next year I worked on this book, Sammy.</sentence><sentence id="265">Meanwhile, while I was there, the Soviet-Nazi pact came down, and that drove me even further from the party, because I felt that we all had to stand up to Hitler, and suddenly, suddenly the party people were saying that it's just an imperialist war between the Germans and the English.</sentence><sentence id="266">And we should be neutral and stuff, which I thought was a grave mistake, also.</sentence><sentence id="267">Also, and so I was even further alienated from the party.</sentence><sentence id="268">And I got the book done and, and went back and, uh, the top people like Lawson were mad, were very mad at me for going and doing this on my own.</sentence><sentence id="269">But when the book was published, the book reviewer for the People's World, which was the western edition of the Daily Worker, Charles Glenn was his name -- he wrote a rave review of the book.</sentence><sentence id="270">He thought the book was the Hollywood book, if not maybe the great American novel that everyone was talking about -- raved about it.</sentence><sentence id="271">That caused a firestorm apparently.</sentence><sentence id="272">They called him in and they gave him <span class="NPIP">hell</span> -- Lawson and company.</sentence><sentence id="273">Two weeks later he re-reviewed the book and he said, "On further consideration" -- and he even said, "It's been pointed out to me the shortcomings," and he absolutely trashed the book.</sentence><sentence id="274">Apparently they had threatened him that if he didn't, if he didn't do that he would be fired from the paper and maybe even kicked out of the party.</sentence><sentence id="275">He had to do it, and so he just trashed</sentence><sentence id="277">the book.</sentence><sentence id="278">It was a terrible book.</sentence><sentence id="279">It didn't do that and it didn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="280">It was really disgraceful, just disgraceful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: (Was there a direct connection between that experience and your later decision when faced with testifying?)</sentence><sentence id="323">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="324">The funny thing is, while the, while the communists were denouncing me, Sam Goldwyn fired me.</sentence><sentence id="325">He was just ina rage.</sentence><sentence id="326">When I came in, he screamed at me.</sentence><sentence id="327">It was almost like that Judge Freisler.</sentence><sentence id="328">And he screamed at me. "</sentence><sentence id="329">You're a traitor!</sentence><sentence id="330">You're a traitor!"</sentence><sentence id="331">Like that, he got purple, he was so mad. "</sentence><sentence id="332">How could you write that terrible book?!"</sentence><sentence id="333">he screamed at me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="346">And then, at the Motion Picture Producers Association meeting, that -- my father of course was a member and attended, and Louis B Mayer, his old partner, was now an enemy of my father.</sentence><sentence id="347">He took off the same way, and he said, "B.P. I blame you for this.</sentence><sentence id="348">You should have stopped him.</sentence><sentence id="349">It's your fault."</sentence><sentence id="350">He was yelling, too.</sentence><sentence id="351">You have no idea how outraged they were about this thing.</sentence><sentence id="352">My father said, "Louis, I did try to stop him.</sentence><sentence id="353">I wrote him a letter begging him not to publish the book."</sentence><sentence id="354">I still have that letter, by the way, that my father wrote me. "</sentence><sentence id="355">If you publish this book, it will ruin you.</sentence><sentence id="356">You'll never be able to live.</sentence><sentence id="357">You'll never get a job here again.</sentence><sentence id="358">And not only that, it will hurt me, it will hurt your mother -- who was just entering the <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> -- it will hurt the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="359">You've got to put -- don't publish the book."</sentence><sentence id="360">My father wrote that.</sentence><sentence id="361">Anyway, Louis Mayer said -- he said, "You know what I think we should do with him?"</sentence><sentence id="362">He said, "T think we should deport him."</sentence><sentence id="363">And he really meant it.</sentence><sentence id="364">It was really sort of fascinating, because I always said that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> in those days was like its own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">They thought of it as their own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">It was like <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="367">They ran that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">And they could do anything they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="369">The, the district attorney, Huron Fitz was his name.</sentence><sentence id="370">He was on a weekly salary.</sentence><sentence id="371">They paid him every week.</sentence><sentence id="372">And they could do anything.</sentence><sentence id="373">They could cover up any crime.</sentence><sentence id="374">It never got in the paper.</sentence><sentence id="375">Clark Gable drunkenly killed somebody.</sentence><sentence id="376">He did.</sentence><sentence id="377">And no one every heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="378">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="379">Because they ran everything, including the press.</sentence><sentence id="380">It was really their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">So when Mayer said that -- it really, it sounds ridiculous, but in his mind, I should be deported.</sentence><sentence id="382">And my father -- I always said my father was much more intelligent than Louis, he knew so much more, but he wasn't as smart in a practical way as Louis was.</sentence><sentence id="383">And my father said, "Louis," he said, "maybe you're right, but," he said, "where do you think his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Helena</span> should be?"</sentence><sentence id="384">He said, "Maybe we should deport him to Catalina Island."</sentence><sentence id="385">And according to my father, some of the producers laughed, but Louis didn't think that was a bit funny.</sentence><sentence id="386">So it was really an odd thing, I was being deported, really, and, and uh, blacklisted, by both the Hollywood moguls and the communist moguls, both.</sentence><sentence id="387">It was from both <span class="NPIP">extremes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">So I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and -- of course, by that time, I felt the die was cast.</sentence><sentence id="389">And then, from then on, which pretty much I've done, I would stay east and be a fiction writer and so forth, which I've tried to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1345">I was rather surprised, seeing the film did, The Nazi Plan, which had only a snippet of the trial, that I can't remember why that was chosen, because there were far more shocking scenes than that one that we showed, that was not as abusive as some.</sentence><sentence id="1346">I don't know why that one...For some reason, Donovan, at first he didn't want to use any of the film.</sentence><sentence id="1347">He thought that crimes against their own people would not be as germane.</sentence><sentence id="1348">| didn't really understand it, because after all we were using film of the anti-Jewish riots and so forth, which was against their own people.</sentence><sentence id="1349">I never really agreed with him.</sentence><sentence id="1350">I don't know what his reticence was about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1384">Q: (Filmed?)</sentence><sentence id="1385">Filmed, I mean, yes, filmed.</sentence><sentence id="1386">And the idea was that they would show that to every, in every <span class="BUILDING">diplomatic center</span>, show it to all the diplomats, Nazi diplomats and High Command people, as a way of frightening them against doing something like that again.</sentence><sentence id="1387">What we heard was that it, it sort of backfired.</sentence><sentence id="1388">It was so horrifying that they were afraid it would turn more people against the regime and they stopped circulating it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1471">So it was just a question really of, of very difficult selection and, and elimination.</sentence><sentence id="1472">I had told Jim Donovan that we could run, I thought we could, at one point I could see running all day from 9 to 5, and we could run all day.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1473">And he said, well obviously, we can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1474">And we finally worked it down.</sentence><sentence id="1475">Jim Donovan suggested four hours.</sentence><sentence id="1476">And so we went back and reviewed and tried to pick the high spots of the indictment that our film would relate to, but it, the... We had four film editors and they literally worked, I would say, twenty hours a day, I mean, they worked until two and three in the morning, and started again at 7, they just worked around the clock.</sentence><sentence id="1477">And that film unit had so damn much film --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1478">Q: (Tell us more about the editors and particularly I'm interested in Joe Zigman since he also worked on the other film.)</sentence><sentence id="1479">We had three very good Hollywood film editors: Robert Parrish [Drinks] and Joe Zigman, and Bob Webb.</sentence><sentence id="1480">And then we had one Russian girl -- I swear to God, I don't remember how she got assigned to us.</sentence><sentence id="1481">She was very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1482">She was a very small Russian newsreel editor.</sentence><sentence id="1483">I think her name was (Shostopol) or something.</sentence><sentence id="1484">And so the four of them would work around the clock, looking at this film and then trying to follow a sort of a rough outline that I would make.</sentence><sentence id="1485">Let's see now, we start in 1930 and we show highlights before Hitler comes in, and then, we sort of outlined it step by step, and then</sentence><sentence id="1487">2 somebody tried to select the most effective visually and verbally.</sentence><sentence id="1488">And thank God, of course we had interpreters with us to translate for us, as my, my three years of German at <span class="BUILDING">Dartmouth College</span> was being strained to the breaking point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1502">Q: (And were they handling original films, or did you make work copies?</sentence><sentence id="1503">How did they do that?)</sentence><sentence id="1504">Let's see, at first we just looked at the original film, and then as we started making our selections, we would, then we would make copies of the footage that they were selecting.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1505">Q: (And the bosses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> -- describe again how, how they wanted to review the film work.)</sentence><sentence id="1506">Well, for one thing, they would say something, that they needed a photograph or something.</sentence><sentence id="1507">The next day, they'd be calling and saying, "Well, where is it?</sentence><sentence id="1508">Bring it down."</sentence><sentence id="1509">We would try to explain, that first we have to select, we have to edit it, we have to -- they never understood it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1515">They never understood.</sentence><sentence id="1516">And General Donovan was very impatient.</sentence><sentence id="1517">He had no patience with us at all, none at all.</sentence><sentence id="1518">Because he would promise things on a high level that couldn't be fulfilled down where we were, and that was the trouble.</sentence><sentence id="1519">And he would be embarrassed, "Well, where is it?"</sentence><sentence id="1520">So that, uh....Donovan finally pulled, he himself pulled out of the trial, as you know.</sentence><sentence id="1521">His, his nose was out of joint because he was jealous of Justice Jackson, and he didn't want to play second fiddle to Jackson, really and so, eventually he withdrew completely, but that didn't stop us, but we were left in <span class="NPIP">place</span> without Donovan, to finish the work that we'd been asked to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1530">Q: (So when you were working that quickly, and you got a little more time because the trial was postponed --) Thank God.</sentence><sentence id="1531">When they said September 15"" -- we, we debated whether to go down and admit, I don't think that there couldn't be any photographic evidence.</sentence><sentence id="1532">You'll have to-- Even though Jackson in his opening day remarks mentioned that, I think, it was historic, it was the first time ever that there would be -- it was not only the first international trial, but the first trial I believe that ever used photographic, film photographic evidence that way.</sentence><sentence id="1533">And we were almost ready to say we can't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1534">And then word came, it's been postponed until October 15"*.</sentence><sentence id="1535">And then we had a month's leave.</sentence><sentence id="1536">But as we got toward October 15"" we weren't ready either.</sentence><sentence id="1537">We still had like a month's work, even killing ourselves with the work.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1546">And then thank God came this second postponement to November.</sentence><sentence id="1547">And that really saved us, because without that, there wouldn't have been any Nazi Plan film in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1550">Q: (And when it was shown, I'm imagining -- was it a film with tape joins, or had you made a print from, from the assembled material?)</sentence><sentence id="1551">Yes, we "d made a print of the condensed four hour version, yeah, yes, but as noted Ray Kellogg had to -- he testified as to the authenticity of the film, that it was all German film and so forth,</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1556">3 and so forth, and that all we'd done is brought four hours in place of four hundred hours, that we could have done.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1561">Q: (Did you ever consider whether you had too many Nazi Party rallies?)</sentence><sentence id="1562">I was worried about that.</sentence><sentence id="1563">I was worried about the party rallies, but at the same time, the party rallies included two valuable things.</sentence><sentence id="1564">One was what they actually said at those rallies, which as it moved on, became more and more inflammatory as they got more and more powerful, and as the western democracies surrendered to them, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1565">They became more and more aggressive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1571">So there was that sense of, of growing confidence in their aggression that you can't trace.</sentence><sentence id="1572">And also, there were people whose very presence indicted them.</sentence><sentence id="1573">People would say that we, like Speer was one, and Schacht was another -- and a number of people -- and Keitel and Jodl -- but people who said they were just German officials but not necessarily Nazi Party related.</sentence><sentence id="1574">And showing them with their Nazi badges and things was, was very helpful in indicting them.</sentence><sentence id="1575">And, and Riefenstahl was helpful in identifying various people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1665">Leni Riefenstahl.</sentence><sentence id="1666">Well, it seemed a fairly obvious search for us.[Sound problem -- Boom mike was missing. ]</sentence><sentence id="1667">Well, the -- of all the Nazi propaganda films that, many were made, by far the most, by far the most illustrious, or you might say notorious, of the Germans was Leni Riefenstahl's master film of the Nazi party day -- I think it was the seventh -- called the Triumph of the Will.</sentence><sentence id="1668">It was shot in a way that you could see obviously idolized and made heroes of the people, by shooting at a low angle up on Hitler and the other Nazi leaders, a sense of really ex-, ex-, exalting them.</sentence><sentence id="1669">The film, which was about a three-hour, very long documentary film, was a powerful, powerful piece of work.</sentence><sentence id="1670">It was overwhelming.</sentence><sentence id="1671">The, the idea that Goebbels had, and Hitler, was to have a film that could be shown, it was not only for German consumption.</sentence><sentence id="1672">It was shown all over Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1673">And I think that it definitely made a contribution to the capitulation of the western democracies, capitulating to Hitler, letting him make one act of aggression after another, in the <span class="REGION">Rhineland</span>, and the <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span>, and on and on they went, one little step at a time.</sentence><sentence id="1674">And the feeling was that, looking at that film, that it would make the non-German countries and their leaders say, "How can we possibly defeat that power?"</sentence><sentence id="1675">It was overwhelming, just overwhelming.</sentence><sentence id="1676">I think it was General Donovan who said that the Triumph of the Will was worth two Wehrmacht divisions.</sentence><sentence id="1677">It was a powerful piece of propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="1678">And so, it was, it didn't take any genius to think that we ought to talk to Leni Riefenstahl.</sentence><sentence id="1679">She not only made that one masterwork, but she made a number of small Parteitag films or reports.</sentence><sentence id="1680">She was very closely tied in with the whole Nazi propaganda machine.</sentence><sentence id="1681">And so it was obvious that we would want to, to speak with her and, and examine her, and bring her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1682">And so I went on a search one by one and first spoke to counter intelligence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and they directed to me to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.580032"

got closer and closer to finding out where she actually was living -- sort of hiding in the open, in a way.</sentence><sentence id="1685">It wasn't exactly hiding but she wasn't advertising either, what her address was.</sentence><sentence id="1686">And so I was able to actually, with a weapons carrier and an army driver, I was able to go to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and literally just knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1687">She was living in a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- it was a big, big, tustic -- it looked like three stories -- a very, quite large -- on a, overlooking a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bavarian lake</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1688">It was a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1689">So that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="1690">I just knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and somebody came to the <span

and</sentence><sentence id="1697">6 I waited.</sentence><sentence id="1698">It took a very long time for her to come.</sentence><sentence id="1699">I think it was almost half an hour, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1700">She took a very long time coming.</sentence><sentence id="1701">I think she was making up.</sentence><sentence id="1702">After all, she was a movie star as well as a filmmaker -- big star in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> --all these famous ice movies that she made, and mountain movies.</sentence><sentence id="1703">And she finally came, and I sat with her on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1704">And she started right away working on me.</sentence><sentence id="1705">She said, of course, "I'm a film artist, and

class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span>, and so forth, and I'm not a Nazi, I'm a pure film artist."</sentence><sentence id="1708">That was her own party line and, boy, she stuck to it pretty well, too.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And, and when she told me how well received she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span>, of course that was my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1710">She didn't know that I came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span>.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2185">Well, I just remember hearing about it once -- that they actually had finally found something that we had hoped to find.</sentence><sentence id="2186">We never really found anything that was related to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2187">We had hoped to.</sentence><sentence id="2188">And we'd been told there was such film, but we had never uncovered it, so I was fascinated by what Stuart did, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="2189">I wish we could have shown that at the trial.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2195">Q: (I'm sure you do.</sentence><sentence id="2196">Who told you that there was footage of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2197">Was this more from your SS editors?)</sentence><sentence id="2198">Yes, yes, they said that it, it also had been photographed, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2203">(Did you ever come across Walter Frentz, who had worked with Leni Riefenstahl as a cameraman on the Olympics film?)</sentence><sentence id="2204">I remember his name but I don't recall talking to him.</sentence><sentence id="2205">I remember his name, I guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2209">Q: (Because he filmed some of those things you put in The Nazi Plan, you know.)</sentence><sentence id="2210">No, I don't remember talking to him directly, only hearing about him.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2211">Q: (Is there anything you could tell us about the link between the fact that Stuart and Joe Zigman worked on both The Nazi Plan and the Nuremberg documentary?</sentence><sentence id="2212">Do you have any thoughts about that continuity between them?)</sentence><sentence id="2213">Well, only that, I think that Stuart, in getting ready to make that film with Pare, that a very logical, the most logical film editor would have been someone who worked on The Nazi Plan.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2217">And he was very friendly with Joe Zigman.</sentence><sentence id="2218">And, I think Bob Parrish had gone back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> and was building his own career right after he got out.</sentence><sentence id="2219">And so I think that Joe was the logical choice for, and an ideal choice for Stuart.</sentence><sentence id="2220">I remember him very well too, Zigman.</sentence><sentence id="2221">He was an awfully good person.</sentence><sentence id="2222">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2229">Q: (Pare Lorentz seems to remember him very fondly, too.)</sentence><sentence id="2230">Yes, he was awfully appealing.</sentence><sentence id="2231">When did Joe die?</sentence><sentence id="2232">Do you know when?</sentence><sentence id="2233">Cause I lost touch with him.</sentence></p></dialogue>

They were much more just advising as to what film was available.</sentence><sentence id="2247">I don't think that they, I don't remember them ever actually working on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Moviola</span>, editing the film.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2253">Q: (And Movieolas are what you used, right?)</sentence><sentence id="2254">That's what they used then, oh yes, God, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2255">Hours and hours and hours at the <span class="BUILDING">Moviola</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2256">Q: (Separate tracks for sound?)</sentence><sentence id="2257">Yes, I think there were separate <span class="DLF">tracks</span>, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2258">Q: (For your material for The Nazi Plan, if 1 understand correctly, you only used original tracks that were found with the films?)</sentence><sentence id="2259">Absolutely, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="2260">That's the only thing we could do.</sentence><sentence id="2261">We couldn't use anything that was not the German original, and nothing else, because they thought the defense attorneys would pounce on it.</sentence><sentence id="2262">And by the way, the defense attorneys took their jobs very seriously, because it was not like a routine, cut and dried.</sentence><sentence id="2263">They really, they were all excellent German lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And they worked very diligently and would make, I mean their, they argued very hard for their clients; they really did.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2265">Q: (Did you have a sense that there was anxiety on the part of the prosecution, as to whether the film evidence would be accepted and valid in supporting the indictment?)</sentence><sentence id="2266">Well, uh, only at the beginning -- at the beginning, much more than later.</sentence><sentence id="2267">I would say that gradually, they became impressed with how detailed the dovetailing of the film and the statements were to what they had on paper.</sentence><sentence id="2268">And so the, I think the confidence grew as, as we went along, and that when they found that statements and pictures really were incriminating, they felt that it would bolster their case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2273">I think it was quite surprising and very enterprising of Justice Jackson, coming from the background that he did -- after all, he wasn't John Ford from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> -- that he was as, as, as open to the use of film, which was so innovative and had never been done, as he was.</sentence><sentence id="2274">He was really very sympathetic to its use, as long as, as long as we were diligent.</sentence><sentence id="2275">Ben Kaplan who's this very nice guy that I still talk to on the <span class="DLF">Vineyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2276">He was very, very tough, and he was rather snooty about it.</sentence><sentence id="2277">I mean, he was doing it because they told him, but his heart wasn't really in it, I don't think.</sentence><sentence id="2278">But he would put it to very tough legal tests as to whether it was just movies or it really was, really was indictable evidence, which was good, really.</sentence><sentence id="2279">That was useful.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2284">Q: (1 believe that was the standard.</sentence><sentence id="2285">Visual images could be entered as long as they were pertinent, directly pertinent to the charge.)</sentence><sentence id="2286">Exactly, exactly, exactly.</sentence><sentence id="2287">And that's what he held us to.</sentence><sentence id="2288">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2294">Q: (Well, that must have made your job really hard at the beginning, when they hadn't decided yet what the indictments were going to be.)</sentence><sentence id="2295">That's very true.</sentence><sentence id="2296">At the beginning, the whole thing was so, so nebulous, that we almost had to try to read their minds as to what they would be looking for.</sentence><sentence id="2297">We had to decide -- these non-legal minds of ours -- what did seem to us indictable evidence.</sentence><sentence id="2298">Yeah, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="2299">We had pretty good -- but I must say, looking back, that we had a pretty good sense of what was really verbal and visual crime.</sentence><sentence id="2300">We had some sense of it.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2301">Q: (Do you know what was done with the original film elements when you were finished?)</sentence><sentence id="2302">Well, I was very nervous about that, because, for one thing, on the July 20", all that film, I had something which, there was some army colonel that was attached to us, and we found out that he had taken some of that film and sold it to some American company.</sentence><sentence id="2303">And I just hit the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>, because all this stuff was very valuable in a private profit-making way.</sentence><sentence id="2304">It was all very hot film, you might say.</sentence><sentence id="2305">I had nightmares about how people might try to grab it and steal it and, and, and sell it.</sentence><sentence id="2306">And this colonel in the army, I asked that, I talked to Kellogg about him and asked that he be removed from us.</sentence><sentence id="2307">| talked to people about -- you must not --everybody has to be absolutely, totally honest about this, and, and scrupulous about it.</sentence><sentence id="2308">We must send all of it back to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, and nowhere else.</sentence><sentence id="2309">And that's what I did.</sentence><sentence id="2310">I sent all of the film to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2311">Q: (So, you must have required security even for the <span class="INT_SPACE">cutting rooms</span>?)</sentence><sentence id="2312">Well, we did.</sentence><sentence id="2313">Yes we did.</sentence><sentence id="2314">Yes they did.</sentence><sentence id="2315">Yes, we were concerned about that, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2316">Q: (Did you every sleep during this period?)</sentence><sentence id="2317">Sleep?</sentence><sentence id="2318">I don't think any of us every slept very much.</sentence><sentence id="2319">I really don't.</sentence><sentence id="2320">We were very hopped up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2326">We were so excited, and also driven.</sentence><sentence id="2327">The phone calls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> were a nightmare.</sentence><sentence id="2328">When the phone rang from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, I would grit my teeth -- I knew what was coming.</sentence><sentence id="2329">And we were, we lived really in, in fear that any moment, they would say, "Pack it in, we'll do without the film."</sentence><sentence id="2330">We were very afraid that might happen, and so we all went on, on very little sleep, very little sleep.</sentence><sentence id="2331">But we were all very nerved up, too, and hyper, and really very into how much we were being challenged to do in a short time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2338">Q: (There must have been a great deal of comradeship.)</sentence><sentence id="2339">There was, it was a very close unit.</sentence><sentence id="2340">Bob Parrish who unfortunately passed away a couple of years ago, he became one of my best friends.</sentence><sentence id="2341">He was a wonderful man.</sentence><sentence id="2342">He was more or less in charge of all the film editors.</sentence><sentence id="2343">And he was a lovely man.</sentence><sentence id="2344">He was a sort of child star.</sentence><sentence id="2345">He was a</sentence></p></dialogue>

Well, 1.... Yeah, I felt awfully good last month, when I went for the 40", and, and uh saw these men who are now about 60 years old, who were really uh kids some were quite almost wild kids who were running the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and, uh, it was very, it was very moving for me to, when I, I call on the phone to University of California at Northridge, and, and, the voice I hear is this very deep, profound-sounding voice saying, this is Professor Scott, please leave a message, and I think of this Professor Scott as this w-wild kid of nineteen, he was, uh, he had been in the riots and throwing Molotov cocktails and all this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2394">When I went down there, I went down on the first day that the, that the curfew was lifted and it was pretty wild still there.</sentence><sentence id="2395">Some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were still smoking and smoldering, and there were little fires in the different open lots, and it was very, it was very, very tense, and I got this idea, sort of a wild idea, of starting a writer's workshop, and, and I put up a notice in a, it was kind of a <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westminster</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2396">I just put a sign up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulletin board</span> saying ""Writer's Workshop, anybody interested sign below."</sentence><sentence id="2397">And I said I would be back every Wednesday.</sentence><sentence id="2398">It took me a long time, for about 2 % months nobody came.</sentence><sentence id="2399">Nobody came.</sentence><sentence id="2400">I just sat there.</sentence><sentence id="2401">I just sat there, and I learned a lot about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Watts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2402">I read the local paper, The Sentinel, | talked with the social workers.</sentence><sentence id="2403">I went down in the, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">pool hall</span>, sat around there, got kind of snubbed and glared at.</sentence><sentence id="2404">I learned a lot, and my wife Geraldine was sort of taunting me about this, and she said, I'd come back and she said, "Well, what happened?"</sentence><sentence id="2405">I'd say, "Well nobody showed up."</sentence><sentence id="2408">6 And she'd say, "How long can you really, sort of a Don Quixote act, this is getting ridiculous, how many times can you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Watts</span> and nobody shows up?"</sentence><sentence id="2409">And I said "Well, I think I'Il just wait till, Pll give it from August until Thanksgiving."</sentence><sentence id="2410">This is now into, maybe early October.</sentence><sentence id="2411">And I said, "If nobody shows up by Thanksgiving ok, Pl, uh, I'll pack it in."</sentence><sentence id="2412">Finally, finally, the next time I went down, this one guy came.</sentence><sentence id="2413">And it was, it was Charles, uh, Taylor, and he came with a young somewhat, uh, somewhat demented, uh, young man, very disturbed.</sentence><sentence id="2414">And, uh, and this Charles sat opposite me and the young man sat right up, right next to me and just staring right at me.</sentence><sentence id="2415">It was a, uh, strange, just stared at me.</sentence><sentence id="2416">And, uh, anyway, I brought down Claude Brown's book, Manchild in the Promised Land and this guy Charles said, "What is all this?</sentence><sentence id="2417">What are you up to?</sentence><sentence id="2418">What are you trying to do?"</sentence><sentence id="2419">He was rather, a little bit belligerent, challenging, and I said, "There's no mystery to it, I'm trying to start a writer's workshop."</sentence><sentence id="2420">And I then read to him some excerpts from Manchild in a Troubled Land, and it was a little bit about, about Claude at the age of about 10, and, uh, there's been a riot in, in, uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harlem</span>, and he's too small to go to it but his big brother's saying, "Boy it was great.</sentence><sentence id="2421">We got a, we got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television set</span>, and a radio and this and that," and, um, little Claude says, he writes this, "Gee, that sounds like such fun.</sentence><sentence id="2422">When can we have another one, when can we have another riot?"</sentence><sentence id="2423">And when I read that out loud to him, his reaction was amazing, he said, "I didn't know you were allowed to write that in a book!"</sentence><sentence id="2424">He said, "Would they arrest him for that?"</sentence><sentence id="2425">And I said, "Not only not arrest him, this book is a major bestseller.</sentence><sentence id="2426">He's making a lot of money out of this book."</sentence><sentence id="2427">Well, he was just amazed.</sentence><sentence id="2428">And that was, that really opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, I think he went back, because next the day, next Wednesday, two or three people showed up with him, I think, including Johnny Scott and a few other young poets.</sentence><sentence id="2429">I'1l make this short, but what they showed me --TIcouldn't believe.</sentence><sentence id="2430">Their work was so goddamn good.</sentence><sentence id="2431">Johnny Scott was a goddamn genius.</sentence><sentence id="2432">I read some the other day, it's so good, and some of the others were too.</sentence><sentence id="2433">And that was the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2434">I then went to Los Angeles magazine and told them about this, and I showed them the work, and so they ran a piece with a page of their poetry and, uh, Time Magazine picked up on it, did a big story -- also running a page of Johnny Scott and Jimmy Sherman, Sammy Harris, all these young poets.</sentence><sentence id="2435">And for that to be in Time Magazine was a huge, huge thing.</sentence><sentence id="2436">And they were offered money.</sentence><sentence id="2437">Then it got bigger and bigger, and it's still going.</sentence><sentence id="2438">We have now, now we have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> I started it there, and we now have the Frederick
