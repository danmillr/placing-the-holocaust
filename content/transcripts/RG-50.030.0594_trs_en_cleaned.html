<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Substantial number of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, that's all I can tell you, I've no idea.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: Did your family have any housekeepers or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Yeah, we had a -- we had a -- we had a housekeeper.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Okay, any <span class="BUILDING">nannies</span>, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yes, [had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nanny</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">And a matter of fact, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I think we have a picture of myself dressed up as little boys were during that time period, with my nanny.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: Do you recall whether your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nanny</span> was Jewish or Gentile?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Do you remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Yes, when my -- my parents enrolled me in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, it was decided that's where I would go, and I lasted in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about maybe a day, maybe two days, three days, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="157">Very, very quickly, I was beaten during that time period and -- because the other boys asked me what I was, who I was, and th-the minute I said Jew, I was put to the test immediately.</sentence><sentence id="158">And my mother was called to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, she was told by the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that it would be best for my -- my protection to be taken out of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">So I-- my experience of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> may have been extinguished then after one day, or -- or two days at the most.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Do you recall what year this was, was this first grade --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Well, would have been -- it would have been 19 -- roughly about 1936, I would imagine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Because you just mentioned that they had asked you who they were and you replied you were a Jew, I know this might be hard to answer, but did you have a sense that this was something you could talk about?</sentence><sentence id="172">Did your parents warn you not to say that you were a Jew, or conversely did they say that that's fine?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: I think my parents tried to protect me by not saying much of anything.</sentence><sentence id="174">And I was never told what to say or what not to say.</sentence><sentence id="175">But I think I, from that experience, I learned rather quickly as to what I was, who I was.</sentence><sentence id="176">And I think my parents shielded me from all the discriminatory acts that had been ongoing in the mid-1930s.</sentence><sentence id="177">For example, I had an uncle of mine, a brother of my -- of my -- my mother, who was a very successful attorney in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">And of course he was -- you know, I found out later on why he wasn't working any more, because he was excluded from -- from that possibility.</sentence><sentence id="179">But generally I would say my parents really shielded me up to that time period.</sentence><sentence id="180">That's about the best way I can -- I can put it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: So you said you were taken out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> almost immediately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: And then what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: I was enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> with obviously, Jewish students, but not a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, okay?</sentence><sentence id="196">So, there were no -- there -- there was -- there were no re -- Jewish religious courses given.</sentence><sentence id="197">It was taking the regular curriculum within a</sentence><sentence id="199">framework of Jewish teachers and -- and just a framework of -- of Jews -- Jewish children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Do you recall some friends or friendships from that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Yes, Ido.</sentence><sentence id="209">We -- we get a--a bulletin from the municipality of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, where I recognized a young lady -- a young lady -- a-- a--a person's name, and I wrote to her, and she sent me back, she recognized my name immediately, and I don't know how, and sent me back a picture of our class, which was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="210">So yes, I -- I- I think that's the -- the only person that I -- that I have recog -- I have a memory thereof.</sentence><sentence id="211">When we -- when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, we had -- when we --I should sa -- correct this; when children were fortunate enough to leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, to go out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in some fashion or other, we would all have little autograph books and we would sign off on a little note to that st -- t-to that boy or girl.</sentence><sentence id="212">Maybe it was just putting our name and saying in German, best wishes for the future, maybe a little poem, maybe a little picture.</sentence><sentence id="213">But I do have a book like that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, with about -- the names of about maybe 15 to 20 different students, and -- and likewise a -- a number of teachers who -- whose classes I attended, wishing me well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Since you went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, I suppose most of your friends came from that circle.</sentence><sentence id="221">Do you recall having any Gentile friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: No, I don't -- do not, no.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: What are your first memories of Nazis or Nazism?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: I th--I think probably that experience in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was probably the -- the -- the first experience that I had at that point.</sentence><sentence id="231">My parents were no longer able to subdue their -- their thoughts as to trying to shield and protect me.</sentence><sentence id="232">And I do remember very clearly that either with my father or my mother, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> nearby, and the -- the merchant, the owner of that establishment, who knew my parents, looked at me with my blond hair at that time, and said, he doesn't look like a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="233">And that scared the hell out of me, because I knew what that meant.</sentence><sentence id="234">And then in 1938, obviously the -- my father and -- and I, every Sunday would go to a <span class="DLF">park</span> that was like two or three minutes away from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and we would sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and my father would schmooze, if that's the correct word, with neighbors who would come by.</sentence><sentence id="235">And my father delighted in showing me off as -- as his son, and -- and then one day we could no longer sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">park bench</span>, we had to sit on a-- on a yellow <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, which said, nur fiir Juden, for Jews only.</sentence><sentence id="236">And several times when we did that, we sat down, we were stoned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: That means people threw stones at you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Threw stones, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: How did your father react, what did he do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: My father always said to me, I always -- I told my father the last time that I went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with him that I was afraid for my life.</sentence><sentence id="255">And my father said to me that he had fought for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in World War I, and nothing would happen to me, that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had had waves of anti-Semitism previously, they come and they go, and because of our -- of our nature, of what my father has achieved, what he had done, he would protect me, and nothing would happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="256">Whether he actually believed that, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="257">It di-didn't -- after those words, while they were encouraging, I have to tell you that I honestly did not feel very much better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Do you remember a moment where you started feeling unease, or fear, or did it just build gradually?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: It built gradually, and I -- I think it gradually -- and the -- the -- the heightened moment of fear was about a week or two weeks prior to Kristallnacht, when as I said, we went to -- we, my father and I, went to services generally every Friday evening.</sentence><sentence id="265">And on this particular Friday evening, uniformed members of brown shirts, black shirts, call it whatever you want, uniformed Nazis, came into the <span class="DLF">front door</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and threatened -- threatened the congregation, threatened our rabbi, and our rabbi was magnificent in defending us verbally, and ultimately the Nazis retreated.</sentence><sentence id="266">And at that moment, as I said, when we walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I told my</sentence><sentence id="268">father I was afraid for my life.</sentence><sentence id="269">Then two weeks later, you know, we experienced Kristallnacht.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: I'm going to ask you about that in just a moment, but I'd like to get back to your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nanny</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">You mentioned that she was not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="279">Do you recall how long she stayed in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, and when she would have to leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: I--I think -- by the time I was six years old, I did not have one any more.</sentence><sentence id="284">So my -- my recollection of her are more -- more photographic than -- than anything that might have transpired between us.</sentence><sentence id="285">I will say this, that on Kristallnacht, my parents, by some fluke of miracles, were not with me.</sentence><sentence id="286">They were on vacation, and I learned later on that my father really, physically was not doing well.</sentence><sentence id="287">But they were not with us, and I was with my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="288">My grandmother had a non-Jewish worker -- servant in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I think -- I certainly can recall that -- that she told my grandmother that she needed to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because something -- something was going to happen that evening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: So what did your grandmother do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: Really nothing, except to -- she was a very, very tight -- tightfisted. [</sentence><sentence id="298">knocking]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: One moment. [</sentence><sentence id="300">break] You had said that you were with your grandmother on Kristallnacht --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="301">A: Right.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: -- and that one of the people who worked for her had warned her that she should leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: No, that -- that she was going to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="309">Q: She was going to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="311">A: She was not -- she was not going to stay all day, that -- that she had some ideas that something of an -- she wouldn't say what, and maybe she didn't even know, but she felt that she should not stay there all day, and left.</sentence><sentence id="312">And my grandmother was a very primped, starched lady, never smiled.</sentence><sentence id="313">You know, it's one of those grandmothers that -- you know.</sentence><sentence id="314">And I experienced Kristallnacht in her <span class="BUILDING">hou</span> -- in -- in her <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">And unfortunately, her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that she lived in overlooked the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, over -- was -- e-even though our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a block or two -- I think one block away, I think we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> where we could look and see the top of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I could see the -- you know, I could see the fires bursting through the -- through the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: So, can you describe basically that day, and/or that night to me?</sentence><sentence id="324">What happened in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that you were, and what were you seeing <span class="NPIP">outside</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
