<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5386">A: That's fine.</sentence><sentence id="5387">And then he asked how many were they.</sentence><sentence id="5388">So this young kid apparently told

you do that?</sentence><sentence id="5423">He says, well, I saw them over there, and they were trying to hide, and there I was, so I point to them</sentence><sentence id="5425">26 [indecipherable] and they surrendered.</sentence><sentence id="5426">So we got close to them -- because they wanted to surrender, they didn't want to fight with the Germans any more.</sentence><sentence id="5427">So when we got close, then lined up and my lieutenant -- there's a difference between lieutenant and the captain, they always interchange you know, whoever was in charge at the time.</sentence><sentence id="5428">So my lieutenant tries to speak to them, he doesn't speak Russian, and I don't speak Russian either.</sentence><sentence id="5429">And then this Russian soldier goes, heil
