was sort of a family reunion.</sentence><sentence id="272">He and his wife and their son Jeff who was my second cousin came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienbad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">And they made the decision that the following year I was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kansas City</span> for one year and my cousin Jeff was to come and stay with my mother for a year.</sentence><sentence id="274">Sort of be a family exchange.</sentence><sentence id="275">It developed during that following year he wasn't going to come but I was going to go for good.</sentence><sentence id="276">And I had an affidavit and I had a visa.</sentence><sentence id="277">My mother did not yet.</sentence><sentence id="278">She had, she had an affidavit from her cousin but she didn't have a visa yet.</sentence><sentence id="279">It hadn't come up yet.</sentence><sentence id="280">So I went by myself in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="281">She took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and put me onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Manhattan ship</span> and I went off as a 14 year old to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: That so I really I should say something else about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">I am sure that if my father had lived we would have all succumbed in the Holocaust because he felt he wasn't German.</sentence><sentence id="332">He had served in World War I. He had an Iron Cross, actually an Iron Cross that was bestowed belatedly by Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="333">So he was, this was never going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="334">We would have never left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and we would have all succumbed if he had not passed away.</sentence><sentence id="335">So this is one of the, my personal history that I feel that the only way that we really survived is because he had passed away at an early age.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: Let's now talk about you as a child in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">Did you experience any anti-Semitism?</sentence></p></dialogue>

time, she thought anything is better than a change.</sentence><sentence id="2060">So let's stay for a third year.</sentence><sentence id="2061">And we were the first family to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> for three years, which of course is standard now.</sentence><sentence id="2062">It became standard and so we stayed there for a third year.</sentence><sentence
