<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: It is May 6, 1996.</sentence><sentence id="2">This is an interview with Gisela Feldman, a survivor of the SS St.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3">Louis.</sentence><sentence id="4">Now first what I would like to ask you is if you would state your name, your date of birth, and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Yes, well.</sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Gisela Feldman and my maiden name was Klapl, K-L-A-P-L, and I was born on the 18th of September, 1923, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> at that time and about your schooling and your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born in 1923, as I said, and so I had 10 years without Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="12">My parents originally came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the Austrian-Hungarian empire of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, at the age of 15, so by the time I was born, they had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about twenty years.</sentence><sentence id="13">During the first 10 years, what I can remember is people still had housing shortages and that was a result of the first world war, and it was very difficult to get a decent <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">But that affected everybody, it wasn't something that we felt we were singled out for that.</sentence><sentence id="15">But when it got to some of 1932, I was nine then, I became aware of the fact, there was some sort of tension between the Nazi Party and the Communists.</sentence><sentence id="16">I remember marches in the <span class="DLF">street</span> where people beat each other up.</sentence><sentence id="17">And in the block of <span class="BUILDING">flats</span> where I lived, a person was even shot because they were demonstrating against the Nazi Party.</sentence><sentence id="18">So that in a nine year old, aroused some sort of fear that something was about to happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: What was it like at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="28">Did you feel very well acclimated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: Yes I did.</sentence><sentence id="32">In fact my sister and I were the only Jewish children in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">And during the sort of beginnings of the Nazi party I had a very good teacher and he kept telling all the children that I was no different from anybody else and they had to treat me very well and all that.</sentence><sentence id="34">But that didn't</sentence><sentence id="36">go on for too long because when I reached the age of 11 and I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span>, I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> because it was very difficult to stay on in a <span class="BUILDING">state school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="44">Q: You had many friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: Yes, I had a, I used to play with the children in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I didn't feel too discriminated against playing with the other children in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, but I was always blonde and blue-eyed and so I suppose that made a difference too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Was your family particularly religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: Well, not a terribly orthodox, but I as a child, I wouldn't ride on a sharbot(ph) and I wouldn't switch the light on.</sentence><sentence id="51">However my father kept his <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> open after going to a service in the morning, he came back because we lived in such a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Christian neighborhood</span> that, you know, we had to keep the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> open on a Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="52">And our customers really didn't stay away from us until an SS man stood guard <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and told people not to buy from Jews.</sentence><sentence id="53">And even then, some of them were very brave they came in and we had one particular customer across the <span class="DLF">road</span> from us, a Catholic baker, and they also weren't very fond of the Nazis, and you know bakers have to get up very early to bake their bread, and they found somebody dobbing(ph) their <span class="DLF">shop windows</span>, friends of the Jews, and so they just poured buckets of water from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> over them.</sentence><sentence id="54">So that was really a very brave act in the climate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Do you have a sense of how your parents felt at this time and what did your father do?</sentence><sentence id="61">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> was it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: We had a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">Well, once or twice my father was beaten up in the dark when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">And then things got a little difficult.</sentence><sentence id="67">But you see, when you're sort of 12, 13, you don't quite realize the dangers that were going on.</sentence><sentence id="68">But we did know of people whose fathers disappeared or they used to go and sleep in other people's <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, so when the party came to pick</sentence><sentence id="70">them up they wouldn't be at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they couldn't be found.</sentence><sentence id="71">So yes, things were getting very sort of disturbing.</sentence><sentence id="72">But you know, people always say to me, "Why did people not leave early on?,"</sentence><sentence id="73">and the only theory I can have is, if you are very poor you can go because you've got nothing to lose, and if you were rich, you know at the beginning you were allowed to take your money out with you, but if you are a middle-class person then you sort of value a little bit of security.</sentence><sentence id="74">So that's the only explanation I have because we didn't leave until 39 which was the last moment almost.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="87">Q: So they didn't talk to you much about what they were thinking or about possibly immigrating sooner?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="89">A: No, my parents really I think protected us quite a lot.</sentence><sentence id="90">They didn't show their fears a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="91">And our final moment really came when my father was deported in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="92">I don't know whether you know that.</sentence><sentence id="93">My father had a Polish passport and at that time the Poles said that anybody who hadn't returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for a number of years was going to lose their passports, and I think the Nazis got a little bit worried that they were going to be left with all these people with Polish nationality and they picked up all the men during the night and just deported them to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">And I think that's when things started really to, for us, to reach a high point where we had to decide to do something, although we had to shut our <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> before that so when my father was deported he didn't have any income anymore.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Tell me, just going back just a little bit, when they closed the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, when was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: That was sort of the beginning of 38.</sentence><sentence id="104">And they also made me leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was then decided education wasn't going to be much use to you if you had to go into a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you didn't speak the language.</sentence><sentence id="105">So people got their children to learn a trade.</sentence><sentence id="106">I went to dress-making school, people became plumbers, and and so on because you felt if you had a trade in your hands you didn't need to know the language.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: And what was your mother.</sentence><sentence id="118">Was your mother a full-time housekeeper?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: No, she worked with my father in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">And we had a maid.</sentence><sentence id="123">Which of course I don't remember which year 34, 35, you weren't allowed to have anyone anymore unless they were over 50.</sentence><sentence id="124">Because you know there was this word rusenshen(ph), I don't know if you've come across it.</sentence><sentence id="125">But that's why you're not allowed to have anybody under 50.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: Tell me a little bit about when your father was deported and how that came about and how you first found out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Well, that was obviously something, a very well kept secret because in October, the 28th of October I think, during the night there is a ring at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and two men came in civilian clothes actually, and they said to my father , "Pack your bag, get your passport" .</sentence><sentence id="134">And you know that was a very frightening experience and my sister panicked, she's three years younger than I, and she started shouting at them and they said , "Well if you don't keep quiet we will take you away as well."</sentence><sentence id="135">I must have kept calm because I remember I got up and made sandwiches for my father for him to take the sandwiches.</sentence><sentence id="136">But we didn't know why or what or where they were going to go, they didn't tell us, and while they were watching my father I rushed out down the <span class="DLF">street</span> to go to a phone and phone my uncles to warn them, but a strange man answered the phone so we knew they had also got them.</sentence><sentence id="137">And, then some sort of rumor came about that they had been taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span>, and then all the women rushed to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to see if they could still see their husbands or fathers, but we didn't see our father, but eventually we heard from him that he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">And they had apparently there was some sort of tug-of-war between the Germans and the Poles because the Poles didn't want to take them, the Germans wouldn't let them back, and there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp where</span> they held all these people which was called bonchin(ph) and but my father still had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> so he and his two brothers went to the family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: So after he arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you were able to correspond with him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: We were going to speak to with him on the phone, we were able to speak to him on the phone.</sentence><sentence id="154">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="155">Well it wasn't war time yet, you see, it was 38, it was just before Crystal Night actually that they were deported.</sentence><sentence id="156">The 28th of October, Crystal Night was in November so it wasn't very far apart.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: So tell me a little bit about Crystal Night and that evening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Well, I really got up, we got up the next morning, and you see not living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish area</span> we weren't so aware as to what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="164">Our <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> had gone so really there wasn't much Jewish property for them to destroy.</sentence><sentence id="165">But when we heard about it I walked to my Aunt's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and yes, you were walking through glass.</sentence><sentence id="166">You know once you neared <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and so on then you could see what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="167">That's why it's called Crystal Night, isn't it?</sentence><sentence id="168">We were walking on glass.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="175">Q: In between the time that your father was deported and the time that you were attempting to leave did things get progressively worse?</sentence><sentence id="176">What was it like for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: First of all we were asked to leave our <span class="BUILDING">flat</span>, for a German couple, and strangely enough my mother went to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and the judge gave her three months, which was quite unheard of, you know, that he should allow us to stay, and so he gave us three months, and we moved in with my aunt after that whose husband had also been deported.</sentence><sentence id="180">And then my mother started seriously to look around for some <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to go.</sentence><sentence id="181">Because we had no income.</sentence><sentence id="182">There was no safety anymore.</sentence><sentence id="183">We children couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">So obviously, rather late, but we knew then that we had to leave, because you see even the lot of the German people I think didn't believe that our friends anyway that he could stay in power.</sentence><sentence id="185">And a lot of the Jewish people who had become so much part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and the professional people who held jobs in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and everywhere, nobody could</sentence><sentence id="187">believe that an intelligent nation could allow in a dictator which in a way wasn't imposed on them, because Hindenburg supported him and he really got in by legal means but nobody thought that such a tyranny could go on but they are, that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="188">And so then my mother started looking around and by that time it was very difficult to get a visa to go to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and so people took any visa they could get.</sentence><sentence id="189">I know friends of ours went to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and eventually these Cuban visas came up and you had to pay for them with them with foreign currency, which really meant you had to smuggle money out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in order to have dollars to pay for these visas, which my mother did, she smuggled money out, and she didn't even know who it was going to, it was some sort of code name, you know she talked to somebody about uncle so and so, I remember that as a child.</sentence><sentence id="190">And then eventually we bought visas with the foreign currency, and which was supposed to be perfectly legal.</sentence><sentence id="191">And then my mother had to arrange a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to take us across and she got four passages on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> called the St. Louis which was meant to sail from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> on May the 13th, which it did.</sentence><sentence id="192">And the Germans allowed people to come back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> providing they were leaving again.</sentence><sentence id="193">It was a sort of transit visa they allowed them.</sentence><sentence id="194">My father applied to come back and the Poles sent the wrong brother back, so my father didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="195">And so my father phoned up in tears and he told my mother not to go without him, and she must have been a very determined woman because she said "I have to take the children out."</sentence><sentence id="196">In any case, there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> leaving after ours, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Orinoco</span> and she couldn't get four <span class="DLF">passages</span> on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, but one she could get, so she was determined to take up three of the <span class="DLF">passages</span> and my father was going to join us afterwards on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: You had how many siblings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="218">A: [had a sister, I have a sister still, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: So at the time you had your mother, you and your sister, the three of you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Three of us were going yes.</sentence><sentence id="226">And actually the finalization of the visas didn't happen until the last minute.</sentence><sentence id="227">We were to leave on a Saturday and Friday morning we still hadn't heard that everything was finalized, so my mother rushed off to sort things out, then she called me on the phone and I went with her, and then on the Friday afternoon we got everything finalized, and we phoned my 12 year-old sister and she did all the packing and we left on the Friday night.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Do you know much more about how she obtained...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: The visa?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: No, I'm afraid I don't.</sentence><sentence id="238">I just know that she had to pay with it for it with foreign currency and I think they were bought abroad, paid for abroad in the <span class="BUILDING">Cuban embassy</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: So your father never made it out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Never made it out, no?</sentence><sentence id="244">You know, if you know the story of the St. Louis, when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span>, they wouldn't allow us to land, and the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was leaving two weeks later, and when the captain heard that we couldn't land I think they got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>, they turned back but they didn't tell the passengers they were turning back, and they ended up back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then my father had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we never saw him again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: So he did manage the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: He managed the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> but he went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then eventually to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: So tell me a little bit about the passage, initially you were on the SS.</sentence><sentence id="252"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Yes, well we left on May the 13th, and if you manage to get a hold of the documentary, you will see how efficient the Germans are because they found all the old footage of us getting on, and they even found me as a 15 year old amongst all that crowd getting onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">But we left on May the 13th and for us youngsters it was really quite an adventure, because this was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury liner</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="258">the captain was a wonderful man.</sentence><sentence id="259">He instructed the crew that we had to be treated like anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="260">We had to pay for the return journey, but nobody really saw anything into that because we all felt the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was going to come back empty and it was only fair that they were paid for this.</sentence><sentence id="261">And it was an experience to be on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liner</span> where you had a <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> and a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span>, and all the usual games you have on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">Obviously very few of us had ever been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cruise</span> so it was exciting for us youngsters.</sentence><sentence id="263">But my mother never took part in anything.</sentence><sentence id="264">She didn't worry us, you know.</sentence><sentence id="265">And it must have been an awful thing to leave your <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you've lived, and leave a husband behind who didn't want you to go.</sentence><sentence id="266">My mother had ten marks, which I don't know how much it would have been then, perhaps twenty dollars or something for the three of us, that is all we were allowed to take out.</sentence><sentence id="267">So she must have been terribly worried about the future, you know two children, twenty dollars, no job, nothing to go back to.</sentence><sentence id="268">And so, but she never worried us at all.</sentence><sentence id="269">And during the first 10 days we really had a very good time until we landed and found that things began to go wrong.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: What was the feeling within the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> with you as a teenager could get a sense of anywhere along the <span class="DLF">line</span> between the...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: The main thing is, we saw so many people with shaven heads.</sentence><sentence id="289">And it appears then, we sort of found out they were people let out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, they had to sign papers to say they would never return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they were let out, and these people seemed to take longer to take part in the festivities that were going on, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="290">We had our Friday night services, we had a portrait of Hitler in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span>, but the captain allowed us take it off during the services and then it had to be put back after the service.</sentence><sentence id="291">It's very difficult for me now to say what I remember as a teenager and what I've read since, of course, it's very difficult to separate these things.</sentence><sentence id="292">Because there was also a book written about it, called "The Voyage of the Damned," but unfortunately I feel</sentence><sentence id="294">it's a little bit of a soap opera and they made a film of that too.</sentence><sentence id="295">And so I don't know if I know it from the book I read or whether I really knew it that there were people watching us.</sentence><sentence id="296">The only thing I know is my mother had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> on her own and one night she woke up and found somebody searching through things and walking around the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">And after that she never slept alone again.</sentence><sentence id="298">So I don't know how much truth there was in it all, that we were being watched.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Did you know before you hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> at all that the visas, the transit passes was canceled?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Not really, except somebody said on the way there that there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> coming from somewhere else, and I can't remember where from, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or somewhere else, and they said, "We really should hurry and get there before the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> so that we don't have to hang about too long."</sentence><sentence id="315">Now I don't know if there is any significance in that or not, but for certain we didn't know anything until we got there, and we were even told to get up very early the next morning and had our breakfast and we were lined up with all our suitcases ready to get off, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> stopped quite a way outside the <span class="DLF">harbor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">Well, once again we thought that was quite normal, you know, it is always deep enough for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go right into the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and we had stopped <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and the Cuban police came on and the immigration people, and then suddenly the atmosphere changed and we were told, "not today, not today, meyeniana(ph) tomorrow, tomorrow," but tomorrow never came, and then people were getting anxious but nobody ever gave up hope.</sentence><sentence id="317">You know we were so near <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we never thought anybody would allow us to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">I mean nine hundred and odd people that's really nothing is it , a drop in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: There were some people who left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Yes, but they were I think Spaniards and Cubans or something, and one family I remember leaving, left because I think somebody paid them a lot of money for them, but I think they were just family if I remember correctly.</sentence><sentence id="327">But the others I think were people that had that weren't refugees</sentence><sentence id="329">0 that had come to holiday or to play in a band or something but I really don't remember these things.</sentence><sentence id="330">And one man of course committed suicide and he was left behind.</sentence><sentence id="331">And that I remember very well because I was standing by the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and I saw him rushing out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> with the blood dripping down and he ran to the edge and jumped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">And one of the sailors actually jumped after him and rescued him.</sentence><sentence id="333">But even when he was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rescue launch</span>, he was still trying to pull his arteries out and he didn't want to be saved.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: He had cut himself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: Yes, with a razor blade.</sentence><sentence id="345">Because he'd been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and decided he wouldn't go back, and I suppose people's condition wasn't good you know when they got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, their minds must have been very confused anyway, and then to be faced with the problems that we might have had to face, he couldn't put up with.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: So what happened, you're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> for a few days?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: Several days, yes.</sentence><sentence id="351">And then they decided, the Cuban authorities decided, that no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> could stay in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> for such a length of time and that we should leave the, I think it's a three mile zone or whatever it is, and just go back and cruise around until more arrangements were made.</sentence><sentence id="352">And I believe the American Joint(ph) worked very hard for us, and they wanted to pay money for us, but I think it was more a political issue because I think whatever they offered it was decided not to accept the money and not to accept us.</sentence><sentence id="353">Whatever reason they could give for us, I really don't know, I really only know what I have heard since, so I don't know what the political issue was that why they wouldn't have us.</sentence><sentence id="354">And then we just went off and cruised along the coast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gun boats</span> came out in case somebody jumped overboard and swam ashore you know, and so.</sentence><sentence id="355">And eventually when we turned back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, we still really didn't know what was happening because we didn't know which direction we were going in, so for quite a time we were in</sentence><sentence id="357">1 a way left in the dark except they had a committee which apparently knew what was going on but certainly we teenagers didn't know what was going on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: Do you think your mother was involved in...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: She wasn't involved in the committee, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Did she know much more than you did about what was going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Well, she never showed anything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="373">I just know that she never took part in any of the journification so obviously she was worried all along, so I really don't know if she knew any more than we did, but probably she suspected more than we did.</sentence><sentence id="374">Probably had a greater fear than we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="378">Q: Now what was life, what did you do just on a daily basis on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> as all of this was happening as a teenager, as a child?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: You mean after we couldn't land, because before that we had a jolly good time, we swam and played games and went to dances and film shows.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: After <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havana</span> and then you..?.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: Well, then really very few people attended the sort of film shows, and the dances, and all that, because there was a sort of cloud hanging over us, even though you had hope that you weren't going to, that you were going to land somewhere eventually, but obviously it was a worrying time because you didn't know what your future held for you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Did you make new friends while you were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: Yes, I made quite a lot of friends but really we didn't keep it up because a small, a quarter of the people ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and a lot of those eventually got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> anyway because so many of them had quota numbers to get into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at a future date, and so quite a few left during the war even, and | think we were sort of spread around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and I in particular was sent away, straightaway two days after we arrived I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">seaside</span> to scrub</sentence><sentence id="390">2 <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> for them you know, because the only work you were allowed to do was domestic work, so I was sent away straightaway.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: So this is after, obviously you returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="398">Q: So you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="400">A: Oh no, no, we ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, sorry.</sentence><sentence id="401">Yes, well eventually when we had to go back towards and we knew we were going back towards <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, as far as I know several other people tried to commit suicide, and we had a group of young people checking all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> to watch people, and it was a very grim atmosphere then of course.</sentence><sentence id="402">And when we were off the coast of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> suddenly we heard that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were prepared to take a quarter each of the people.</sentence><sentence id="403">And obviously a lot of people wanted to go <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, because the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were to near <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">And my father obviously knew what was going on because he sent us a telegram and said "Choose <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>."</sentence><sentence id="405">But really one didn't have a choice.</sentence><sentence id="406">They decided where people should go and people's different nationalities they had different quotas how many people they would take in of each nationality and my mother told me to go and speak to the Immigration, English Immigration Officer because I had learned English at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="407">How good my English was I really don't know, but I did talk to the man and whether that had any influence or not I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="408">But luckily we ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> first landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and the people that were staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> obviously got off and the others were transferred by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and we were put on a sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo ship</span> and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">And we've heard since that at the time Gobels(ph) published in the newspapers you see nobody wants samiva(ph) at least we are building <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="429">Q: And you all three stayed together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="431">A: Well, not quite.</sentence><sentence id="432">We stayed together for the first few days, because the Jewish Committee, it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, it was <span class="BUILDING">Woben(ph) House</span>, gave people, put people into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for the first week, but I after three days we were sent away immediately.</sentence><sentence id="433">My sister was 13 and she went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: It was <span class="NPIP">seaside place</span> called Broadstairs(ph).</sentence><sentence id="440">It was a <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> actually for Jewish refugees.</sentence><sentence id="441">And, but, the matron of the <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> was not Jewish, and there were three of us actually and we were always hungry.</sentence><sentence id="442">The didn't feed us very well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="447">Q: So this was the middle of, this is the end of June, the beginning of July?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="449">A: Yes, in fact we came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the 19th of June I think, because my sister's birthday is on the 18th and we still had that on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="450">Yes, that was towards the end of June then, yes, yes, and I stayed there until September and then I met a family on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> and they asked me if I would come and look after their children for them, of 6 and 11, and I was getting in English money, 25 p(ph) a week and they were offering me a pound a week or something, and so I obviously accepted, ended with going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> so I accepted that job and the children were as I said six and a half and 11, and I was 15, and they asked me to do the cooking and the cleaning, and if the children couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they asked me to write the letters to teachers, so somebody must have had great fun reading my writing, but still.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="453">Q: And what about your mother and your sister, what were they doing at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="455">A: My mother eventually found work with some...[end of side one].</sentence><sentence id="456">So, at what point do you want me to start?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="460">Q: Oh.</sentence><sentence id="461">I kind of like, eventually we can get back to what we were just talking about, but you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and you were working for a family.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="462">A: Yes, I was working for a family then and then of course the war broke out, and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and we, at one stage, went and slept in the <span class="BUILDING">underground stations</span> to protect ourselves because of the bombing.</sentence><sentence id="463">But I stayed with that family for about six months and once war broke out, we were allowed to do war work, and so then my sister had been evacuated by then, but my mother and I found <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and we lived together and I went to work making soldiers uniforms and gunpowder bags, and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: What was the name of the family that you stayed with in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="482">Q: And how did that come about, if you don't mind me asking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: How did that come about?</sentence><sentence id="485">I went to a Czech garden party with a man actually who has since became an actor, his name was Herbert Long, but he wasn't an actor in the days I knew him, he played in the Pink Panther films, but you won't remember that you are too young.</sentence><sentence id="486">But, and my husband asked me to, well, this man asked me to dance, and then saw me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> afterwards and told me that if I was still going out with him two months later I would marry him and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="487">And my husband was 21 and I was 19 and a half but he had no family.</sentence><sentence id="488">He came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he was alone so possibly that's the reason he was in such a hurry.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="492">Q: And so you are married?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="493">A: I was married, yes.</sentence><sentence id="494">And then my husband decided perhaps he should go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and so he didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> until after we were married.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: You stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> together?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: For a period, but the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> he went to was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span>, and so we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span> for four years until he got his degree.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="501">Q: What was it like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, you continued to work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="503">A: Yes, we had our bombings and hiding in <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>, and eventually I think a lot of people gave up and just took their chances.</sentence><sentence id="504">And of course we had the blackout.</sentence><sentence id="505">It was very difficult to find your way around because in those days we still had these famous London fogs that you only see in Sherlock Holmes films nowadays and I can remember ending up in somebody else's <span class="DLF">yard</span> at the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it really was quite impossible to see and find your way around.</sentence><sentence id="506">On the other hand one felt very, very safe.</sentence><sentence id="507">You know you'd walk around without being able to see anybody and people would talk to you and as a young girl, you never felt afraid to walk about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="513">Q: What was, as far as Europe, what was happening in Europe and the holocaust there, the in time...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="515">A: Well one didn't really know how horrible it all was, you know.</sentence><sentence id="516">And we still heard from my father for some time.</sentence><sentence id="517">But I'd just like to back when we first came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">My mother couldn't speak English so she went to the East end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, which was the Jewish part in those days, and she could speak Yiddish, and she went from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>, from <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, and asked somebody if they could guarantee for my father to come out, because he could come if you had somebody that would guarantee for you, and in fact she found somebody who offered him a job, and his papers were being processed and the war broke out, so he lost his second chance there.</sentence><sentence id="519">So I'm only saying</sentence><sentence id="521">6 that just to add again what a brave woman my mother was, making a decision for us to leave without him with two children and very little money, and then she immediately set about trying to get him out, and so she was really a very active woman because we relied a lot on her before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> too because when we had our business eventually wholesalers wouldn't deliver to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shops</span>, so my mother used to get up at 5:00 in the morning and go to the <span class="BUILDING">markets</span> and bring in the eggs and the butter so we could still sell the stuff in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="522">So she really was a very, very strong, active woman.</sentence><sentence id="523">But now getting back to after the war started, we heard from my father until about 1940, because we had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> so he could send the mail via these two addresses.</sentence><sentence id="524">Just recently I came across a postcard from him actually and which I think historically is quite interesting because he gives his address in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, which was, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was Gesshue(ph) and it says "<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>" and in brackets "Formally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>."</sentence><sentence id="525">So in effect you see once the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the address had to be <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="526">It is interesting, isn't it?</sentence><sentence id="527">Until I looked through all the stuff my mother left behind, I didn't realize how really historically interesting that must be that they had to write their address "<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>," and in brackets "Formally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="528">Q: What were the, what did you hear from your father, any indication of what was going on?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="529">A: There were only a few <span class="DLF">lines</span> actually, we haven't heard for such a long time, are you well, I'm sorry you have to work so hard, write, and you know that's just these few <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="530">And my husband actually he died three years ago but before that went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because apparently they have quite a few archives there too, to see if he could find out what happened to my family, but they had records of people who died a natural death, but not records of people who were eventually sent away or deported so we never found out what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="533">Q: So eventually the correspondence just stopped?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="538">A: Correspondence stopped yes.</sentence><sentence id="539">And of course the Red Cross made all sorts of inquiries so you know nobody turned up after the war, so one knew that they had gone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="542">Q: What was it like when you first, when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, what was it like?</sentence><sentence id="543">Was it easy to acclimate?</sentence><sentence id="544">You spoke at least a little bit of English.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="548">A: Yes well, I must have spoken quite a lot, because I was sent out to do the shopping, and of course I was in that <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span>, and the matron that ran it only spoke English, and I think I probably learned quite a lot looking after the children too.</sentence><sentence id="549">So, I seemed to have, as I say, learned it very quickly, because I can remember after I got married being ill, and the doctors saying to my husband, "That's a real Londoner you've got there, isn't it?"</sentence><sentence id="550">So I must have lost my accent fairly quickly too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: So it was fairly easy acclimating?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: Yes, for me it was, yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="558">Q: How about your mother.</sentence><sentence id="559">She sounded like she, where were you living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, was it East end?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="562">A: No, no, we weren't living in the East end, at one time we were living in <span class="DLF">Klisl(ph) Park</span>, and then eventually we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Hampstead</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">Actually only about a year before I got married we took on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flat</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="566">Q: And did you become involved in the Jewish community at all besides.........</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="568">A: Well, not an awful lot.</sentence><sentence id="569">We had Jewish friends and I had one particular friend from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> actually, who eventually emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and I am still in touch with her and I even went to see her in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, and some of the people from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, although I hadn't remembered them but when we had this reunion to make the documentary, actually they only had nine of us because that's</sentence><sentence id="571">8 all they could afford, three people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and six from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and three of the six, I am going to see on this trip.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="576">Q: So, you were married, and then you eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="578">A: We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheffield</span> for my husband to do his studies.</sentence><sentence id="579">And he did a degree in glass technology(ph) which is an unusual subject, but before he finished his studies in 1946 we brought his parents over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because they had, in fact, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakoff(ph</span>) and as the Germans marched in they marched out towards the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> and eventually the Russians sent them right deep into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and although they had an awful war, there were no worse off than of the Russians because nobody had any food, so they were discriminated against where they were and they came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakoff(ph</span>) right after the war, and then we brought them over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they always said they had been the happiest years of their lives.</sentence><sentence id="580">So that was great.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="584">Q: So after the war everything was fine?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="587">I mean we lead perfectly normal lives.</sentence><sentence id="588">We had our first child in 1950, a daughter who lives in <span class="REGION">California</span>, and we had two more children, one of them we lost he died at the age of 18, he had polio and eventually ended up in a car accident in an invalid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and then I have a son in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and I have now left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to live near him since I lost my husband.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="592">Q: Is there anything else you would like to add?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="594">A: Well, I think perhaps everything that is of interest I have told you because once I got married we lead a fairly ordinary life, perhaps not so ordinary as far as people are concerned now because we brought his parents over, we kept them for awhile, and it isn't often that the children are responsible for parents, it is normally the other way around.</sentence><sentence id="595">But it was such a normal thing in those days.</sentence><sentence id="596">You never felt that you had been hard done by or you did more than you should have done.</sentence><sentence id="597">I think we often felt very sad about my mother.</sentence><sentence id="598">You don't realize until it happens to you.</sentence><sentence id="599">My mother had 18</sentence><sentence id="601">9 years of married life and when we were youngsters we thought that was a long time, but obviously it isn't a long time.</sentence><sentence id="602">And so she really had a very hard time.</sentence><sentence id="603">We often felt sorry for her, but she was never a miserable person, and all she said was "I just want to see my daughters married," and when she saw her daughters married, "I just want to see my grandchildren," you know, so really there's always people always hope for more.</sentence><sentence id="604">And then eventually she even saw her great-grandchildren so that was great.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="616">Q: So she went on the best that she could?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="618">A: She died in her 91st year, so really...and dearly loved by everybody.</sentence><sentence id="619">Her sons-in-law thought she wonderful because she never interfered.</sentence><sentence id="620">And so we really had a very nice family life, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="624">Q: You were saying earlier that you didn't find any difficulty talking about your experiences and do you have any reflections on the Holocaust and what happened in Europe and what may have happened to you and what may have happened to your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="626">A: Well, it's something that I think is horrendous, but it's quite difficult to comprehend even though you know it has all happened.</sentence><sentence id="627">And I must say that I watch all the films and things and people always say to me "Why do you punish yourself like that?"</sentence><sentence id="628">And I just feel that at least I must experience second-hand what these people went through.</sentence><sentence id="629">I think it's a cowardly attitude to say, "I can't watch these things" because if my family could go through it at least I should know and get upset by what they've been through.</sentence><sentence id="630">But everybody has to deal with things in their own way, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="631">But not to want to know, I think, is really denying the fact that these people existed and what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="632">Well I hope you feel happy with what I've told you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="640">Q: [really appreciate you taking the time to do it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="642">A: Yes, but do you feel you've had sufficiently out of this interview, or did you want to ask me any questions?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="646">Q: I think it was very good, and it's important that being young at the time, you only told us what you actually saw, that's good and it's very important.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="647">A: Yes, but when people have talked to me before I always felt I had to be honest about the fact that you cannot really know exactly what you have experienced or what you remember from your experience or what you've read since.</sentence><sentence id="648">And I think perhaps everybody must feel that difficulty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="651">Q: Yeah, I think that's something you are obviously very conscious of because there are things.</sentence><sentence id="652">It has been 50 years, 60 years, and obviously there are a lot of life experiences and a lot of knowledge since then that incorporate into our memories, and it's important that we find this out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="655">A: Well, thank you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
