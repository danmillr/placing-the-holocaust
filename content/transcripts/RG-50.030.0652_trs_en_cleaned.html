<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Wh-When they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: They were very young.</sentence><sentence id="46">I think -- well, 1914 when the war broke out, so they were either 16 or 17 years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="49">Q: And how did they meet?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: That is a puzzle.</sentence><sentence id="52">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="53">I think that the Jewish population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was pretty large.</sentence><sentence id="54">I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> itself was -- had a population of about two and a half million, and about 200,000 were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="55">And so apparently the people that came from the same areas in the -- <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, because the Hapsburg Empire at that time was really large, before the first World War, and encompassed much of <span class="REGION">western Poland</span>, and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and went as far as down to northern -- what later became <span class="REGION">northern Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">And so there was a lot of social activity going on, and I</sentence><sentence id="58">really don't quite know how they really met.</sentence><sentence id="59">All I knew that I was a child that really be -- that came in 1923, so the war was over in 1918, so this was a very difficult economic time, and I -- not very much was talked about on how they met, and I really never found out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="69">Q: Did they speak --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: I should have been much more inquisitive.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="71">Q: What -- what language did they speak with each other?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="73">A: They spoke German and Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="74">And my -- I think they both knew some Polish, but I don't think -- think -- because their schooling both was done in ger -- in German, because I think that the Austrian empire at that time went as far east as where they lived.</sentence><sentence id="75">And most of the Jewish populations in these small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, either had a chayder, which was a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, where things were taught in Hebrew and in Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="76">And then I think there was another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I attended, which was in German.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: What kind of -- 0-obviously they were Jewish, what kind of religious backgrounds did they have?</sentence><sentence id="82">Did they have different tradition --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Ah, it was Orthodox.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Both of them?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Did -- did they keep a different religious life as adults than they had -- had as children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Yeah, we joined a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in -- when I grew up.</sentence><sentence id="98">And I think that was rather late.</sentence><sentence id="99">At that time there were small, and I think it then continued also in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, there were little, itty-bitty <span class="BUILDING">storefronts</span>, which functioned at high holidays, and a rabbi somehow, he was -- had another job, and then he conducted services at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; the two, you know, very important Jewish holidays.</sentence><sentence id="100">And they were sometimes held at a <span class="BUILDING">storefront</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">But we belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">conservative synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when I was growing up.</sentence><sentence id="102">I don't know what the sh -- really religious affiliations were before I was born.</sentence><sentence id="103">I just never really -- was so, I guess involved with the present time, and changes that took place culturally, and language- wise, and new <span class="NPIP">locations</span>, and all the things that took place that I think that the inquisitiveness was not there to find out how all these things really came to be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="112">Did your father serve in World War I?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: What part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> did you live in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: In the 20" district, which was a -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had 21 <span class="REGION">districts</span>, the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">inner city</span>, where all the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, <span class="BUILDING">museums</span>, and the opera</sentence><sentence id="153">and all the <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> were and the -- was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central Vienna</span>, and it -- even though it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">20" district</span>, it -- it joined the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">second district</span>, which was very -- it had a very substantial Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="154">The 20" <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> also had a good size -- well, not so [indecipherable] but had a sprinkling of Jewish population.</sentence><sentence id="155">And it was next to the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> and the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, it was pretty close within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">inner city</span>, even though the numbers really were the disparity.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: They had a religious -- they had a -- Catholics had a priest come in and the class was separated at that time, twice a week, I think, maybe an hour each time.</sentence><sentence id="263">The same thing, we had a Jewish rabbi that came in, the students would be pulled out, the Jewish students, and took religious in-instruction.</sentence><sentence id="264">I think that still is the German way of doing things, I think they still do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="335">A: The -- it's -- what stands out in my memory, and it sometimes fades out, but I still remember, in 1938 -- January of 1938, at that time the German and

up at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, coming back from that school vacation, they seemed at edge, and explained to me that things were not doing very well.</sentence><sentence id="344">They had received information and in contact with some friends or relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- and as you know, Hitler took over 1933, and at that time, the Nuremberg
