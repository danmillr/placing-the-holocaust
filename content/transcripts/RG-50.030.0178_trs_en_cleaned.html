<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: What was life like for you?</sentence><sentence id="171">Did life change for you as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: Uh...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Uh... Yes.</sentence><sentence id="207">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="208">I needed to find a situation...a solution to..uh...my situation and I found one when I asked the Spanish Legation for asylum.</sentence><sentence id="209">Uh...Because I had fought in the Spanish Civil War, I could take advantage of the fact that the Spanish government had said that anyone who had fought...any foreigner who fought in this war who should ever find himself in difficulties could turn to the Spanish Diplomatic authorities for help.</sentence><sentence id="210">And...uh...] ask therefore the Spanish government to give me a passport if...if I thought that I needed and temporary citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="211">I didn't actually get it right away.</sentence><sentence id="212">I didn't go and pick up my passport right away.</sentence><sentence id="213">Uh...in...in March 1944, and I hid for one week in the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish extraterritorial buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">Then the Hungarian government notified me that I was to be interned and so I presented myself and I was interned from the beginning of April to October 13th, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="215">During that time I could not follow the situation closely because I wasn't in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">We did hear...uh...about unpleasant...we did hear about unpleasant news.</sentence><sentence id="217">Uh...We...we could read papers, but there was censorship.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Uh...On October 13th, 1943, I was very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="266">I had these fake papers which authorized me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> for health reasons.</sentence><sentence id="267">They weren't...it wasn't really true but anyway I had the papers.</sentence><sentence id="268">Luckily, that morning a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swiss diplomatic car</span> arrived with a Swiss diplomatic and an Hungarian diplomatic who came to visit the internees where we were and check on me.</sentence><sentence id="269">And that day I asked them to take me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">Of course, they inquired about my documents and they realized they were fake, but they took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> anyway and that was on the 13th.</sentence><sentence id="271">On the 15th, Admiral Hortee proclaimed Armistice and....uh...but...uh...he specified in August of 44...it specified in August 44, Admiral Hortee had fired.</sentence><sentence id="272">I must specific...I'm sorry, in August 1944, Admiral Hortee had fired the Nazi government, had eliminated the Nazi government and set up in its <span class="NPIP">place</span> a military government which is headed by General Lackatosh.</sentence><sentence id="273">Uh...This government first abolished the Star of David, the wearing the Star of David, and struck down the racial laws.</sentence><sentence id="274">So for about a month the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> lived in relative peace.</sentence><sentence id="275">For example on October 14th, I lunched with a Jewish Hungarian in a big <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">On the next day on the 15th, I lunched with Mrs. De Franco, who is also Jewish Hungarian married to a Italian diplomatic in a <span class="BUILDING">public restaurant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">And during this lunch we heard that Admiral Hortee had proclaimed armistice to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> and Anglo-Americans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q:</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: He had said he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment</span> in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="293">Did he mean 1944?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: 44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="299">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="300">After you...what happened to you after this luncheon in October of 44 with Senora DeFranco.</sentence><sentence id="301">Where did you go and what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="306">A: Uh...This lady was very fearful when she heard this news which was being repeated on the radio, broadcast over and over again.</sentence><sentence id="307">Anyhow, I...I didn't know what to do and so I decided to seek refuge in my Hungarian friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="308">But after a few days they asked me to leave because they said it was dangerous for them...uh...because the Germans and the Hungarians...the Nazi Hungarians had bombarded the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Palace</span>, and Admiral Hortee was taken prisoner and...and taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">And immediately following these events, the real anti-Jewish terror began.</sentence><sentence id="310">At least that's what I saw.</sentence><sentence id="311">And the wearing of the star was imposed once again.</sentence><sentence id="312">But anyhow, I left my friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went to a <span class="BUILDING">private hospital</span> but even there after a few days the Director asked me to leave for...uh...same reasons.</sentence><sentence id="313">The next morning, therefore, I decided to ask...to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish Legation</span> to ask for the passport that the Spanish government had promised me in September 43 but which I didn't pick up because I didn't want to change nationality at the time.</sentence><sentence id="314">Uh...So...uh...we went...I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and they had to write up a letter saying they had searched for me a few years and that they finally found me and so that we could proceed with the change of citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="315">So together with a...an attorney from the Spanish Legation, we went to the Hungarian Ministry of Interior where my Italian citizenship was abolished and I became a Spanish citizen.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I was asked to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> within 15 days.</sentence><sentence id="317">Naturally, I couldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="318">Where...where could I go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Please.</sentence><sentence id="333">Continue.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="339">BREAK IN TAPE</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Un...When I returned from the Ministry to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>, there was a lot of confusion.</sentence><sentence id="341">There were a lot of people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">Some of them were wearing the star.</sentence><sentence id="343">Some were not.</sentence><sentence id="344">There were about a hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="345">I asked the attorney what was happening and he responded that the Jews were seeking protection, but the Legation had a problem because the only one Christian who could handle all the workload because the...the attorney told me he was also Jewish, and that he was a war hero.</sentence><sentence id="346">He had been a war hero during World War I. And so anyway they had this problem because they had...didn't have enough people and they even had at one point 300 people who had been protected and who were taken away and they did not know anything about their whereabouts.</sentence><sentence id="347">So at that point I went to the and I told that what I had just learned myself and offered my help.</sentence><sentence id="348">He replied that...uh...he would be willing and happy to work...to have me work with him, but he couldn't pay me.</sentence><sentence id="349">And I said that I didn't need any money, that I had enough to live on in those days.</sentence><sentence id="350">So we had one more letter written up to the Ministry...to the Foreign Affairs Ministry of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which we took over with...uh...Sanspritz which...uh... was an official statement that I was a member of the Spanish Legation and we had it...a stamp put on it, and I also got my diplomatic identify card...uh...

10 days more than necessary so that I could protect him.</sentence><sentence id="456">But now I have chosen to tell the truth.</sentence><sentence id="457">However, I can't give you any more details

day of November or the first day of December and I don't remember exactly which one, Sanspritz, who is a diplomat, a career diplomat left.</sentence><sentence id="463">And so I was trying to decide what to do.</sentence><sentence id="464">I'd heard by the way that he'd left at about 6:00 AM...uh...through a phone call and I don't remember if it was him...if he personally who called me or someone else, a legal attache or what.</sentence><sentence id="465">But anyway, I learned that he was...that he'd left.</sentence><sentence id="466">And so I took a walk around the <span

few suitcases and...uh...the people, the Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> told me that the police want...wanted to take them away.</sentence><sentence id="467">So I decided to lock the <span class="DLF">door</span> and...uh...L...I went to see the lieutenant and I asked him what was happening and I told him that he couldn't do this because the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is being protected...uh...by the Spaniards and he needed my permission, and I was surprised at his behavior since he was part of the regular police forces.</sentence><sentence id="468">He was not a parliamentary police force.</sentence><sentence id="469">So we came to an agreement.</sentence><sentence id="470">The police agreed to postpone everything for a few days and we went to a <span class="DLF">park</span> where we met with these members who belonged to a committee which have representatives from police force, Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and I protested what was happening and someone told me that the...that they had heard that the Spanish representative had fled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so there was no more relations with the Spanish Government.</sentence><sentence id="471">I told him that he was wrong and that the Spanish had not fled but that he'd went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to talk with his colleagues from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and at the meantime I was his legal substitute and I had documents to prove it.</sentence><sentence id="472">Uh... demanded that the Hungarians...uh...uh...respect the agreement that...that existed between <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and <span

had remained faithful, loyal to Hortee after October 15th.</sentence><sentence id="598">And, of course, all Hungarians still looked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hortee</span>.</sentence><sentence

class="DLF">road</span>, and Iwas on foot,on<span class="DLF">__ Street</span> which is a big <span class="DLF">street</span>, I saw that some Hungarian Nazis were chasing a child who was probably seven or eight years old.</sentence><sentence id="789">They reached him and one of them shot the child in the back of the head.</sentence><sentence id="790">I was quite struck by this naturally and I asked a passerby why, what did that child do?</sentence><sentence id="791">Who is he?</sentence><sentence id="792">And he said he's Jewish.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="793">From the roofs of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, however, there were some Jews who were shooting against the Nazis from the <span class="BUILDING">rooftop houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">But anyway I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> andI found --__ who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then he gave me the passport.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="795">And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had fought in the civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume citizenship, Spanish citizenship.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="796">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE So we were...with this letter 1 went together with the legal attache...we went to the Minister of Interior where I changed citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="797">I canceled the Italian one and I assumed Spanish citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="798">When I returned to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> that early morning, it was probably eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="799">I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and that many of these people who were there had were wearing the David Star, Star of David, and I asked the legal attache what was happening and he said that these were people who are asking for our protection, protection from the Spanish government but right now we're in difficulty because the only Christian legation is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="800">And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help, then I...maybe I can do something, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> and I told him I'm available if you need me, and he said yes.</sentence><sentence id="801">Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to survive on my own.</sentence><sentence id="802">And so I started immediately.</sentence><sentence id="803">I started working immediately.</sentence><sentence id="804">The first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to start, but then after speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and also with the Chancellor and with other people who were there who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of the refugees and so I realized what could be done.</sentence><sentence id="805">The first thing was to try to get back about three hundred people who had been protected by <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="806">They had about three hundred, only three hundred at that time because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I didn't, didn't accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find those</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="810">5 who had been protected, of the three hundred protected.</sentence><sentence id="811">Of the three hundred I was able to get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh <span class="BUILDING">Merchandise Depot</span>, at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and also by going to the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and say <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and those who had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back.</sentence><sentence id="812">It seems to me we had rented two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> but I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or we reserved a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>...I, I don't really remember how that happened.</sentence><sentence id="813">I was with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="814">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="815">So I started working.</sentence><sentence id="816">I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it, edit this tape... ..So the episode at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>...you can take it from the other tape and put it together, piece it together. (</sentence><sentence id="817">Pause- Technical Conversation) The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> they were loading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train cars</span> with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true, that they were going to work.</sentence><sentence id="818">They were people who were being deported and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a laborer.</sentence><sentence id="819">He went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but on the trip between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and the <span class="DLF">border</span> he understood...I don't know how...but he understood that it was a trick and so he jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="820">And he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to .</sentence><sentence id="821">I don't think that that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> existed yet but anyway he came to one of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish houses</span>, so...this episode of the two twins...at a certain point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if anybody was there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years old.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="822">They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="823">Get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="824">Run to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">Get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">Close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and then the chauffeur will know what he has to do.</sentence><sentence id="827">Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could communicate with these people.</sentence><sentence id="828">At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went.</sentence><sentence id="829">One Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no.</sentence><sentence id="830">They were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="831">It's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Spanish car</span> and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was extra-territorial property.</sentence><sentence id="832">He insisted.</sentence><sentence id="833">He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="834">You can't...you can't commit any violent acts.</sentence><sentence id="835">He said look.</sentence><sentence id="836">He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I replied that you call this work.</sentence><sentence id="837">That's what I asked him.</sentence><sentence id="838">And so he got even more angry.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="839">He wanted the kids back.</sentence><sentence id="840">And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad.</sentence><sentence id="841">I thought my God, this man is crazy.</sentence><sentence id="842">He could shoot us.</sentence><sentence id="843">He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a big big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling.</sentence><sentence id="844">I was screaming.</sentence><sentence id="845">Wallenberg, the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span>...everyone intervened in the discussion.</sentence><sentence id="846">There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come too for the kids.</sentence><sentence id="847">And so they left.</sentence><sentence id="848">And then I brought these <span class="BUILDING">kids home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="849">I brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and I was surprised to see that they were</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="853">6 really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical.</sentence><sentence id="854">The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical.</sentence><sentence id="855">This is an episode that struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, these two episodes made me reflect very much.</sentence><sentence id="856">It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware of the situation.</sentence><sentence id="857">From the end of March to October 13th, I was not... had been interned away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>...I continued my work.</sentence><sentence id="858">I stopped looking for the three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network.</sentence><sentence id="859">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="860">I don't remember where it was. (</sentence><sentence id="861">Technical conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="862">Maybe two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> we had already.</sentence><sentence id="863">Maybe they were ___ wherever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long</span> was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important.</sentence><sentence id="864">I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately.</sentence><sentence id="865">Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in.</sentence><sentence id="866">We would go to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and type up these letters.</sentence><sentence id="867">Sanspritz didn't know anything because we used his signature pad.</sentence><sentence id="868">He didn't know how many.</sentence><sentence id="869">His job was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister.</sentence><sentence id="870">So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November.</sentence><sentence id="871">To be more specific...I couldn't be more specific than that.</sentence><sentence id="872">I think we maybe reached three thousand, more or less.</sentence><sentence id="873">It wasn't very easy.</sentence><sentence id="874">Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter of protection and to escort these people to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they had to be escorted to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> after all.</sentence><sentence id="875">I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> uh as the letters of protection were issued.</sentence><sentence id="876">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> who were available and who shuttled back and forth between the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where they were going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for everything.</sentence><sentence id="877">We had to get them settled.</sentence><sentence id="878">Normally these <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the rent.</sentence><sentence id="879">We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that.</sentence><sentence id="880">They did especially they would try to attack those <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Swiss houses</span> because they had a a system of protection which was not correct.</sentence><sentence id="881">In other words, they had given, both of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection.</sentence><sentence id="882">To sum it up these letters were being sold.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="883">The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="884">I think that as far as I know <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> issued forty million letters of protection and in its <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> it had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard.</sentence><sentence id="885">They weren't rumors.</sentence><sentence id="886">I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="887">That's not correct.</sentence><sentence id="888">These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it.</sentence><sentence id="889">The authorities know about it.</sentence><sentence id="890">Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken.</sentence><sentence id="891">We had to protect them.</sentence><sentence id="892">With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> of representing various factions which were ferocious.</sentence><sentence id="893">They killed.</sentence><sentence id="894">They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="898">7 protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="899">Sometimes it was useless.</sentence><sentence id="900">It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because if you go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they'll take, they take you away.</sentence><sentence id="901">They put you in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times.</sentence><sentence id="902">They would go and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things.</sentence><sentence id="903">Or for whatever reasons, their own reasons.</sentence><sentence id="904">I even created the committees in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from leaving the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and going on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="905">They had to remain <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because there they were safe.</sentence><sentence id="906">If they left the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, they were no longer safe.</sentence><sentence id="907">They would take their stars off and they would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers and what papers could they show.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="908">They didn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="909">If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then.</sentence><sentence id="910">And so we had to find uh food for them and security besides watching.</sentence><sentence id="911">We were pretty lucky.</sentence><sentence id="912">It was a continuous job because we had to travel throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> continuously to show the flag, to show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and little by little with the with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>...I would go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were organized.</sentence><sentence id="913">We tried with a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> too but it was but it failed.</sentence><sentence id="914">The...it was my idea but it was a bad idea.</sentence><sentence id="915">It didn't go well.</sentence><sentence id="916">So weeks went on.</sentence><sentence id="917">Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities.</sentence><sentence id="918">Quite the contrary.</sentence><sentence id="919">I made as many contacts as possible.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="920">I...one day for example I took ...I don't know what that is...I took twenty-five thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money.</sentence><sentence id="921">OK.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="922">This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpetia</span> and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every time, every time I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where he...I went up to see him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example.</sentence><sentence id="923">For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the Legation to visit a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...he never visited any of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="924">He didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="925">He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used with his signature pad because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision.</sentence><sentence id="926">He was an old-timer diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="927">This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="928">Not only of Jews but also the uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> there were many uh...uh they had orchestras.</sentence><sentence id="929">They played the violins and they had <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and they played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> (ph)... .</sentence><sentence id="930">I'm sorry...] can't find the word...you know...these traveling homeless kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies, gypsies....thank you.</sentence><sentence id="931">Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="932">Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="933">Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="934">I couldn't find the word...sorry...OK. (</sentence><sentence id="935">Pause) In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> on...day and night I went to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and I had meals and in the evenings they had orchestras.</sentence><sentence id="936">They were played by the gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="937">And</sentence></p><p><sentence id="940">8 there was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Square</span>, where there was a good orchestra and there were a couple of good violinists.</sentence><sentence id="941">One day they disappeared, in January of "42 I think it was.</sentence><sentence id="942">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="943">January of 1942 they disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="944">I asked the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, what happened to the orchestra, the band.</sentence><sentence id="945">And he said well...at first he didn't really want to answer.</sentence><sentence id="946">He was reticent, and then he said the Germans took them off, because they are of an inferior race.</sentence><sentence id="947">So they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were many of them, and the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="948">Not only uh Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is something that I saw.</sentence><sentence id="949">This is not something that I just heard.</sentence><sentence id="950">I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="951">So, so we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> left.</sentence><sentence id="952">I don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist.</sentence><sentence id="953">Uh it seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th.</sentence><sentence id="954">He told me November 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not.</sentence><sentence id="955">Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="956">I found myself that morning, early in the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and II visited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> thinking what do I do now?</sentence><sentence id="957">What is the situation?</sentence><sentence id="958">And in a certain sense the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Street, Number 25, where the child was in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...he reminded me of some details the other day when I saw him for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="959">He recalled some details that I didn't remember.</sentence><sentence id="960">I saw besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="961">He exaggerates.</sentence><sentence id="962">As a child, he thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like that, but anyhow that's how he saw it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="963">That's his mentality.</sentence><sentence id="964">More or less that's how it was, but I wasn't screaming.</sentence><sentence id="965">I wasn't yelling.</sentence><sentence id="966">So I saw...I entered this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I said, what is happening here.</sentence><sentence id="967">They were...they told us oh they want to take us away.</sentence><sentence id="968">The police want to deport us.</sentence><sentence id="969">And sure enough the regular police was there.</sentence><sentence id="970">Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which was commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want.</sentence><sentence id="971">I've got to take everyone away.</sentence><sentence id="972">And I closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in front of him.</sentence><sentence id="973">I locked it, and I said look, no one is leaving.</sentence><sentence id="974">The Spanish flag is here.</sentence><sentence id="975">The Spanish emblem is here.</sentence><sentence id="976">This...we consider this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> extra-territorial property.</sentence><sentence id="977">It wasn't legal.</sentence><sentence id="978">It wasn't right, but what governs such governments, you could just say...you could make up things like that.</sentence><sentence id="979">It couldn't have been an extra-territorial house.</sentence><sentence id="980">You needed special permission from the government.</sentence><sentence id="981">The government had not given any special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would postpone the...and together we would go to the <span class="DLF">park</span>, in the center of the <span class="DLF">park</span>, where there was a committee composed of various police forces, the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven or eight people.</sentence><sentence id="982">And I went there to speak with these people and I spoke with energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.</sentence><sentence id="983">You had to assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and you had to be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take these uh people away.</sentence><sentence id="984">He said because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> fled.</sentence><sentence id="985">Who said that he fled?</sentence><sentence id="986"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> took a trip.</sentence><sentence id="987">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back.</sentence><sentence id="988">But in the meantime | am his...the legal representative of the Spanish government and charge d'affaires and I showed him my passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign</sentence></p><p><sentence id="991">9 Affairs Minister representative said yes, this man is uh right what he said, so that's the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="992">The only thing is that uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> really did leave.</sentence><sentence id="993">He did flee, and he didn't have any intentions of coming back.</sentence><sentence id="994">So much so that he didn't even tell me that he was leaving.</sentence><sentence id="995">He didn't tell me anything.</sentence><sentence id="996">Nothing at all.</sentence><sentence id="997">He left.</sentence><sentence id="998">And I learned about it when he was already at the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="999">He left at four or five in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1000">Anyway, but that's not important.</sentence><sentence id="1001">Perhaps it was a good thing.</sentence><sentence id="1002">It was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had invaded that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the successor to the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry said OK.</sentence><sentence id="1003">You're right.</sentence><sentence id="1004">The situation is legal.</sentence><sentence id="1005">Uh and I said look, there's a flag at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1006">There's a flag at all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> too, and he said...we had an agreement that after two or three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the Spanish position and in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the Legation, I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to the Legation.</sentence><sentence id="1007">Danielson wanted to get some money...some Swiss francs.</sentence><sentence id="1008">They're about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protested at...this is who is the Chancellor, and I said what do we do now.</sentence><sentence id="1009">We still had some _, some money left and not very much.</sentence><sentence id="1010">She didn't know what to do and she said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1011">I called Minister Danielson.</sentence><sentence id="1012">I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see him later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of the Spanish Legation would no longer exist.</sentence><sentence id="1013">So we continued to work. .</sentence><sentence id="1014">The situation in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> came back to normal and while I was there in the <span class="DLF">park</span> I saw that there was a column of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving and so I went to see and I saw that these were some of the people protected from another <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of the same <span class="DLF">street</span>, the <span class="DLF">Street</span>, of Number 33 which was very close, and so I made them give me back.</sentence><sentence id="1015">The situation in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was probably, was pretty normal and peaceful.</sentence><sentence id="1016">I don't know what those questions refer to. (</sentence><sentence id="1017">He hasn't understood the question.)</sentence><sentence id="1018">There were...you mean...are you referring to the quantity of people who were there, the sleeping conditions, the eating conditions...what are you referring to?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1020">In during December, the first ten days of December, we took some other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>...the last two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, it seems to me.</sentence><sentence id="1021">But the...from a point of view of the living conditions it was a very difficult situation and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, there were five hundred people. _</sentence><sentence id="1022">told me that they slept on the <span class="DLF">steps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1023">I don't remember exactly even though there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but I don't remember how many there were exactly, because...I must step forward here.</sentence><sentence id="1024">The morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were protected because you never know.</sentence><sentence id="1025">If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed everything.</sentence><sentence id="1026">The Chancellor didn't want to.</sentence><sentence id="1027">She wanted to save a few things, and I said no.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1028">Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall be left in the hands of the Russians because the Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I expected, had predicted.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1029">And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left.</sentence><sentence id="1030">The situation was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1031">As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food.</sentence><sentence id="1032">It was difficult for the hygienic conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1033">It was difficult to find medicines.</sentence><sentence id="1034">There was a difficult time, for</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1037">0 example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">The Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor.</sentence><sentence id="1039">I went to the police commander and I demanded that the water be returned.</sentence><sentence id="1040">These things cannot be done because if there is a protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1041">If there is no water, I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1042">With five hundred people and and if it were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1043">And then there was the problem of food.</sentence><sentence id="1044">We had to feed these people.</sentence><sentence id="1045">At a certain point there was no more money left from the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>...this was Hungarian money in the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1046">I spent some of my money that I had in my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, and so I went to the Jewish Council, , and they gave me some money and then they didn't have any left either.</sentence><sentence id="1047">They, they were just in terrible conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1048">They had nothing left to eat themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1049">I must uh say that in the month of August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the first measures that was taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were being dismantled and brought down, and so many people went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where they had lived.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1050">Not everyone lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1051">Some of them lived in <span

(ph).</sentence><sentence id="1053">They were farmers.</sentence><sentence id="1054">The, the Jewish, the Jews of that <span class="REGION">area</span> were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do.</sentence><sentence id="1055">They forced uh these Jews from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and...those who had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>...and they concentrated them in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, which could support maybe two, three million people...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand people, and so there was this black, terrible hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1056">There was...there were infections.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1057">There were diseases.</sentence><sentence id="1058">They was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1059">There was no electricity.</sentence><sentence id="1060">There, there was nothing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1061">They had nothing to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1062">And so this uh Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we had two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> which were really not ours but one belonged to the International Red Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all.</sentence><sentence id="1063">On the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> I bought condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1064">And we had uh...it was very expensive.</sentence><sentence id="1065">We had to pay for it dearly on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, but there were many children.</sentence><sentence id="1066">There were children in the two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> and there were children in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, the protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1067">And since the Jewish Council which whose name was ; , which means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any money left, wasn't giving any money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financially, economically.</sentence><sentence id="1068">They said...they would tell me which people could give money.</sentence><sentence id="1069">And so I went to these people...not every day...and I said give meathousand _.</sentence><sentence id="1070">You can give me five thousand, near five...according to their capabilities.</sentence><sentence id="1071">And these people gave me money.</sentence><sentence id="1072">But somebody would say, why.</sentence><sentence id="1073">Why should I give you money?</sentence><sentence id="1074">And I would say because you have the money.</sentence><sentence id="1075">We need the money.</sentence><sentence id="1076">I don't have any.</sentence><sentence id="1077">The Legation doesn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="1078">What...what will we use to buy food with.</sentence><sentence id="1079">And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> anymore, and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1082">1 so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had.</sentence><sentence id="1083">And this food was distributed because I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1084">There would have been fights because hunger is hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1085">A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right, don't you think?</sentence><sentence id="1086">And so therefore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day, week after week, and we finally come to the day of Christmas Eve, which was a terrible day...because the Russians, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> considered themselves in a state of war.</sentence><sentence id="1087">Anyhow, I always kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1088">Yes...yes... it's started.</sentence><sentence id="1089">Uh Christmas Day I remember that I left.</sentence><sentence id="1090">On Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left.</sentence><sentence id="1091">I spent uh...that evening and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1092">It was in late afternoon and I thought that I would eat there but when I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> I found that there were elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they told me that it's not possible to pass through because the Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to go.</sentence><sentence id="1093">I'm, I'm a diplomat and I have to go to the, all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was very close, a hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and then you have to come back.</sentence><sentence id="1094">Otherwise it's uh your business.</sentence><sentence id="1095">I said OK.</sentence><sentence id="1096">So I went and I found that everything was topsy-turvy.</sentence><sentence id="1097">We had sixty refugees in the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and, and I understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1098">They, they had made a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="1099">It was big because they had...they cut it down from the <span class="DLF">park</span> and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and you would go down to the second...the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and it was all...it was a Christmas tree that was, that took up two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and was full of presents and I looked at the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to everyone and I left.</sentence><sentence id="1100">And I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1101">I was...didn't go back to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> because the next day it was burnt by a German grenade.</sentence><sentence id="1102">That evening, which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> too...it's...there's a big supper on Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the _<span class="BUILDING">__ Hotel</span> by the Secretary of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to ask me to pay for the Spanish passports.</sentence><sentence id="1103">They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave the Spanish passports to them.</sentence><sentence id="1104">That's now true.</sentence><sentence id="1105">It's not true.</sentence><sentence id="1106">If they had asked it from me, I don't know what I would have done.</sentence><sentence id="1107">I would have judged...assessed the situation at the time and I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would have sold the passports in exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1108">So we lunched together and we spoke about everything except politics.</sentence><sentence id="1109">We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the movies.</sentence><sentence id="1110">And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1111">So we left.</sentence><sentence id="1112">And I was happy because he didn't ask me anything.</sentence><sentence id="1113">He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate question to hand over a passport.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Yes, I did have passports to give, but if if the question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this.</sentence><sentence id="1115">He's not authorized to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1119">2 give out passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Even though there are Hungarian newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1121">In fact, during the trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even want an escort that evening.</sentence><sentence id="1122">I said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he would...and I just need someone to take me to some...to the Legation or to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that's all, because I had many <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I could go and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1123">At a certain point, I was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who asked me to see my passport and they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer valid.</sentence><sentence id="1124">And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is my name.</sentence><sentence id="1125">These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1126">You can't touch this man.</sentence><sentence id="1127">He's a diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="1128">He represents <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and so he sent them away, and so they escorted me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1129">And I decided that I would go spend the night in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in uh , in <span class="DLF">Street, Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1130">I invited this lieutenant to come and have a drink with me and he told me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were about to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and there was only one <span class="DLF">street</span> open left, and that's why I understood that the minister who had been in such a hurry to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And so the next morning I tried to get in touch with the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>, because I had left two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there and I needed those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1132">One belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> and another had been lent to me that morning by an Italian citizen because the only two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that I had in the Legation were not working, and so he lent me this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the next day the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was burnt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1133">The whole <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> was destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="1134">Nothing was left.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Of my stuff, one girl saved five handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136">She didn't want to hang the handkerchiefs on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> with everything else and this girl came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the last minute before the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> burnt and she uh got the box with the handkerchiefs and after three months, she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to give me the handkerchiefs.</sentence><sentence id="1137">That morning...that Christmas morning was a terrible morning.</sentence><sentence id="1138"><span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>...I don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the Slovak minister.</sentence><sentence id="1139"><span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> had been annexed by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was independent and so they had a diplomatic representative in <span

remember...but anyhow with, together with the attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the Legation.</sentence><sentence id="1141">We found him.</sentence><sentence id="1142">He was dead, in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> before the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1143">The Nazis had killed him because they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="1144">When I returned they wanted to take attorney Fakash away from me.</sentence><sentence id="1145">They wanted him to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and if he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, that was the end.</sentence><sentence id="1146">I was able to bring him back to the <span

will be escorted by the police forces.</sentence><sentence id="1149">I will go alone and you remain here because your life is in danger.</sentence><sentence id="1150">So I...the days...that's how the days passed after Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="1151">By New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="1152">We even danced...sure...we danced in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1153">We even brought out some bottles of Spanish wine.</sentence><sentence id="1154">There were hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Spanish wine from , bottles of wine from these areas in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> which is precious wine.</sentence><sentence id="1155">I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1156">And they danced.</sentence><sentence id="1157">They even danced.</sentence><sentence id="1158">I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think he was a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1161">3 priest.</sentence><sentence id="1162">I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending to be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me since they did not come into the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1163">They came only for...in the last moment when we were asleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> together and that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them.</sentence><sentence id="1164">I, I always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact with them.</sentence><sentence id="1165">You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="1166">There was a Hungarian diplomat, , who had a wife and daughter...uh many people.</sentence><sentence id="1167">There was sixty or so people, and they even danced.</sentence><sentence id="1168">And then the situation began to get worse.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1169">So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was I...OK.</sentence><sentence id="1170">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> and take them to the old grand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and deport them.</sentence><sentence id="1171">I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and and kill all the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1172">This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing.</sentence><sentence id="1173">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door or the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above...you know how it is.</sentence><sentence id="1174">So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing <span class="DLF">Mussolini Square</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews?</sentence><sentence id="1175">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1176">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I I didn't...1 couldn't assume any more responsibilities.</sentence><sentence id="1177">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1178">He was the : was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1179">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January.</sentence><sentence id="1180">Probably the 8th.</sentence><sentence id="1181">Perhaps even in the night.</sentence><sentence id="1182">Who knows.</sentence><sentence id="1183">Anyway, it's not that important.</sentence><sentence id="1184">So he went there that day.</sentence><sentence id="1185">I went because I had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city hall Budapest</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1186">And I told them I'm going to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> first because I have an appointment.</sentence><sentence id="1187">My appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together.</sentence><sentence id="1188">The colonel uh who is</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1191">4 head of the gendarmerie, accompanied me to the <span class="BUILDING">minister's office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1192">It was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way.</sentence><sentence id="1193">He saw that everything was lost.</sentence><sentence id="1194">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself.</sentence><sentence id="1195">Sada (ph) was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1196">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole gendarmerie of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes.</sentence><sentence id="1197">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone.</sentence><sentence id="1198">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know...I even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, ___ people...anything to move him.</sentence><sentence id="1199">I even cried.</sentence><sentence id="1200">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1201">I, I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees.</sentence><sentence id="1202">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1203">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1204">It was for a certain Colonel .</sentence><sentence id="1205">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1206">They kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1207">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires.</sentence><sentence id="1208">The Spanish government never answered.</sentence><sentence id="1209">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night.</sentence><sentence id="1210">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams.</sentence><sentence id="1211">I understood naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to contact the Anglo-Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1212">We understood it late, but we understood it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1213">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all.</sentence><sentence id="1214">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="1215">I wasn't intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="1216">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want.</sentence><sentence id="1217">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1218">So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1222">5 government would do such a thing?</sentence><sentence id="1223">What friendly government?</sentence><sentence id="1224">If you are against us, you're the ones who are against us.</sentence><sentence id="1225">This is what we want.</sentence><sentence id="1226">We want to protect these Jews.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1227">You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends.</sentence><sentence id="1228">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want.</sentence><sentence id="1229">To sum it up he said, OK.</sentence><sentence id="1230">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment.</sentence><sentence id="1231">I said no.</sentence><sentence id="1232">AIl...everyone or nobody.</sentence><sentence id="1233">All of those in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> must remain where they are or all those in the common <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I repeated to him again and all the stories about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the Anglo-Americans uh who would come to bombard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1234">And so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way.</sentence><sentence id="1235">When I left the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I found Wallenberg and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that.</sentence><sentence id="1236">When you do <span class="NPIP">inside</span> I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've just come to.</sentence><sentence id="1237">Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for political asylum in the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you.</sentence><sentence id="1238">You go to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1239">I'll wait for you and I'm going to have to go find something in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and then I'll I'll meet you there at the <span

very picky, an old-timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister jy everything will fall apart.</sentence><sentence id="1284">If we send the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telegram</span> we'll save four or five days.</sentence><sentence id="1285">We'll gain four or five days because the

I went to to the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1301">I pretended to knock.</sentence><sentence id="1302">I went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and to see this Vice

and I heard that these two people entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the <span class="REGION">area</span> too, and I asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said the big man is Minister Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and the other is his

the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1308">We still had telephone communications with which I could control or check on the various <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, not directly because there were no phones in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> but there were Christians who lived uh in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or next to them, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and they had agreed to telephone to us if there was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or 5th or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="1309">I think she told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they remember more than I do.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1310">She called me and I went over there at three in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1311">Anyhow, ;</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1313">There wasn't...no...it wasn't just that time.</sentence><sentence id="1314">That happened many times, ten or fifteen times.</sentence><sentence id="1315">Almost every evening I had to get up and go because

security people, and they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag and the banner whenever I traveled with them.</sentence><sentence id="1323">But anyway this normally happened at night and I would go on foot because it was dangerous to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="1324">There weren't very many lights.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1325">But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's <span

had thrown himself out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> and you asked me how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1328">This is someone who had helped me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1329">It doesn't matter that he was a Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so I had contacts with him and there was a Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard.</sentence><sentence id="1330">If I asked him for something, he would do it for me.</sentence><sentence id="1331">You understand.</sentence><sentence id="1332">Now I had contacts with him.</sentence><sentence id="1333">I had contacts with everyone.</sentence><sentence id="1334">Whoever happened to be

could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the Legation was...at the very end of the <span class="DLF">street</span>...the <span class="DLF">street</span> was three hundred meters long, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tank</span> with the mouth of the cannon facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in telephone contact with the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because as I said there were always Christian friends who had telephones in nearing the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> who were called.</sentence><sentence id="1341">They saw something abnormal.</sentence><sentence id="1342">For example, that night they called...I don't know who they called.</sentence><sentence id="1343">After half an hour I arrived and I saw that they were about to take them away.</sentence><sentence id="1344">I stopped everything but unfortunately I arrived five minutes after a man threw himself out of a <span class="DLF">window</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span>.</sentence><sentence

covered the body.</sentence><sentence id="1348">And I thought it was a woman but in...it was a man.</sentence><sentence id="1349">And so on the 16th uh you arrived in my <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1473">A: I escaped on October 13th, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="1474">It wasn't an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1475">I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1476">Each person had his own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1477">We ate three times a day and then we had tea in the afternoon and they even gave us cigarettes, soap and toothpaste and even money.</sentence><sentence id="1478">And this was according to the Geneva Convention because I was aggregated to the Italian commercial delegation and therefore I had uh I was uh I could uh have diplomatic uh treatment.</sentence><sentence id="1479">Uh the 13th I left.</sentence><sentence id="1480">The 13th of October and I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> that evening and the next day I don't know what I did but on the 15th the armistice was proclaimed between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, Great Britain and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1481">This was an announcement, a terrible announcement because no one was prepared for it except a few people who, who knew questions of state and government.</sentence><sentence id="1482">I was surprised.</sentence><sentence id="1483">I was having lunch with an Italian lady who was of the Jewish faith and she was married to an Italian diplomat and we...she was speechless and I was surprised, and I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1484">So I, [hid because the TV was controlled by the Admiral government and everything else fell in the hands of the Nazis and of the Germans, Hungarian Nazis and the German army and their...and then I went to hide in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which belonged to a friend of mine, uh family friends in the and from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I went to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to hide because I didn't know where to go because from the first evening I slept in a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in who gave me the keys to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1485">The next day I discovered that the maid was a German, a , and she was pro- Nazi and therefore I didn't go back to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it seemed dangerous to me.</sentence><sentence id="1486">After a couple of days in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, I spent two more days in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1487">I was hidden by the <span class="REGION">land</span>...by the landlady in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I used to live once upon a time, but then I realized that the <span class="BUILDING">Ugandan Hotel</span> that I knew very well was being emptied because many German officers were leaving with their suitcases and I went to the keeper of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I asked him if he could give me a</sentence><sentence id="1489">1 <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he said give me a passport and I said I don't have any passport anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1490">I don't have any more documents and he said OK, for two days I'll give you a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then I...so I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And so therefore the next morning I decided to go to the Spanish Legation.</sentence><sentence id="1492">It was probably eight in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1493">I went there and on the way, on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and I was on foot, on<span class="DLF">__ Street</span> which is a big <span class="DLF">street</span>, I saw that some Hungarian Nazis were chasing a child who was probably seven or eight years old.</sentence><sentence id="1494">They reached him and one of them shot the child in the back of the head.</sentence><sentence id="1495">I was quite struck by this naturally and I asked a passerby why, what did that child do?</sentence><sentence id="1496">Who is he?</sentence><sentence id="1497">And he said he's Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1498">From the roofs of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, however, there were some Jews who were shooting against the Nazis from the <span class="BUILDING">rooftop houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1499">But anyway I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> andI found ___ who gave me a passport and I...he said come tomorrow with two photos, and I had two in my pocket which I pulled out, and I gave them to him and then he gave me the passport.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And he also gave me a letter from the Minister of Interior which said that the Spanish government two years earlier had granted me their citizenship because I had fought in the civil war and also, the letter also said...and that I had asked for a citizenship and the letter said that they were not able to locate me and that they now found me and I had to assume citizenship, Spanish citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="1501">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION So we were...with this letter 1 went together with the legal attache..we went to the Minister of Interior where I changed citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="1502">I canceled the Italian one and I assumed Spanish citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="1503">When I returned to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> that early morning, it was probably eight or nine a.m., and it's strange that that morning Sanspritz (ph) got up at eight a.m., but these were very difficult times and people didn't always go to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1504">I saw...thank you...that there was a lot of confusion around, surrounding the Legation at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and that many of these people who were there had were wearing the David Star, Star of David, and I asked the legal attache what was happening and he said that these were people who are asking for our protection, protection from the Spanish government but right now we're in difficulty because the only Christian legation is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1505">And therefore it's impossible to organize an external protection and it's it doesn't make any sense to give them protection letters but I said if I can be of help, then I...maybe I can do something, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> and I told him I'm available if you need me, and he said yes.</sentence><sentence id="1506">Sanspritz said yes but I can't pay you because we don't have any funds to pay you with and I said I'm not interested because I have enough money to survive on my own.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And so I started immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1508">I started working immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1509">The first few hours I must tell the truth....I didn't know what to do and I didn't know where to start, but then after speaking with uh the attorney Fakash (ph) who was the attorney and also with the Chancellor and with other people who were there who were all Jews, Fakash, the Chancellor, her son and all of the refugees and so | realized what could be done.</sentence><sentence id="1510">The first thing was to try to get back about three hundred people who had been protected by <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1511">They had about three hundred, only three hundred at that time because the Hungarian government had said three hundred, and Sanspritz accepted this decision on behalf of the Spanish government and this is something that I didn't, didn't accept immediately at first so those first two or three days my job was to try to find those who had been protected, of the three hundred protected.</sentence><sentence id="1512">Of the three hundred I was able to get a hundred and fifty back and I found them at the uh <span class="BUILDING">Merchandise Depot</span>, at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and also by going to the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and say <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and those who had a Spanish ID we were able to bring them back.</sentence><sentence id="1513">It seems to me we had rented two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> but</sentence><sentence id="1515">2 I don't remember now how many, or we brought them back with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or we reserved a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>... I don't really remember how that happened.</sentence><sentence id="1516">I was with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="1517">hada <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1518">So I started working.</sentence><sentence id="1519">I saved uh...after...oh he wants to know if you're going to edit it, edit this tape... ...So the episode at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>...you can take it from the other tape and put it together, piece it together... The first episode that struck me very much and which opened my eyes to what was happening and to how things were actually really were, at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> they were loading <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train cars</span> with Jews who were being deported because the Hungarian government said that it had an agreement publicly with the German government to give thirty million uh Jews who would go to work and then we understood that that wasn't true, that they were going to work.</sentence><sentence id="1520">They were people who were being deported and then we didn't know what would happen to them in the end, so much so that Eva Long's (ph) husband had volunteered to be a laborer.</sentence><sentence id="1521">He went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but on the trip between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and the <span class="DLF">border</span> he understood...I don't know how...but he understood that it was a trick and so he jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1522">And he came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to .</sentence><sentence id="1523">I don't think that that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> existed yet but anyway he came to one of the <span class="BUILDING">Spanish houses</span>, so...this episode of the two twins...at a certain point there was a column which was going and we were looking to see if anybody was there with Spanish letters, and I saw two twins, two kids of eleven or twelve years old.</sentence><sentence id="1524">They were very handsome kids, nice kids and they were identical and the more I saw the more | told myself how is it possible that I, I let them go, and so I told these kids, you see that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1525">Get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1526">Run to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1527">Get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1528">Close the <span class="DLF">door</span> and then the chauffeur will know what he has to do.</sentence><sentence id="1529">Maybe you would like to hear from me how I could communicate with these people.</sentence><sentence id="1530">At the time I spoke German, French, Spanish, but I could explain myself, I could express myself in Hungarian for a little bit and perhaps I spoke Hungarian with these children, but anyhow these kids went.</sentence><sentence id="1531">One Gestapo major came to and he wanted the kids back, and I said no.</sentence><sentence id="1532">They were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1533">It's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Spanish car</span> and it had a Spanish uh flag and a license plate, diplomatic license plates and therefore the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was extra(c)territorial property.</sentence><sentence id="1534">He insisted.</sentence><sentence id="1535">He took out his gun and then so forth, and next, Wallenberg was next to me and Wallenberg said...told the major, the German major, look...this man represents <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1536">You can't...you can't commit any violent acts.</sentence><sentence id="1537">He said look.</sentence><sentence id="1538">He's getting in the way of my work, and instinctively I replied that you call this work.</sentence><sentence id="1539">That's what I asked him.</sentence><sentence id="1540">And so he got even more angry.</sentence><sentence id="1541">He wanted the kids back.</sentence><sentence id="1542">And L...at that point I saw the situation getting really bad.</sentence><sentence id="1543">I thought my God, this man is crazy.</sentence><sentence id="1544">He could shoot us.</sentence><sentence id="1545">He had a big gun, a Mauthauser (ph), a big, big gun, but at that point...we were all yelling.</sentence><sentence id="1546">I was screaming.</sentence><sentence id="1547">Wallenberg, the Spaniard...sorry...the Portuguese, the Swiss, the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span>...everyone intervened in the discussion.</sentence><sentence id="1548">There were many loud voices at the same time and so this colonel, a colonel came, an SS colonel came...of the Gestapo...sorry...came to see what was happening and he asked the major what was happening and the major explained it to him, and so he said now let it be...their time will come too for the kids.</sentence><sentence id="1549">And so they left.</sentence><sentence id="1550">And then I brought these <span class="BUILDING">kids home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1551">I brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and I was surprised to see that they were really a boy and a girl who when they were fully dressed you couldn't tell and they...it was a boy and a girl and they were perfectly identical.</sentence><sentence id="1552">The same height, the same face...everything, everything was identical.</sentence><sentence id="1553">This is an episode that struck me which, which along with the other episode of the child who was killed on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, these two episodes made me reflect very much.</sentence><sentence id="1554">It's not that...at the time I really wasn't fully aware of the situation.</sentence><sentence id="1555">From the end of March to October 13th, I was not...I had been interned away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>...I continued my work.</sentence><sentence id="1556">I stopped looking for the three hundred people because I got one hundred and fifty back and it seemed have understood that</sentence><sentence id="1558">3 there was nothing more that could be done and so I started to organize the protection network.</sentence><sentence id="1559">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1560">I don't remember where it was. (</sentence><sentence id="1561">Technical conversation) I don't remember which one it was but we did have one <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1562">Maybe two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> we had already.</sentence><sentence id="1563">Maybe they were _ wherever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long</span> was...yes, it's perhaps...but anyway that's not important.</sentence><sentence id="1564">I started organizing by issuing hundreds of letters immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1565">Letters of protection and I would...I would let these people come in.</sentence><sentence id="1566">We would go to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and type up these letters.</sentence><sentence id="1567">Sanspritz didn't know anything because we used his signature pad.</sentence><sentence id="1568">He didn't know how many.</sentence><sentence id="1569">His job was to keep relations with the Foreign Affairs Minister.</sentence><sentence id="1570">So we issued I think more than two thousand five hundred protection...letters of protection in the month of...at the end of October and November.</sentence><sentence id="1571">To be more specific...1 couldn't be more specific than that.</sentence><sentence id="1572">I think we maybe reached three thousand, more or less.</sentence><sentence id="1573">It wasn't very easy.</sentence><sentence id="1574">Not only...it wasn't sufficient to issue a letter of protection and to escort these people to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they had to be escorted to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> after all.</sentence><sentence id="1575">I had some people who were willing to accompany these people with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> uh as the letters of protection were issued.</sentence><sentence id="1576">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> who were available and who shuttled back and forth between the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where they were going to live and they would go back and forth continuously and therefore and so we had to uh provide for everything.</sentence><sentence id="1577">We had to get them settled.</sentence><sentence id="1578">Normally these <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> that we would take, we had to pay the rent, but these are details that are of no importance and perhaps we didn't even pay the rent.</sentence><sentence id="1579">We also had to feed these people and we had to be careful that the Nazis wouldn't go to take them because they did do that.</sentence><sentence id="1580">They did especially they would try to attack those <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Swiss houses</span> because they had a, a system of protection which was not correct.</sentence><sentence id="1581">In other words, they had given, both of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> had a mixed committee, Jewish and Christian committee which was responsible for issuing letters of protection.</sentence><sentence id="1582">To sum it up these letters were being sold.</sentence><sentence id="1583">The authorities and particularly the Nazis found out about this and so therefore every day they, they would come and take uh raid the Swiss and the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1584">I think that as far as I know <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> issued forty million letters of protection and in its <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> it had maybe three or four thousand people because they would come in the afternoon and the next day there would be raids, and this is not something that I just heard.</sentence><sentence id="1585">They weren't rumors.</sentence><sentence id="1586">I saw them with my very own eyes and with Wallenberg I asked him why did you, why do you do that kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1587">That's not correct.</sentence><sentence id="1588">These letters are being sold and everyone knows about it.</sentence><sentence id="1589">The authorities know about it.</sentence><sentence id="1590">Anyway, we had to protect to prevent that these people be taken.</sentence><sentence id="1591">We had to protect them.</sentence><sentence id="1592">With one excuse or the other the Nazi police...not the regular police...the regular police would intervene when they had orders but there was also various police forces, Nazi police forces in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> of representing various factions which were ferocious.</sentence><sentence id="1593">They killed.</sentence><sentence id="1594">They uh they robbed and that was their goal, and we had to protect the those who were being protected from themselves because these, these people sometimes lacked common sense.</sentence><sentence id="1595">Sometimes it was useless.</sentence><sentence id="1596">It wasn't enough to tell them don't go out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because if you go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they'll take, they take you away.</sentence><sentence id="1597">They put you in the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and the Nazis may even kill you, and to...that will give us more work to do because we'll have to come and get you and find you and this happened many times.</sentence><sentence id="1598">They would go and take a walk to go find their girlfriend, to go find their boyfriend...all these things.</sentence><sentence id="1599">Or for whatever reasons, their own reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1600">I even created the committees in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with three members and their job was to be concerned about hygiene, discipline, order, and to prevent people from leaving the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and going on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1601">They had to remain <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because there they were safe.</sentence><sentence id="1602">If they left the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, they were no longer safe.</sentence><sentence id="1603">They would take their stars off and they would go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there would be Nazis there who would ask them for their papers</sentence><sentence id="1605">4 and what papers could they show.</sentence><sentence id="1606">They didn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="1607">If they did, it would be clear that they were Jews and therefore...yeah...you can understand what happened then.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And so we had to find uh food for them and security besides watching.</sentence><sentence id="1609">We were pretty lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1610">It was a continuous job because we had to travel throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> continuously to show the flag, to show that we were present and continuously...I went at least twice a day and daringly, I went daringly on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and little by little with the with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>...I would go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and so the people could see the, the uh flag, so the people could see that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was guarding them, and therefore and so with time, with the passage of weeks, new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were organized.</sentence><sentence id="1611">We tried with a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> too but it was but it failed.</sentence><sentence id="1612">The...it was my idea but it was a bad idea.</sentence><sentence id="1613">It didn't go well.</sentence><sentence id="1614">So weeks went on.</sentence><sentence id="1615">Months went by...sorry...weeks went on and at the end of November we were working continuously and the work with...the contacts with the authorities...I didn't, I didn't think that you didn't need to have contacts with the authorities.</sentence><sentence id="1616">Quite the contrary.</sentence><sentence id="1617">I made as many contacts as possible.</sentence><sentence id="1618">I...one day for example I took ...1 don't know what that is...I took twenty-five thousand _ to the secretary of the minister who was very... ..oh, money.</sentence><sentence id="1619">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1620">This is money that he brought to the Hungarian uh refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpetia</span> and the refugees...and this is money for the children and he was very thankful and every time, every time I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where he...I went up to see him to say hello to him and this gave me the possibility to ask him information all the time, how it was going at the Foreign Affairs Ministry, for example.</sentence><sentence id="1621">For example, since Fritz didn't want to go to the Ministry, since Fritz (ph) never left the Legation to visit a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...he never visited any of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1622">He didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="1623">He wasn't interested even in how many signatures were used with his signature pad because he was a diplomat and he had uh limited vision.</sentence><sentence id="1624">He was an old- timer diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="1625">This is a very...what he did was very serious and uh correct but it would have been a good thing in times of peace and in normal times when the war was not ideological as it had become, when there was no persecution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1626">Not only of Jews but also the uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> there were many uh...uh they had orchestras.</sentence><sentence id="1627">They played the violins and they had <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and they played the orchestras and with the violins and their famous people...in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> (ph)... .</sentence><sentence id="1628">I'm sorry...I can't find the word...you know...these traveling homeless kind of people...oh...uh... they, they dress in flashy costumes...(gypsies)...gypsies, gypsies....thank you.</sentence><sentence id="1629">Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="1630">Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="1631">Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="1632">I couldn't find the word...sorry...OK. (</sentence><sentence id="1633">Pause) In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> on...day and night I went to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> and I had meals and in the evenings they had orchestras.</sentence><sentence id="1634">They were played by the gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="1635">And there was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Square</span>, where there was a good orchestra and there were a couple of good violinists.</sentence><sentence id="1636">One day they disappeared, in January of "42 I think it was.</sentence><sentence id="1637">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1638">January of 1942 they disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1639">I asked the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, what happened to the orchestra, the band.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And he said well...at first he didn't really want to answer.</sentence><sentence id="1641">He was reticent, and then he said the Germans took them off, because they are of an inferior race.</sentence><sentence id="1642">So they persecuted uh Jews, gypsies, and in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were many of them, and the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="1643">Not only uh Jewish Poles but the citizens too, and this is something that I saw.</sentence><sentence id="1644">This is not something that I just heard.</sentence><sentence id="1645">I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="1646">So, so we...this is how we worked, issuing these letters of protection and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> left.</sentence><sentence id="1647">I don't remember if he left the 30th of November or December Ist.</sentence><sentence id="1648">Uh it seems...I think that the ambassador, Spanish ambassador told me November 30th.</sentence><sentence id="1649">He told me November 30th, but I don't know if he's sure about this or not.</sentence><sentence id="1650">Anyhow, he...Sanspritz left and that morning there was a reaction on behalf of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1651">I found myself that morning, early in the morning I was called...six in the morning...and I don't remember who called me but they called me from the Legation to tell me that Sanspritz had left and so I got up and I, I visited the</sentence><sentence id="1653">5 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> thinking what do I do now?</sentence><sentence id="1654">What is the situation?</sentence><sentence id="1655">And in a certain sense the Nazis helped because by...when I went in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Street, Number 25, where the child was in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...he reminded me of some details the other day when I saw him for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="1656">He recalled some details that I didn't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1657">I saw besides...speaking of he exaggerates when I say that I uh yelled to the Nazis and said get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="1658">He exaggerates.</sentence><sentence id="1659">As a child, he thought that that's what I did but it wasn't quite like that, but anyhow that's how he saw it.</sentence><sentence id="1660">That's his mentality.</sentence><sentence id="1661">More or less that's how it was, but I wasn't screaming.</sentence><sentence id="1662">I wasn't yelling.</sentence><sentence id="1663">So I saw...I entered this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I said, what is happening here.</sentence><sentence id="1664">They were...they told us oh they want to take us away.</sentence><sentence id="1665">The police want to deport us.</sentence><sentence id="1666">And sure enough the regular police was there.</sentence><sentence id="1667">Not the Nazis, the regular police was there which was commanded by a lieutenant, and I asked this lieutenant, what do you want.</sentence><sentence id="1668">I've got to take everyone away.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And I closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in front of him.</sentence><sentence id="1670">I locked it, and I said look, no one is leaving.</sentence><sentence id="1671">The Spanish flag is here.</sentence><sentence id="1672">The Spanish emblem is here.</sentence><sentence id="1673">This...we consider this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> extra-territorial property.</sentence><sentence id="1674">It wasn't legal.</sentence><sentence id="1675">It wasn't right, but what governs such governments, you could just say...you could make up things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1676">It couldn't have been an extra-territorial house.</sentence><sentence id="1677">You needed special permission from the government.</sentence><sentence id="1678">The government had not given any special permission to do that, and so we discussed and we reached an agreement that he would postpone the...and together we would go to the <span class="DLF">park</span>, in the center of the <span class="DLF">park</span>, where there was a committee composed of various police forces, the Nazi party, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, the Interior Minister and I don't know who else...seven or eight people.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And I went there to speak with these people and I spoke with energy and with boldness because if I went there with my hat in hand and I said hey, they would say hey, this guy doesn't know what he's doing.</sentence><sentence id="1680">You had to assert yourself, especially with the Hungarians because these people are, are tough people and you had to be just as tough, and he said...I asked him what's happening, why do you want to take these uh people away.</sentence><sentence id="1681">He said because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> fled.</sentence><sentence id="1682">Who said that he fled?</sentence><sentence id="1683"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> took a trip.</sentence><sentence id="1684">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> where he is going to meet Spanish, Italian, French, German and Swiss diplomats to discuss the situation, but then he is coming back.</sentence><sentence id="1685">But in the meantime I am his...the legal representative of the Spanish government and charge d'affaires and I showed him my passport and my diplomatic pass and so the Foreign Affairs Minister representative said yes, this man is uh right what he said, so that's the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="1686">The only thing is that uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> really did leave.</sentence><sentence id="1687">He did flee, and he didn't have any intentions of coming back.</sentence><sentence id="1688">So much so that he didn't even tell me that he was leaving.</sentence><sentence id="1689">He didn't tell me anything.</sentence><sentence id="1690">Nothing at all.</sentence><sentence id="1691">He left.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And I learned about it when he was already at the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1693">He left at four or five in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1694">Anyway, but that's not important.</sentence><sentence id="1695">Perhaps it was a good thing.</sentence><sentence id="1696">It was a good thing, because the Nazis uh had invaded that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it gave me the opportunity to present myself as the successor to the man who they thought had escaped, so the representative of the Foreign Affairs Ministry said OK.</sentence><sentence id="1697">You're right.</sentence><sentence id="1698">The situation is legal.</sentence><sentence id="1699">Uh and I said look, there's a flag at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1700">There's a flag at all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> too, and he said...we had an agreement that after two or three days I would go to the Foreign Affairs Minister Ministry to clarify the Spanish position and in fact this is what happened, but when I went back to the Legation, I found that the Swedish Danielson (ph) Minister who was Wallenberg's boss had been to the Legation.</sentence><sentence id="1701">Danielson wanted to get some money...some Swiss francs.</sentence><sentence id="1702">They're about seventeen thousand Swiss francs which were in a Swiss uh Spanish Legation and I protested at...this is___ who is the Chancellor, and I said what do we do now.</sentence><sentence id="1703">We still hadsome__, some money left and not very much.</sentence><sentence id="1704">She didn't know what to do and she said that he said that he would send a secretary every morning, a Swedish secretary to see that everything was uh alright, and I said no, please, don't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1707">6 called Minister Danielson.</sentence><sentence id="1708">I begged him not to send anyone and that and that I would go and see him later on to explain the situation and I'm I went probably the next day or so, because if <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> uh protected the interest of the Spanish Legation, that meant that the interest of the Spanish Legation would no longer exist.</sentence><sentence id="1709">So we continued to work. .</sentence><sentence id="1710">The situation in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> came back to normal and while I was there in the <span class="DLF">park</span> I saw that there was a column of Jews that were being deported and I saw that someone was waving and so I went to see and I saw that these were some of the people protected from another <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of the same <span class="DLF">street</span>, the_<span class="DLF">__ Street</span>, of Number 33 which was very close, and so I made them give me back.</sentence><sentence id="1711">The situation in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was probably, was pretty normal and peaceful.</sentence><sentence id="1712">I don't know what those questions refer to. (</sentence><sentence id="1713">He hasn't understood the question.)</sentence><sentence id="1714">There were...you mean...are you referring to the quantity of people who were there, the sleeping conditions, the eating conditions...what are you referring to? .</sentence><sentence id="1715">In during December, the first ten days of December, we took some other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>...the last two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, it seems to me.</sentence><sentence id="1716">But the...from a point of view of the living conditions it was a very difficult situation and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, there were five hundred people. ____</sentence><sentence id="1717">told me that they slept on the <span class="DLF">steps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1718">I don't remember exactly even though there was a committee that held the list of all the people who arrived every day, but I don't remember how many there were exactly, because...1 must step forward here.</sentence><sentence id="1719">The morning that the Russians arrived, I burnt everything, even the lists of those who were protected because you never know.</sentence><sentence id="1720">If they fall in the hands of the Russians or the GPU...you don't know how they could have interpreted this fact, so we destroyed everything.</sentence><sentence id="1721">The Chancellor didn't want to.</sentence><sentence id="1722">She wanted to save a few things, and I said no.</sentence><sentence id="1723">Everything will be destroyed because nothing shall be left in the hands of the Russians because the Russians, the same day entered the Legation as I expected, had predicted.</sentence><sentence id="1724">And then they uh then they burnt it...they damaged it but I left.</sentence><sentence id="1725">The situation was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1726">As far as living conditions it was also difficult for the food.</sentence><sentence id="1727">It was difficult for the hygienic conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1728">It was difficult to find medicines.</sentence><sentence id="1729">There was a difficult time, for example, because they had tried to close the water supply in some of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1730">The Nazis had tried to do this and so I protested with vigor.</sentence><sentence id="1731">I went to the police commander and I demanded that the water be returned.</sentence><sentence id="1732">These things cannot be done because if there is a protection, then these people must have the necessary elements to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1733">If there is no water, I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1734">With five hundred people and, and if it were sixty or seventy...I don't know how, what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1735">And then there was the problem of food.</sentence><sentence id="1736">We had to feed these people.</sentence><sentence id="1737">At a certain point there was no more money left from the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>...this was Hungarian money in the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1738">I spent some of my money that I had in my pockets but I didn't have that much and you had to buy on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, and so I went to the Jewish Council, , and they gave me some money and then they didn't have any left either.</sentence><sentence id="1739">They, they were just in terrible conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1740">They had nothing left to eat themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1741">I must uh say that in the month of August, had fired the Nazi government and one of the first measures that was taken was that the star be no longer worn and all the racial laws were being dismantled and brought down, and so many people went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where they had lived.</sentence><sentence id="1742">Not everyone lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1743">Some of them lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1744">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpetia</span> (ph) for example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchovina</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1745">They were farmers.</sentence><sentence id="1746">The, the Jewish, the Jews of that <span class="REGION">area</span> were farmers, and so what did the Germans and the Nazis do.</sentence><sentence id="1747">They forced uh these Jews from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and...those who had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>...and they concentrated them in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, which could support maybe two, three million people...not fifty or sixty...two or three thousand people, not fifty or sixty thousand people, and so there was this black, terrible hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1748">There was...there were infections.</sentence><sentence id="1749">There were diseases.</sentence><sentence id="1750">They was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1753">7 There was no electricity.</sentence><sentence id="1754">There, there was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1755">They had nothing to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1756">And so this uh Jewish Council also ran out of money and once it ran...once they ran out, I ran out too, and with what I had I could buy something from the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and specifically I had to be careful with...watch the children because we had two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> which were really not ours but one belonged to the International Red Cross I think and one belonged to the Swedish Red Cross and the Spanish Legation had been begged to protect, protect and to take care of these two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and here I must open a parenthesis because the truth is the truth after all.</sentence><sentence id="1757">On the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> I bought condensed milk with the symbol of the International Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1758">And we had uh...it was very expensive.</sentence><sentence id="1759">We had to pay for it dearly on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, but there were many children.</sentence><sentence id="1760">There were children in the two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> and there were children in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, the protected <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1761">And since the Jewish Council which whose name was &gt; , which means Jewish Council, since this uh Council didn't have any money left, wasn't giving any money any more, since I had nominated a committee for each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to maintain the discipline and hygiene and order and so forth, I gave...I charged these committees to spy uh financially, economically.</sentence><sentence id="1762">They said...they would tell me which people could give money.</sentence><sentence id="1763">And so I went to these people...not every day...and I said give me a thousand ___. _</sentence><sentence id="1764">You can give me five thousand, near five...according to their capabilities.</sentence><sentence id="1765">And these people gave me money.</sentence><sentence id="1766">But somebody would say, why.</sentence><sentence id="1767">Why should I give you money?</sentence><sentence id="1768">And I would say because you have the money.</sentence><sentence id="1769">We need the money.</sentence><sentence id="1770">I don't have any.</sentence><sentence id="1771">The Legation doesn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="1772">What...what will we use to buy food with.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And then we discovered thanks to the spying activities that the committee undertook that there were some families that had reserves of food that were bountiful and there was a time when we just couldn't find anything on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> anymore, and so I had these reserves, food stocks, taken that these families had.</sentence><sentence id="1774">And this food was distributed because I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1775">There would have been fights because hunger is hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1776">A mother who doesn't have milk or food for her child...uh she sees the child get weaker and weaker every day...she's capable of killing and she's right, don't you think?</sentence><sentence id="1777">And so therefore with these stories...uh these stories occurred day after day, week after week, and we finally come to the day of Christmas Eve, which was a terrible day.</sentence><sentence id="1780">8 Tape #2 ...because the Russians, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> considered themselves in a state of war.</sentence><sentence id="1781">Anyhow, I always kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1782">Yes...yes...it's started.</sentence><sentence id="1783">Uh Christmas Day I remember that I left.</sentence><sentence id="1784">On Christmas Eve, on Christmas Eve I left.</sentence><sentence id="1785">I spent uh...that evening and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1786">It was in late afternoon and I thought that I would eat there but when I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> I found that there were elements of the Hungarian army with machine guns and other arms and so forth, and they told me that it's not possible to pass through because the Russians are very close, three hundred, four hundred meters away, and I told them that I have to go.</sentence><sentence id="1787">I'm, I'ma diplomat and I have to go to the, all the people of the Spanish Legation, which was very close, a hundred meters from here, and they said OK, we'll give you fifteen minutes and then you have to come back.</sentence><sentence id="1788">Otherwise it's uh your business.</sentence><sentence id="1789">I said OK.</sentence><sentence id="1790">So I went and I found that everything was topsy-turvy.</sentence><sentence id="1791">We had sixty refugees in the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and, and I understood that I didn't have time to have lunch there, that I had to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1792">They, they had made a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Christmas tree</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="1793">It was big because they had...they cut it down from the <span class="DLF">park</span> and it was six or seven meters high and you would enter the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and you would go down to the second...the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and it was all...it was a Christmas tree that was, that took up two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and was full of presents and I looked at the Christmas tree and I didn't even take my presents, because I said if I take my stuff, I am letting them know that the Russians are here, that there's going to be some fighting here and that we don't know what the Germans would have done and so forth and so I just said goodbye to everyone and I left.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1795">I was...didn't go back to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> because the next day it was burnt by a German grenade.</sentence><sentence id="1796">That evening, which was Christmas Eve, which is a holiday in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> too...it's...there's a big supper on Christmas Eve and I had been invited to lunch at the <span class="BUILDING">__ Hotel</span> by the Secretary of the Nazi Party, the Hungarian Nazi Party, and I feared that with this invitation he wanted to ask me to pay for the Spanish passports.</sentence><sentence id="1797">They say...the Hungarian newspapers said that I gave the Spanish passports to them.</sentence><sentence id="1798">That's now true.</sentence><sentence id="1799">It's not true.</sentence><sentence id="1800">If they had asked it from me, I don't know what I would have done.</sentence><sentence id="1801">I would have judged...assessed the situation at the time and I would have uh dealt and I would have...uh practically I would have sold the passports in exchange for guarantees for security for the protected people.</sentence><sentence id="1802">So we lunched together and we spoke about everything except politics.</sentence><sentence id="1803">We joked around, and at a certain point we had finished our lunch and a courier arrived which gave him, gave the minister something...just like in the movies.</sentence><sentence id="1804">And I think that this...on this piece of paper there was written that he had to leave and in fact he told me...look, I'm sorry but I have to leave and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1805">So we left.</sentence><sentence id="1806">And I was happy because he didn't ask me anything.</sentence><sentence id="1807">He didn't...he didn't ask anything about the passport, which was a delicate question to hand over a passport.</sentence><sentence id="1808">Yes, I did have passports to give, but if, if the question became known and the Spanish government found out that that the passport had been given to a Nazi minister, the Spanish government undoubtedly would have reacted, and they undoubtedly would have said no, we uh do not authorize this.</sentence><sentence id="1809">He's not authorized to give out passports, so I was glad that he didn't ask me anything.</sentence><sentence id="1810">Even though there are Hungarian newspapers that say that I gave uh passports to Nazi ministers, that's not true.</sentence><sentence id="1811">In fact, during the trials they didn't bring this up, so I was alone because I didn't even want an escort that evening.</sentence><sentence id="1812">I said I was going to go to dinner that evening and he would...and I just need someone to take me to some...to the Legation or to my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and that's all, because I had many <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I could go and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1813">Ata certain point, I was stopped by a group of Hungarian Nazis, Nazis, who asked me to see my passport and they said that this passport and diplomatic pass are no longer</sentence><sentence id="1815">9 valid.</sentence><sentence id="1816">And during this conversation I saw on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> a uh army elements, a pa...army patrol, and so I called them and the patrol came and it was commanded by a lieutenant who commanded thirty men or so, and I said look, these people want to arrest me and this is my name.</sentence><sentence id="1817">These are my documents and papers and so they said no, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1818">You can't touch this man.</sentence><sentence id="1819">He's a diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="1820">He represents <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and so he sent them away, and so they escorted me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1821">And I decided that I would go spend the night in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in uh ,in <span class="DLF">Street, Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1822">I invited this lieutenant to come and have a drink with me and he told me, declared to me that they were about to close...they were about to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and there was only one <span class="DLF">street</span> open left, and that's why I understood that the minister who had been in such a hurry to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1823">And so the next morning I tried to get in touch with the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>, because I had left two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there and I needed those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1824">One belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanspritz</span> and another had been lent to me that morning by an Italian citizen because the only two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> that I had in the Legation were not working, and so he lent me this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the next day the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was burnt in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1825">The whole <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> was destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="1826">Nothing was left.</sentence><sentence id="1827">Of my stuff, one girl saved five handkerchiefs that she had wanted to save me, but she didn't want to hang them

came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the last minute before the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> burnt and she uh got the box with the handkerchiefs and after three months, she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to give me the handkerchiefs.</sentence><sentence id="1829">That morning...that Christmas morning was a terrible morning.</sentence><sentence id="1830"><span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>...I don't know for what reasons...wanted uh cared for the Slovak minister.</sentence><sentence id="1831"><span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> had been annexed by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was independent and so they had a diplomatic representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1832">This diplomatic representative who had contacts with the Spaniards... don't know how...I don't remember...but anyhow with, together with the attorney Fakash went to look for him to bring him to the Legation.</sentence><sentence id="1833">We found him.</sentence><sentence id="1834">He was dead, in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> before the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1835">The Nazis had killed him because they had discovered that he was anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="1836">When I returned they wanted to take attorney Fakash away from me.</sentence><sentence id="1837">They wanted him to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and if he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, that was the end.</sentence><sentence id="1838">I was able to bring him back to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> and I told him you're not to leave this <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1839">I will go alone.</sentence><sentence id="1840">I will be escorted by the police forces.</sentence><sentence id="1841">I will go alone and you remain here because your life is in danger.</sentence><sentence id="1842">So I...the days...that's how the days passed after Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="1843">By New Year's Eve it was calm, especially in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="1844">We even danced...sure...we danced in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1845">We even brought out some bottles of Spanish wine.</sentence><sentence id="1846">There were hundreds and hundreds of Spanish, precious Spanish wine from , bottles of wine from these areas in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> which is precious wine.</sentence><sentence id="1847">I liked it anyhow and I used to drink it all the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1848">And they danced.</sentence><sentence id="1849">They even danced.</sentence><sentence id="1850">I was happy because these people who were in hiding...and they were all Jews except for one who said he was a priest, but I don't think he was a priest.</sentence><sentence id="1851">I think that he was a priest who was pretending...uh a Jew who was pretending to be a priest I think, but I never saw him again these are not details that really interested me since they did not come into the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1852">They came only for...in the last moment when we were asleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> together and that's when we had this party and that's when I saw them.</sentence><sentence id="1853">II always thought...I'm actually glad that I didn't have any contact with them.</sentence><sentence id="1854">You know, we'd just say hello and good evening and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="1855">There was a Hungarian diplomat, , who had a wife and daughter...uh many people.</sentence><sentence id="1856">There was sixty or so people, and they even danced.</sentence><sentence id="1857">And then the situation began to get worse.</sentence><sentence id="1858">So we still continued to issue those letters of protection because the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis...not Germans, Hungarian Nazis...when I speak of Nazis I always refer to the Hungarian Nazis, the Milash (ph)...so...what did I want to say...where was I...where was I...OK.</sentence><sentence id="1859">The first few days of January we heard some rumors according to which it</sentence><sentence id="1861">0 seemed that they wanted to take away all of the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> and take them to the old grand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and deport them.</sentence><sentence id="1862">I didn't believe in such a thing because they were saying that Minister who was in charge of the civilians and military for the seized (ph) capital, they were saying that he was going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and ,and kill all the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1863">This would have been the final Hungarian solution and I didn't believe in such a thing.</sentence><sentence id="1864">In the meantime new letters were being issued, not very many but there was always someone who felt threatened because they had inspected the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door or the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above...you know how it is.</sentence><sentence id="1865">So one day uh fourth...on the fourth or fifth or the sixth of January...I don't remember exactly...probably the fifth or the sixth of January, I was crossing <span class="DLF">Mussolini Square</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> which were very nearby and I saw a column of Jews passing by and so I asked, who are these Jews?</sentence><sentence id="1866">And they say, these are Jews, uh Portuguese Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1867">That night, during that during the night the Portuguese minister had sent an employee of his to ask me orally to assume the responsibility for the Portuguese Legation and I told him no, that if there is something, if there is something...if he can come and explain to me, then we can come to an agreement, but as it stands I, I didn't... couldn't assume any more responsibilities.</sentence><sentence id="1868">I'd had enough of my own, and so I saw that they took away all those Portuguese Jews and so I understood that that had already, man had already abandoned everything or he was about to abandon everything because he was the Portuguese minister but he was a Hungarian citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1869">He was the deg was his name, but he was a Hungarian citizen, but he was acting as Portuguese minister and therefore that man said he had abandoned everything, that he was stepping back and that he considered uh that he couldn't do anything more.</sentence><sentence id="1870">So I wrote a letter to this minister and I...where I wrote that I had heard these rumors, that I didn't believe in them, that please to deny these rumors but he didn't respond and after two days I wrote him....actually no...I telephoned and I said that I was about to come to see him...that I would come see him the next day and I think that was January 8 or the 7th or the 8th of January.</sentence><sentence id="1871">Probably the 8th.</sentence><sentence id="1872">Perhaps even in the night.</sentence><sentence id="1873">Who knows.</sentence><sentence id="1874">Anyway, it's not that important.</sentence><sentence id="1875">So he went there that day.</sentence><sentence id="1876">I went because I had heard these rumors which were more and more prevalent and then I saw, when I saw the column of the Portuguese Jews I was struck and I went and I found in uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city hall Budapest</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, I found Wallenberg, the Swede, and who was Swiss.</sentence><sentence id="1877">And I told them I'm going to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> first because I have an appointment.</sentence><sentence id="1878">My appointment...it hadn't really been conferred to me that I had an appointment but uh and when I return from the appointment then we can all talk together.</sentence><sentence id="1879">The colonel uh who is head of the gendarmerie, accompanied me to the <span class="BUILDING">minister's office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1880">It was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and this colonel three days later killed himself by the way.</sentence><sentence id="1881">He saw that everything was lost.</sentence><sentence id="1882">He'd been compromised because of the Jewish question and so he killed himself.</sentence><sentence id="1883">Sada (ph) was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1884">Colonel Sada and he was the head of the whole gendarmerie of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time, so I went to this minister that I had seen, not known, but I had seen him in the past and very calmly he said yes.</sentence><sentence id="1885">He wanted to solve the Jewish question by killing everyone.</sentence><sentence id="1886">And so I started to say do you realize what's happening and do you realize what's going to happen, that the Hungarian people will have to suffer because you killed a hundred thousand people, and so finally I even...you know... even talked about the Myian (ph) civilization and everything that came to mind, people...anything to move him.</sentence><sentence id="1887">I even cried.</sentence><sentence id="1888">Uh but he was tough so I didn't know what to do anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1889">I I can't just leave the situation like this, I thought to myself, so I told him, look...if within forty-five hours the Spanish government does not receive from me a guarantee that all is calm and that the agreements between...the agreements with the Hungarian government have been respected because during the period between October, November and December we had</sentence><sentence id="1891">1 come to an agreement with the Foreign Affairs Minister and the Hungarian government...we had reached an agreement and received guarantees.</sentence><sentence id="1892">Not only that but the Hungarian government wanted to send a diplomatic representative to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> in order to, to tie diplomatic relations with the Anglo-Americans to see in, in, in view of the peace treaty, and logically the Spanish government who didn't wish to recognize the Nazi government, didn't want to hear anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1893">The, the uh credentials, the request for credentials...he's explaining uh this...what credentials are...logically I didn't transmit these letters of...this request for credentials to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1894">It was for a certain Colonel .</sentence><sentence id="1895">I didn't transmit them because if I did the Spanish government would probably say that that they that they didn't accept it because they didn't recognize the government while until then the government, the Spanish government kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1896">They kept quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1897">Also the Spanish uh Spanish ambassador last night told me that he saw in the archives many telegrams from the Hungarian government which asked the Spanish government if I was really the charge d'affaires.</sentence><sentence id="1898">The Spanish government never answered.</sentence><sentence id="1899">The Spanish ambassador told me that last night.</sentence><sentence id="1900">They never...the Spanish government never responded to these telegrams.</sentence><sentence id="1901">I understood naturally, slowly...I slowly understood why we had a preferential treatment with the Hungarian government and this was because they wanted to have diplomatic relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> to contact the Anglo-Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1902">We understood it late, but we understood it.</sentence><sentence id="1903">If we understood it immediately, maybe two months earlier because we're already talking about the beginning of November...had we understood it earlier, two months ago, we would have behaved differently and perhaps something more could have been done I think but uh we're not...we weren't that intelligent after all.</sentence><sentence id="1904">The Spanish ambassador told me not that...not everyone is intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="1905">I wasn't intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="1906">The other the other guy also wasn't intelligent so uh what do you want.</sentence><sentence id="1907">So I told him that if within forty-five hours the Spanish government doesn't get any guarantees that everything is proceeding with order the three thousand Hungarian citizens which are, who are in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> will be interned...actually there were really a hundred including the diplomats...and their goods will be seized and this, the Spanish government will...or ask the Brazilian government and the Paraguayan government to do the same with those Hungarian citizens who were in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1908">So this minister said a friendly government like the Spanish government would do such a thing?</sentence><sentence id="1909">What friendly government?</sentence><sentence id="1910">If you are against us, you're the ones who are against us.</sentence><sentence id="1911">This is what we want.</sentence><sentence id="1912">We want to protect these Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1913">You don't want to do it, so you are coming against our interests and against our policy and against our interests and our wishes, so how can you say that we are friends.</sentence><sentence id="1914">We're friends if you say, if you do what we want.</sentence><sentence id="1915">To sum it up he said, OK.</sentence><sentence id="1916">The Spaniards are, are excluded from the liquidation, will be excluded from the liquidation and so I said no, and I became uh demanding in that moment.</sentence><sentence id="1917">I said no.</sentence><sentence id="1918">All...everyone or nobody.</sentence><sentence id="1919">All of those in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> must remain where they are or all those in the common <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> must be, must have electricity and water, so forth again, because those people have to survive too because what would what would happen of the Hungarian people, so I repeated to him again and all the stories about vendettas, terrible vendettas and uh the Anglo(c)Americans uh who would come to bombard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1920">And so we agreed that everything would have uh occurred in that way.</sentence><sentence id="1921">When I left the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> I found Wallenberg and were still there, and I explained the situation to them and I said I was able to obtain this and that.</sentence><sentence id="1922">When you do <span class="NPIP">inside</span> I don't know what you can ask of this minister, but please don't uh do anything to undermine this agreement that we've just come to.</sentence><sentence id="1923">Otherwise nothing more...so Wallenberg asked me for political asylum in the Spanish Legation and I said fine, I'll wait for you.</sentence><sentence id="1924">You go to the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1925">I'll wait for you and I'm going to have to go find something in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and</sentence><sentence id="1927">2 then I'll, I'll meet you there at the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1928">He said no.</sentence><sentence id="1929">I will come with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="1930">I'll give you the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> because I know you need a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and I'll come.</sentence><sentence id="1931">I never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="1932">Never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="1933">I know that on the 18th he...on the morning of the 18th he wason<span class="DLF">__ Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1934">I know this for sure, and he had left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at ten in the morning to go I don't know where.</sentence><sentence id="1935">From then on he disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1936">Now since the since historians say that on the 16th he went to at the Russian command and that he was taken prisoner there.</sentence><sentence id="1937">I say that's not true because on the morning of the 18th he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in the on the _Sttreet.</sentence><sentence id="1938">means king.</sentence><sentence id="1939">I don't know really... saw him maybe a dozen times.</sentence><sentence id="1940">I spoke to him specifically during the meetings with diplomats.</sentence><sentence id="1941">I never saw him otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="1942">From the beginning of December, all the diplomats, mutual diplomats, had disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1943">He couldn't find any of them.</sentence><sentence id="1944">Wallenberg...when I saw Wallenberg at <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> on the meeting, the day that I met ,uhI'd seen him, besides that time, I'd seen him on December 22nd at the uh Papal Nuncio (ph) where he had signed a document uh to protest uh and this was in favor of women and I remember that he did not sign that document because he couldn't sign it because he was a secretary and Minister Danielson, his boss, was there.</sentence><sentence id="1945">The ambassador.</sentence><sentence id="1946">His, his boss wasn't there at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1947">Uh that morning during the meeting I told the Archbishop Angelo I would like to speak privately with you and so we went into another <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and so I told him look...I started speaking to him in Italian.</sentence><sentence id="1948">In the meetings we always spoke in French.</sentence><sentence id="1949">Uh I started speaking in Italian.</sentence><sentence id="1950">I said look, I'm not a Spaniard.</sentence><sentence id="1951">I'm Italian and I'm close to you because I'm, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Komo</span> (ph) and he had also been born close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Komo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1952">He said oh, you're...you're kidding.</sentence><sentence id="1953">You're joking.</sentence><sentence id="1954">I said no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1955">I'm not kidding.</sentence><sentence id="1956">This is the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1957">I tell you this because if something would ever happen to me, you...I want you to know this so that you can uh tell my relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1958">He told me, I remember, don't tell : was his secretary because that guy is very picky.</sentence><sentence id="1959">He can...he might become very angry, might cause trouble.</sentence><sentence id="1960">I said no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1961">I won't tell .</sentence><sentence id="1962">And his...practically this is where the story ends because after a few days...no, actually the next morning, Mr. , Mr.__ sent an employee to ask for telegrams to send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> because we didn't have a radio.</sentence><sentence id="1963">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> was under siege and it wasn't...we couldn't communicate with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1964">Normally you could telephone <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> telephoned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> via radio communicated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1965">But this...it was no longer possible to use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">phone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1966">And so I sent this employee to ask for a telegram which uh I asked him to send via radio radio because he had aradio.</sentence><sentence id="1967">Uh Mr. Fakash, Attorney Fakash who was an attorney who was very picky, an old- timer, uh told me that I shouldn't send the telegram and I told him look, if I don't send the telegram as soon as this employee goes back to Minister , everything will fall apart.</sentence><sentence id="1968">If we send the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telegram</span> we'll save four or five days.</sentence><sentence id="1969">We'll gain four or five days because the Spanish government will of course have to reflect on this before responding.</sentence><sentence id="1970">They're not going to respond immediately obviously.</sentence><sentence id="1971">The telegram will be send today.</sentence><sentence id="1972">I don't know if it'll arrive immediately in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span> and who will receive it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1973">It has to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> and this takes time.</sentence><sentence id="1974">I wrote to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1975">I wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1976">After two or three or four days the...Madrid sent its response thanking uh thanks and it said that it was sure that the Hungarian government would have respected the agreements and so forth and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1977">The employee came to deliver the telegram himself and he said that the minister was very satisfied with the telegram and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1978">And then one time something happened which is a little bit funny but at the same time it uh it's...I don't want to say fear but it gave me, made me a little bit anxious.</sentence><sentence id="1979">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Foreign Affairs Ministry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1980">This was at the end of December.</sentence><sentence id="1981">I think before Christmas I went to the Foreign Affairs Ministry and I entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">antechamber</span> where the secre...permanent secretary had his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1982">He was like a Vice Minister with whom I'd had contact.</sentence><sentence id="1983">His name was F</sentence><sentence id="1985">3 and I saw that there were two men seated on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> who were waiting and one of them I, I recognized.</sentence><sentence id="1986">He was the Chancellor of the Italian Legation, the Royal Italian Legation, and the other gentleman I didn't know who he was, so I very boldly...I had to very boldly salute them like this and instead of going to the secretary who sort of looked at me with surprise, I went to to the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1987">I pretended to knock.</sentence><sentence id="1988">I went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and to see this Vice Minister.</sentence><sentence id="1989">I did what I had to do and after four...after fifteen minutes or so I left.</sentence><sentence id="1990">I said goodbye to the young lady and I made a, a vague signal with my hand like this and I left.</sentence><sentence id="1991">But once I arrived in the in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> I really came back and I started to eaves...eavesdrop and I heard that these two people entered the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and entered the Vice Minister's office so I entered the <span class="REGION">area</span> too, and I asked Mrs...the young lady...and I said, oh I think I recognize these two men and she said the big man is Minister Gratanzi (ph) of the Social Republic of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and the other is his secretary.</sentence><sentence id="1992">He was the he was a fascist minister, the Social Republic...the Fascist Social Republic.</sentence><sentence id="1993">On the 16th...in the meantime between the...on the 13th it wasn't possible to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1994">We still had telephone communications with which I could control or check on the various <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, not directly because there were no phones in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> but there were Christians who lived uh in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or next to them, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and they had agreed to telephone to us if there was danger and for example with Eva Long (ph) on the evening of January 3rd or 4th or Sth or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="1995">I think she told me even...I think she even told me...anyway they, they remember more than I do.</sentence><sentence id="1996">She called me and I went over there at three in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1997">Anyhow... There wasn't...no...it wasn't just that time.</sentence><sentence id="1998">That happened many times, ten or fifteen times.</sentence><sentence id="1999">Almost every evening I had to get up and go because the Nazis wanted to come and take them away, to take the Jews away from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>. ...</sentence><sentence id="2000">speaking.</sentence><sentence id="2001">I told them that we had agreements with the Hungarian government and so forth and so on and in the meantime somebody well from my entourage...I always had an entourage.</sentence><sentence id="2002">I always had four police officers and two employees of the <span class="BUILDING">security office</span> and in reality I always traveled with two people but...two policemen and two public security people, and they never wanted to leave my side and when I left there were two policemen who left and the Legation too...I...I felt like I was a medieval cavalier with the flag and the banner whenever I traveled with them.</sentence><sentence id="2003">But anyway this normally happened at night and I would go on foot because it was dangerous to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="2004">There weren't very many lights.</sentence><sentence id="2005">But anyhow that night, that last night that I went to Eva Long in let's say Eva Long's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...I didn't know Eva Long at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2006">I met her only three years ago.</sentence><sentence id="2007">I...I arrived five minutes after a man had thrown himself out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> from the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> and you asked me how I, how could I prevent them from taking them away and I would tell them that we had agreements and then at the same time one of my escorts would go to a telephone and telephone the police commando and the Colonel would intervene.</sentence><sentence id="2008">This is someone who had helped me, because I had contacts with everyone, with Nazis, non-Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="2009">It doesn't matter that he was a Nazi who...he was a Nazi but he was useful so I had contacts with him and there was a Hungarian Nazi, a young guy with a beard.</sentence><sentence id="2010">If] asked him for something, he would do it for me.</sentence><sentence id="2011">You understand.</sentence><sentence id="2012">Now I had contacts with him.</sentence><sentence id="2013">I had contacts with everyone.</sentence><sentence id="2014">Whoever happened to be there, I had contacts with because that's how you had to operate.</sentence><sentence id="2015">Experience taught me that everyone can be useful.</sentence><sentence id="2016">There's some who do big favors and some who do smaller favors.</sentence><sentence id="2017">Some could intervene for this and some could intervene for that reason.</sentence><sentence id="2018">The Foreign Affairs Minister could intervene for that and the Interior Minister could intervene for this and the Nazi Party for another reason and so the last three days I couldn't leave because on the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> was...at the very end of the <span class="DLF">street</span>...the <span class="DLF">street</span> was three hundred</sentence><sentence id="2020">4 meters long, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tank</span> with the mouth of the cannon facing the <span class="DLF">street</span> which would shoot any time it saw a person and so who dared to leave and go on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2021">In order to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Legation</span> to the ___ Paraguayan Legation which was...you had to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and dash, make a dash to get to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2022">And as soon as you did the, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> would shoot and so you couldn't leave, but I was in telephone contact with
