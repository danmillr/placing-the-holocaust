<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: We really would like to stick with your story and what you experienced.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Well, this is what I experienced. (</sentence><sentence id="62">Oh, OK.)</sentence><sentence id="63">Uh, uh, I discussed uh, the World War I with some uh, with a gentleman that had uh, been in that, and he told me that uh, he felt that we weren't finished with the Germans, that the Nazi uh, the Nazi uh, that were coming in uh, in power, uh, that there was going to be a war, and he impressed on uh, on me this.</sentence><sentence id="64">Then uh, in 1939 I met my first, I had my first contact and inkling that there was uh, something happening over there.</sentence><sentence id="65">I was with a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> group and they sponsored a Jewish uh, family that came over, and I remember this this family...very brilliant people, and uh, wonderful people and they uh, they were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="66">This was a <span class="BUILDING">Congregational Church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Well, they came in and uh, we got acquainted with them, and I remember talking to uh, the daughter and she was telling me about how they were taking the Jewish people and putting them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and this was in 1938 or "39.</sentence><sentence id="68">And uh, we couldn't, we couldn't comprehend that that type of thing was happening.</sentence><sentence id="69">However, the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> did sponsor several Jewish people coming uh,...Jewish families coming over and uh, wouldn't it have been wonderful if we had of known then what actually was happening, but that my...the first inkling that I had that anything such as this happened.</sentence><sentence id="70">Now, getting back to uh, uh, getting back to uh, going into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I had several uh, instances where we we found uh, people who were uh, displaced people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and other uh, <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and uh, but not a not a lot of them.</sentence><sentence id="71">Apparently, as we moved on through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, these people were uh, were uh, carried back behind the <span class="DLF">German lines</span> and as a consequence, only those that may have hidden someplace uh, uh, were the ones that we saw.</sentence><sentence id="72">Uh, I do remember one time...uh, it was uh, not too long before uh, we hit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span> that uh, we went into a large uh, oh <span class="DLF">German farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">It was a...there was a baron that was that had an <span class="DLF">estate</span> and uh, he had virtually a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>, a small <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">Uh, we went into into this <span class="REGION">area</span> and uh, uh, there were a lot of uh, well, slave labors.</sentence><sentence id="75">Uh, uh, they were probably uh,...they were Polish, uh, possibly some Russians and there were some Italians there.</sentence><sentence id="76">Why there were Italians I don't know, but uh, uh, the baron uh, came out and asked me if I could do something about these horrible people that were uh, stealing all his food and we uh,....1 1 was a platoon commander at the time, and uh, so he invited me in for some wine, and so I uh, went over to my uh, sergeant and asked him to get uh, two of our people.</sentence><sentence id="77">One was of Polish uh, extraction and could speak Polish and German.</sentence><sentence id="78">The other was Italian.</sentence><sentence id="79">His name of Pecares (ph).</sentence><sentence id="80">Well uh, they went over and talked to these people while I went in to talk to the baron.</sentence><sentence id="81">Well, I went in there and he had these beau...these beautiful uh, arms, guns and uh, medieval type armament on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and then uh, he had apparently been a big game hunter.</sentence><sentence id="82">Uh, the uh, baron told me how horrible these people were and uh, uh, how the Germans were uh, being uh, victimized by them.</sentence><sentence id="83">Well, in talking to this man...he had uh, he had been an editor of a newspaper uh, somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and uh, in asking him about the Nazis, why of course he didn't know that all these things were happening.</sentence><sentence id="84">Uh, uh, and he pointed out that he had opened up his, part of his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">And he did.</sentence><sentence id="86">He had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="87">They were all uh, either wounded Germans or wounded civilians uh, that were in there.</sentence><sentence id="88">Uh, after uh, I had my glass of wine with him, I went back to talk to the uh, to the Polish and the Italian men.</sentence><sentence id="89">Well their story was quite interesting.</sentence><sentence id="90">These people were kept in virtual slavery in this in this <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and uh, they uh, uh, they weren't allowed to have religious services.</sentence><sentence id="91">They weren't allowed to marry.</sentence><sentence id="92">And one of the interesting things was uh, one of them told how they uh, if one, ifa man and a woman wanted to get together...incidentally they all lived in in communal uh, uh, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in effect...a man and woman wanted to get together and become man and wife, why they uh, stood and told each other that they uh, were were man and wife.</sentence><sentence id="93">There's of course no religious services, but to them that was a marriage.</sentence><sentence id="94">Uh, but uh, uh, these these people were hungry.</sentence><sentence id="95">They had nothing to eat, and the only food was what the baron had and so we told the baron that he was going to have to feed them and that we could do nothing about uh, them stealing, uh, well actually taking food, that uh, we were going to leave and that uh, uh, we we gave instructions to the people to be reasonable and fair and whatever happened after that I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="96">But this was one incident that we ran into uh, rather often in uh, to one degree or another.</sentence><sentence id="97">Uh, uh, it was amusing that uh, the baron was uh,,...of course, he knew nothing about what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="98">Uh, the same as uh, another <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there's a man that was an umbrella manufacturer, and he knew nothing...uh, we took over his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to stay...he knew nothing about the what the Nazis were doing, and he wasn't a Nazi, but in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we found him in a Nazi uniform uh, as a local official, and we even found a picture with he and Hitler. (</sentence><sentence id="99">Laughter) But it was uh,...I relate these to show the the people over there almost universally in quotes did not know what the Nazis were doing, and they were not Nazis, yet we found most of them did know.</sentence><sentence id="100">Now getting over uh, towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, uh, uh, in uh, one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, uh, very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>...it couldn't have been more than oh thirty or forty miles away, up in the Hartz (ph) Mountains, we came across this almost bucolic scene.</sentence><sentence id="101">A beautiful uh, landscaped uh, uh, estate and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> around uh, and walking around were girls pushing uh, baby carriages and uh, uh, young pregnant women.</sentence><sentence id="102">Well, we found out later that these women had become pregnant with uh, uh, German soldiers and the children were uh, taken after they had reached a few years old and put into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, taken away from their mothers and put into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and later on as they grew up, there was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">Now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span>...these kids were actually put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and trained uh, as soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="104">Uh, it was kind of interesting that when we came upon the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, we had uh, we had a little fire from uh, uh, back uh, behind some <span class="DLF">barricades</span>, and we found out that they were they were kids fourteen and fifteen years of age, but we talked them into stopping it, and these were actual children that were uh, uh, that were out of this this little <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I don't know, but it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hartz Mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">I relate this to show that three or four days later we came across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">Uh, a diametric uh, scene.</sentence><sentence id="108">Uh, we were uh, our troops, the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion uh, was a uh, attached to the 7th Corps and we normally were then attached to any division that needed combat engineer uh, needed more combat engineer troops, primarily if they had uh, if they had <span class="DLF">bridges</span> to build or <span class="DLF">roads</span> or any type of engineering work, but we were assigned uh, uh, in this <span class="REGION">area</span> to the uh, uh, the 1st Division, the 104th Division and or the 3rd Armored.</sentence><sentence id="109">Uh, these troops, the infantry and armored, would move ahead of us and we'd come in and uh, repair the <span class="DLF">roads</span> so that the uh, the support troops could come up or we would go ahead and build <span class="DLF">bridges</span> so they could move across them.</sentence><sentence id="110">Uh, the 104th uh, Infantry uh, uh, and I believe the 3rd Armored went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">Uh, when they arrived there they found the most horrible situation that uh, a person can ever explain.</sentence><sentence id="112">Uh, I came in probably a day or two days later.</sentence><sentence id="113">It it couldn't have been more than a day later.</sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, my first recollection was moving in with my uh, with my platoon into a uh, <span class="DLF">railroad yards</span>, and German civilians were uh, well looting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">They would break open the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and take any food out and of course they hadn't had any food and uh, so they'd uh, go get anything they could in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">Well, there over on a <span class="DLF">siding</span> there was this one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that uh, nobody had broken into and we went over there and uh, the smell incidentally was horrible, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, all over.</sentence><sentence id="117">The closer we got to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> uh, the worse the smell got.</sentence><sentence id="118">When I got over there I saw fluids dripping out of the the uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">We opened one up and uh, uh, all I can compare it to is a group of fish slithering out of a <span class="DLF">net</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">These people were packed in uh, and they were dead and they had started into deteriorate.</sentence><sentence id="121">The uh, the body fluids were dripping out and we...uh, well, many of us got sick.</sentence><sentence id="122">Uh, other uh, groups of our battalion were in uh, other parts of the uh, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">What uh, we did uh, was to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...after we'd found all this, we went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and uh, ordered all the able-bodied people to...men, to come out and help bury.</sentence><sentence id="124">Uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, uh, as I've heard since...there was actually two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> but I I have no recollection of that.</sentence><sentence id="125">I...it all melds into one...uh, uh, I didn't know it at the time but one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dora</span> and the other was uh, was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dora</span> was uh, I believe near a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> and uh, uh, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, you could be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and look into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">Well the people all swore they knew nothing about it.</sentence><sentence id="128">Uh, each of them must have been blind because we could see into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and see the dead bodies.</sentence><sentence id="129">Uh, I remember a couple of things.</sentence><sentence id="130">I remember opening a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> and seeing partially burned bodies.</sentence><sentence id="131">I remember the bodies in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, uh, some alive, some dead.</sentence><sentence id="132">Uh, in some instances there were people who were alive but barely alive that were laying right next to people that were dead.</sentence><sentence id="133">The uh, we got uh, all the able-bodied men that we could and we dug rough <span class="DLF">trenches</span> with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> and then we made the Germans and the German civilians uh, shovel uh, the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and make them perfect.</sentence><sentence id="134">They were beautiful <span class="DLF">trenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">Uh, straight up and down, across, up and very clean.</sentence><sentence id="136">The dirt was piled uh, up above the <span class="DLF">trench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">They...we allowed them to have masks over their face, but we didn't allow them any kind of gloves.</sentence><sentence id="138">They had to handle the dead bodies with their bare hands.</sentence><sentence id="139">We felt uh, rather strongly about this.</sentence><sentence id="140">Today I don't know whether I'd do the same thing but uh, at that time uh, there was a a hatred, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="141">We uh, made them carry uh, each individual body uh, they, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">Now they made <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> out of oh <span class="DLF">doors</span>, uh, they'd take two poles and put uh, a coat in between, or take real <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span>...any type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">makeshift stretcher</span>, but one person on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>, four people carrying them.</sentence><sentence id="143">They took them over.</sentence><sentence id="144">They laid them out neatly.</sentence><sentence id="145">We made them lay them out neatly and where they could put their hands over them, and then carry them and lay them in <span class="DLF">line</span> in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> uh, and then I don't know how they were buried because we left because the uh, before they were uh, covered up.</sentence><sentence id="146">But we tried to stick them with detail.</sentence><sentence id="147">Uh, I'll never forget seeing partially burned bodies.</sentence><sentence id="148">I saw a few little children.</sentence><sentence id="149">Uh, uh, everybody was emaciated.</sentence><sentence id="150">Uh, these people apparently had been, well obviously were workers in a V-2 factory, in a Mescherschmidt (ph) factory that they had there.</sentence><sentence id="151">Uh, the <span class="BUILDING">Mescherschmidt's factory</span> was uh, uh, in I believe three <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and uh, I won't go into detail about the about the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but needless to say we went into uh, we went into these and uh, they were the the ultimate of German precision, but all of the work was done by slave labor and the slave labor was uh, worked until they got sick and then they were and then they either died or they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="152">Uh, there apparently was no medical attention or any other type of attention and there was no food any <span class="NPIP">place</span> around.</sentence><sentence id="153">Possibly the Germans had taken what there was but there definitely was not any in the uh, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> themselves that the that the uh, that the uh, uh, camp or where these people were housed were large uh,...I don't recall whether they were brick or <span class="BUILDING">wood buildings</span>...but uh, filthy, uh, dirty, and it was just...the entire the entire uh, experience was something that even though we had seen uh, some of the things such as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> out on the <span class="DLF">farms</span>, where the people weren't treated quite as bad...uh, this was...we just never even conceived of this type of thing happening.</sentence><sentence id="155">Uh, we did not know at the... didn't even think about it, whether these were uh, were Jews or displaced people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or uh, where they were from.</sentence><sentence id="156">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> out on the <span class="DLF">farms</span>, they mostly were displaced people, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.534806" long="10.748806">Dora</span>, I think that the last of the Jewish people were uh, were in there in addition to others uh, but it...I just can't remember uh, uh, any of the stories.</sentence><sentence id="157">The the picture was so horrible.</sentence><sentence id="158">Uh, to this day uh, I'm normally a uh, person that's rather complacent, and I do not get into controversial discussions, but the one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I get angry, and obviously angry, is when I hear people question that this existed, and I've had this happen several times and my answer uh, with expletives is that yes, it did exist.</sentence><sentence id="159">I saw it and I smelled it and I've got pictures of it.</sentence><sentence id="160">Our battalion photographer took uh, uh, oh twelve or fourteen photographs of which I've uh, given to the uh, <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and uh, uh, it's kind of interesting.</sentence><sentence id="161">We had two photographers.</sentence><sentence id="162">Uh, one one's name was Garfinkel.</sentence><sentence id="163">He was a Jewish fellow, and Garfinkel could speak Yiddish and German and uh, we used to uh, have Garfinkel come over and interview German prisoners and he delighted in speaking Yiddish to them and uh, of course they could do nothing, nothing about it, but we we never controlled that type of thing.</sentence><sentence id="164">He uh, he usually interviewed them and and got what we wanted out of it.</sentence><sentence id="165">Garfinkel may or may not have been the one that took these.</sentence><sentence id="166">We had two photographers, and I think we have it on record uh, of who did.</sentence><sentence id="167">Uh, the photographs were taken by the 238th Engineers and they are uh, the original photographs.</sentence><sentence id="168">I know that they were taken.</sentence><sentence id="169">They were sent...they're probably in the uh, in the archives, because we sent uh, the copies of them through <span class="DLF">channels</span> as we did any document we had.</sentence><sentence

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh, by the name of Wimbleberg (ph), uh, and I was in effect the military governor of that.</sentence><sentence id="420">It's near <span

guarding a uh, large military prisoner of war camp.</sentence><sentence id="428">This uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had uh, at at the back of it was a large slag pile from coal uh,

called uh, anti-aircraft multiple mounts...four fifty calibre machine guns that were lowered down and aimed along there.</sentence><sentence id="435">If any one escaped, they were shot uh, and that's the only way we could control a hundred thousand people with probably two or three hundred uh, troops, and at night they had search lights that went down these.</sentence><sentence id="436">They'd have what we called a <span class="DLF">field</span> of fire...one down here, one down here and that zig-zagged around.</sentence><sentence id="437">Uh, this one particular <span

uh, many of them were guards in the un probably in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>, because this wasn't too far away from there, or <span

they are the ones that went into some of the trials, but they were in there because there were documented reasons for them being there.</sentence><sentence id="447">Uh, we uh, after after we were in the <span class="REGION">Nordhausen area</span> and <span class="REGION">Iceslaven area</span>, from then on why uh, we heard a lot of stories but we had no no direct contact with any uh, any type of slave labor or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> uh, camps.</sentence><sentence id="448">We were on...we left for uh, for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> uh, a couple of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="550">A: Well, we uh, uh, in about uh, June or it must have been July because the 4th of July I spent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="551">Uh, uh, the civil government came in and took over and we moved back to uh, back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where as engineers we became the ones that maintained <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">redeployment camps</span> and uh, we uh, kept oh the water supply and <span class="DLF">roads</span> and everything such as that, and we kept that up until October.</sentence><sentence id="552">Then I finally uh, got my orders to go 0 <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and uh, I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="553">I got the Queen Elizabeth.

(</sentence><sentence id="555">Laughter) And then when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the first thing that I remember is the Red Cross being on the <span class="DLF">docks</span> with great big uh, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> loaded with milk, and they gave us all the milk we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="556">See we hadn't had milk for oh two years, fresh milk, and that was the thing that we that we liked the most.</sentence><sentence id="557">But after that I I landed about the 13th of October and I called my girlfriend up and told her I was coming <span

else...well, I I can add uh, there are uh, quite a few people who are in my uh, uh, in the 238th Engineer Combat Battalion Association.</sentence><sentence id="561">We still meet.</sentence><sentence id="562">We've had forty-four meetings, every year since then.</sentence><sentence id="563">It's a small group - five hundred people originally in it and we still have two hundred that are active.</sentence><sentence id="564">Many of those do remember uh, uh, the incidents.</sentence><sentence id="565">I've made several tapes which I've given to the uh, to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and uh, I'm having, we're having a meeting next week and at that time why uh, uh, we've invited a member of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> to come over and we'll talk in detail.</sentence><sentence id="566">One of the things that that I have noticed uh, (cough), excuse me...uh, over the years uh, uh, why we didn't talk about this, about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>, I don't know, but it was years before uh, we had any discussion upon it.</sentence><sentence id="567">I never recall discussing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span> in to any degree in any of our meetings.</sentence><sentence id="568">Now it wasn't because we wanted to put it out of our mind.</sentence><sentence id="569">It uh,...I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="570">Uh, it was only after uh, we had uh, uh, found the photographs...uh, the commanding officer had the photographs along with several hundred others of the battalion and we got to discussing that and then I believe that uh, early in the 1980's that there was a trend towards uh, publicizing the fact that all this happened, probably because of what I'd experienced...people denying that it existed, and uh, even today I find that people in that unit are uh, rather reluctant to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="571">Now why this is I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="572">It may be because their memories have uh, have slipped.</sentence><sentence id="573">Uh, I could only find four or five who would uh, uh, say that they recalled this.</sentence><sentence id="574">I've tried to get them to talk about it and uh, I can't.</sentence><sentence id="575">They'll say well, yes, I remember that but they won't go in to detail.</sentence><sentence id="576">I'm wondering if possibly they may have uh, unconsciously put it out of their minds.</sentence><sentence id="577">It was so horrible.</sentence><sentence id="578">Uh, I can't I cannot believe uh, in my own mind that people are are capable of that, and in my own mind I think I do separate the actual accident or actual incident uh, with the uh, with how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="579">Do you get what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="580">The uh, uh, the fact that people did that versus the physical dead bodies is is to a degree separated in my own mind.</sentence><sentence id="581">I can't uh, I guess subconsciously I can't believe that it uh, that it could have been done, yet uh, uh, the odor is still firmly impressed in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="582">Uh, if I smell a dead body of any kind I immediately think about that.</sentence><sentence id="583">So uh, it did happen.</sentence><sentence id="584">Uh, I I am pleased that the uh, the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and that others are uh, uh, trying to uh, document all of this.</sentence><sentence id="585">I I believe in my own mind that if uh, if it isn't documented, more and more people are going to come by and say, did it really happen.</sentence><sentence id="586">I can say it happened because I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="587">But those of us that saw it are probably within ten or fifteen years of not being here, and there'll be nobody that saw it.</sentence><sentence id="588">And uh, these documentaries like this are the only thing 1 that will be existing uh, and so uh, I, every opportunity I get now I talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="589">I don't want to hold back anything.</sentence><sentence id="590">The sordid details are very important uh, because they they tend to emphasize that man's inhumanity to man is is there and one other thing that I can say...uh, uh, a little incident happened to me that uh, is unrelated to the Holocaust but it's related to the, to what can happen.</sentence><sentence id="591">We were crossing...we were building a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> just before _ fell, and I was in charge of of preparing the the uh, <span
