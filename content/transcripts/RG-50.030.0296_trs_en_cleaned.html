<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I need you to start off please by telling me what your name was at the time of the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="5">Where you were born and on what date?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: My name was Gertrude Granirer and I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">Some 10 miles away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">And I was born September 28, 1921.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: The name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: The name, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sadagura</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="15">The meaning of that word, Sad means <span class="DLF">garden</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gura</span> means <span class="DLF">hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">A <span class="DLF">garden</span> on the <span class="DLF">hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">And this is -- the word was, I believe, Ukrainian.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="22">Q: Was it a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="24">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="25">For me it was a lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">Only three thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="27">Very small.</sentence><sentence id="28">And all my studying I did in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernivtsi</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: Did you have a comfortable childhood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="36">A: Very comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="37">I was an only child and they discovered very early in my life that I had an inclination or a talent for music.</sentence><sentence id="38">I would go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, which was almost in every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a middle class family, and I would play whatever I heard people singing and so they started me very early -- I was four years old.</sentence><sentence id="39">And when I was six I already played little concerts.</sentence><sentence id="40">But my mother was not very keen for me to become a professional musician.</sentence><sentence id="41">It was only to round out my education.</sentence><sentence id="42">In fact, when she realized that I became very involved with music, she didn't like it very much.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="43">But by that time it was too late.</sentence><sentence id="44">I was also, through my father, very interested in languages.</sentence><sentence id="45">My father had been turned from the first World War with a shrapnel (ph) in his hip which could never be removed.</sentence><sentence id="46">And so he was a -- what do you call it -- a disabled person.</sentence><sentence id="47">And he couldn't walk very much.</sentence><sentence id="48">He was a lawyer and he loved me very much and so I loved him too.</sentence><sentence id="49">I was constantly next to him and he was very proud of my achievement.</sentence><sentence id="50">Whatever he had taught me I knew.</sentence><sentence id="51">I would know all the <span class="BUILDING">capitols</span> in the world of all the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and I would know all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> and all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> even in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">And he never dreamed of going, leaving our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">And so when I was about six years old I spoke five languages and had made up my mind that I would study languages.</sentence><sentence id="54">If possible, one new language each year.</sentence><sentence id="55">I came up to ten languages and then the world fell apart.</sentence><sentence id="56">And I realized that I could not afford that luxury any more.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: You said the world fell apart?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: Well, 1938 and 39 we heard a lot of rumblings what went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">We saw many people running away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">Some of them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Illwolf</span> (ph) and coming into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">And some of us opened our <span class="DLF">doors</span> for them and they told us how horrible things were.</sentence><sentence id="62">And we heard a great deal about Hitler and on the radio when he was on, everybody listened.</sentence><sentence id="63">And everybody was afraid, but nobody believed that he would, in fact, come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">We just felt very sorry for the people in those other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where Hitler was.</sentence><sentence id="65">And in 1940 Hitler and Stalin made this agreement.</sentence><sentence id="66">1940.</sentence><sentence id="67">Ah, and they were suddenly good friends.</sentence><sentence id="68">In this agreement Stalin got half of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the Baltic States, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span>, which was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, and for a good measure they also marched into the Bukovina which was never theirs before.</sentence><sentence id="69">Why they did it, we don't know.</sentence><sentence id="70">I don't know to this date.</sentence><sentence id="71">But suddenly one day there was an ultimatum on the radio and the next day the Soviets marched in.</sentence><sentence id="72">And before we knew it, we were Soviet citizens.</sentence><sentence id="73">We did not know what would happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="74">In fact, their propaganda was so good that we, in fact, thought it must be better than it was because before that the Rumanians were close friends with the Nazis and, in fact, they did the bidding of the Nazis and Atonescu was the head.</sentence><sentence id="75">Well, so we thought "this is an improvement".</sentence><sentence id="76">But somehow I have to get back for a moment.</sentence><sentence id="77">My mother has, had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>, <span class="REGION">South America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">Very rich man.</sentence><sentence id="79">He saw it coming and he chartered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and came to Europe to pick all his relatives and none of them wanted to go, including my parents.</sentence><sentence id="80">In our case, my parents said -- my father, which was my stepfather -- my father died when I was nine.</sentence><sentence id="81">My stepfather said "ah I have no reason to go and live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>, <span class="REGION">South America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">I haven't done anything wrong.</sentence><sentence id="83">I haven't engaged in politics, nothing is going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="84">I'm not going to throw away all the things that we have worked so hard for."</sentence><sentence id="85">And they stayed and they didn't ask me, so I stayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="86">So, in fact, my uncle who came by to pick us up, and we didn't go, said to us that in case we changed our mind he will had prepared four visas to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">Two for my parents, one for me, and one, preferably if I had a boyfriend to bring him along.</sentence><sentence id="88">Because at that time I was sixteen, seventeen.</sentence><sentence id="89">Ah, it would be better he thought.</sentence><sentence id="90">Well we didn't go and so the Soviets marched in and the world fell apart for us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Times were not tough under the <span class="COUNTRY">Rumanians</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Yes, they were tough.</sentence><sentence id="127">They were very tough.</sentence><sentence id="128">And especially 1937, 1938, 1939, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="129">Soldiers and particularly officers.</sentence><sentence id="130">And they got often drunk and they roamed the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and cursed the Jews and shot, you know, they went around with guns.</sentence><sentence id="131">It was frightening.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Did you feel particularly vulnerable as a girl?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: Some.</sentence><sentence id="141">I had times where I felt very vulnerable.</sentence><sentence id="142">And I have a hard time trying to bring back many memories which I probably have absolutely wanted to forget.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: Were the girls abused?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="149">Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: So you said that the Soviets came in and the world fell apart?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="155">The strange thing at that time -- it was June 28, 1940.</sentence><sentence id="156">That is when the Soviets marched in.</sentence><sentence id="157">And, you know, during the day and in the early part of the evening, it was fantastic what kind of concerts they gave.</sentence><sentence id="158">What kind of excitement they managed to bring out in the people and nobody would have believed that a few days later, during the night, they came and people disappeared in the thousands.</sentence><sentence id="159">And at that time we didn't know where they were taken.</sentence><sentence id="160">And it so happened that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which we lived we had a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">Probably the best <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were very wealthy and that was very much against us.</sentence><sentence id="162">I didn't even realize it at that time because I was friends with all kinds of children, never thinking about these things.</sentence><sentence id="163">But, immediately there were people who wanted this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they moved in and then one night three uniformed men came in the Russian uniform of what was called NK VD, which is now called MVD or KGB.They rang the doorbell.</sentence><sentence id="164">They came in.</sentence><sentence id="165">They searched our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">We didn't know why.</sentence><sentence id="167">My stepfather, my mother, my grandmother and I were made to sit in the corner and I noticed how this one -- after they had turned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> upside down -- this one of them said "hey look there" while he was pulling out a handkerchief and blowing his nose and I saw how he dropped something, and at the same moment he said "look here what they have" and it was either a five or a ten dollar bill.</sentence><sentence id="168">It was the first time in my life that I saw a dollar bill.</sentence><sentence id="169">But I didn't know the implication of this.</sentence><sentence id="170">I was going to say "you dropped this from your pocket" but I couldn't because the next thing all three of them came up to my father and said "you just have to come with us.</sentence><sentence id="171">We found foreign currency in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">You just have to sign a paper and you will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="173">We never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="174">We don't know what they did to him.</sentence><sentence id="175">I know he was 48 years old at that time and my mother would go every day to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where many other people stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> with food to bring their husbands, to whom exactly the same thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="176">And after she went for -- I don't know, three weeks, one day another guard stood there and said "why are you coming here?</sentence><sentence id="177">Your husband isn't here".</sentence><sentence id="178">She said yes is here.</sentence><sentence id="179">I've been bringing this food for three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="180">If he is not here for a long time?</sentence><sentence id="181">And then one day the head guard called her in and said to her "don't come any more".</sentence><sentence id="182">She said my husband is here.</sentence><sentence id="183">He's not here any more and threw his shoe at her.</sentence><sentence id="184">And he said "here is your husband and don't ask any more questions or you will have the same ending".</sentence><sentence id="185">So we don't know, but I do suspect that they killed him and I don't know where he is buried and I wish I would.</sentence><sentence id="186">This was so traumatic for me.</sentence><sentence id="187">I think it was worse than anything that came afterwards, including the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="188">By the time the Nazis took us into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> I was so numb <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, I was so dead, I was not able to feel anything.</sentence><sentence id="189">And so when Sam told you about how we met, for me the world had ended and here was this man who had jokingly said "we can get married".</sentence><sentence id="190">That was the farthest from my thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="191">My mother had said "run and go wherever you can and hide."</sentence><sentence id="192">And I was running from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that evening for about ten hours until I came to this other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">It was very difficult because they had -- what do you call this, at night when you are not allowed to go -- curfew.</sentence><sentence id="194">Well I made it somehow, very tired, exhausted and very sad.</sentence><sentence id="195">And I thought of going to my parents" best friends at whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I had stayed a whole year until the end of May of that year.</sentence><sentence id="196">I came to their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">They opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they wouldn't let me in.</sentence><sentence id="198">And they told me forgive us.</sentence><sentence id="199">But last night, it was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>, next door, there was a raid and they came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they found one person in that family who did not have a permit with this particular address and because of that they took her and the entire family and they disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="200">And so these people would not let me in.</sentence><sentence id="201">At that moment I had no idea where to go.</sentence><sentence id="202">The only thing that remained was to remember the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">That's a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> was located where I had studied and where I had finished <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> about also four weeks before the Russians came.</sentence><sentence id="204">And I went upstairs into a <span class="INT_SPACE">projection room</span> where they also had a <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> and I fell down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and went to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="205">And when I woke up it was day and I thought if I could find somebody in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and if they would give me a job as a pianist, as a accompanist, maybe I could simply hide.</sentence><sentence id="206">But I knew they were after me because they were after our family and so I went and I met the man who was in charge and he was just closing up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">And I said I am looking for a job as an accompanist, as a pianist.</sentence><sentence id="208">He said to me "you look to me like you need a lunch, that's where I am going now".</sentence><sentence id="209">I said no, "please get me a job", but I didn't tell him what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="210">And he said how much money do you have and I said three rubles.</sentence><sentence id="211">That's 75 cents.</sentence><sentence id="212">And he said that's enough.</sentence><sentence id="213">I said enough for what.</sentence><sentence id="214">Enough to get married he said.</sentence><sentence id="215">He said I can see you don't know where you're going to sleep the next night, I can see it in your face.</sentence><sentence id="216">He didn't know my name, he didn't know who I was.</sentence><sentence id="217">So he starts walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I walked after him and I said please get me that job.</sentence><sentence id="218">And suddenly he stops and he says "come up here with me".</sentence><sentence id="219">Two flights of <span class="DLF">steps</span>, very dark, old, dilapidated <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and upstairs is a young girl, about seventeen, and this is supposed to be the <span class="BUILDING">Registrar's Office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">And so she asks him if he came to get married and he said yes.</sentence><sentence id="221">This girl, asks "are you living with another woman?" "</sentence><sentence id="222">No". "</sentence><sentence id="223">Do you have children with another woman?" "</sentence><sentence id="224">No".</sentence><sentence id="225">And she asked me the same thing and every question is an insult in my book because I, I was so properly brought up I didn't even have a date.</sentence><sentence id="226">So when we were ready to sign this little paper she calls over the man who swept the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the corner.</sentence><sentence id="227">To this day I don't know his name.</sentence><sentence id="228">And he was the witness who signed and we went downstairs and Sam, my husband, said to me "by the way, what's your name?"</sentence><sentence id="229">And we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonia</span> and he enrolled me.</sentence><sentence id="230">Gave me a job as an accompanist, pianist, and he said "now no more running around.</sentence><sentence id="231">Five o'clock we meet in front of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>".</sentence><sentence id="232">I don't know what he thought.</sentence><sentence id="233">I didn't know where I would run but he had told me that he has a mother and a sister and an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">I didn't believe a word he said to me.</sentence><sentence id="235">I thought of one thing only.</sentence><sentence id="236">Where could I hide.</sentence><sentence id="237">And suddenly I realized that I had changed my name because I married.</sentence><sentence id="238">And my name is no longer the one that these authorities were looking for.</sentence><sentence id="239">So I went with him and when he came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, I had a big surprise.</sentence><sentence id="240">He did have a mother and he did have a sister and they were wonderful to me.</sentence><sentence id="241">And that was like a miracle somehow.</sentence><sentence id="242">That is the story.</sentence><sentence id="243">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="244">So.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Did you, what happened to your mother after that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: A few weeks later - my mother had, in the meantime, also left the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because all these other people who wanted our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> moved in and one person who probably had a little bit of heart said to my mother, "you better disappear from here or you will have a bad ending".</sentence></p><p><sentence id="340">So my mother came into this larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with her mother-in-law, and they rented a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they both went to find some job to become a proletarian, and my mother found a job to become a cook in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and I saw her a few times.</sentence><sentence id="341">I went every morning to this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to see her.</sentence><sentence id="342">And one morning I went there and there was a big sign. "</sentence><sentence id="343">This <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> has been confiscated and the inhabitants have been enemies of the people" and so I know that at this moment, my mother and my grandmother had disappeared, but we didn't know where.</sentence><sentence id="344">Now a long time later we found out -- not even so long, because in three nights 35,000 people had the same fate, and they were brought to an end <span class="BUILDING">station</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, and when they were filled they were, left the <span class="REGION">area</span> and nobody where to.</sentence><sentence id="345">But many, many years later we found out that they were taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="346">And my mother was 17 years in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">My grandmother died immediately, one or two days in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">And it's strange because my grandmother was only 73 and at that time my mother was 48.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Did your mother come back from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: We found her in the most difficult manner.</sentence><sentence id="351">We, after we went through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- actually first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>, <span class="REGION">South America</span> where my mother had a brother -- then we came here and my uncle, my mother's brother, found -- one day he received a letter by a lady, Mrs. Weisselberger (ph), who was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and roomed together with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="352">And there was a moment in the Soviet's time under Khrushchev when he decided -- you know, you remember that he stood up and said how what a monster Stalin had been -- and Khrushchev had then permitted people over 65 if they had close relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">And if these relatives sent an invitation to them, an obligated themselves to take care of them, he would permit them to come out.</sentence><sentence id="354">And this Mrs. Weisselberger who, by the way, was the widow of the, of the greatest Zionist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span>, and he was one of the first the Soviets did away with, and afterwards Mrs. Weissenberger was also taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> as the wife of the enemy of the people, and my mother had given Mrs. Weissenberger a photo that was taken in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and on the back of it had written the address of her brother in <span class="REGION">South America</span> because she didn't know what had happened to us.</sentence><sentence id="355">And so, when, when, he received this note he sent it to us.</sentence><sentence id="356">That's how we found her.</sentence><sentence id="357">Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: You were telling us about finding your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="368">A: As soon as we got this letter, and we lived in <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> and were already very successful as musicians, and well known.</sentence><sentence id="369">We knew Senator Humphry who was at that time the senator of <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span>, and we got in touch with him and he said he'd do whatever he could to see whether he could get her out.</sentence><sentence id="370">And after some time he said "sorry, the Soviets say they don't have such a person".</sentence><sentence id="371">Then some more time went by and we approached the other senator from <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span>, Senator Phye.</sentence><sentence id="372">He said he would try.</sentence><sentence id="373">And this was maybe a year later and at that time the Soviets said "yes, there is such a person".</sentence><sentence id="374">They would, would, let her out if somebody, some relative in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, would ask for her.</sentence><sentence id="375">She didn't have any relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but Sam had an uncle.</sentence><sentence id="376">He wrote to him and this uncle, who had never set eyes on my mother, had filled out some papers and she was finally permitted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="377">But I have to tell you that this, from the moment we had this first notification that she had survived and until she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, was eight years.</sentence><sentence id="378">So after she arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we did whatever we could and we brought her to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I saw her again and we were like two complete strangers.</sentence><sentence id="379">She was so different.</sentence><sentence id="380">She was so hard -- so, so aloof.</sentence><sentence id="381">I can't even describe it and there was nothing much I could do.</sentence><sentence id="382">I wanted very much to ask her to talk and she couldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="383">Finally I got it out of her.</sentence><sentence id="384">One day I got very angry and I said "please, tell me what has happened; can't you tell me?"</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="961">Q: When were you liberated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="963">A: We were "liberated" in I'd say 1944.</sentence><sentence id="964">But very early in the year.</sentence><sentence id="965">I would say we began to hear noises like cannons -- I think it was January or February -- and I said to Sam "now the front is getting so close, now they will kill us all."</sentence><sentence id="966">Because it was well known that the Germans, when they retreated, they set a whole thing on fire and they killed everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="967">And I said "it's unbelievable that we have survived until now and now we're going to die", and you know, this was January, February, no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> to hide in.</sentence><sentence id="968">At least in the summer the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> have leaves, you know, no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> to hide in.</sentence><sentence id="969">None of the native Ukrainians wanted to hide us.</sentence><sentence id="970">They would not risk their life, you know.</sentence><sentence id="971">And I said, "Sam, what are we going to do?"</sentence><sentence id="972">and I got so vehement and so excited that I banged with my foot on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in which we lived, and suddenly as I banged, I heard a hollow noise as though it was empty underneath and I said, "Sam, did you hear what I just heard?</sentence><sentence id="973">It seems to me that there is nothing <span class="NPIP">underneath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">Maybe we could hide there."</sentence><sentence id="975">And we had a neighbor who 7 was an engineer, Rosenfeld, and he was the kind of man -- what his job was, he went also out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the morning, worked for, for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but he fixed radios.</sentence><sentence id="976">So he was the one who radios all day long and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and told us all the news that went on in the outside world, which was amazing because we never had a paper or anything or a radio.</sentence><sentence id="977">So we told Rosenfeld -- I told him -- we are going to have to hide if we want to survive and nobody will take us in.</sentence><sentence id="978">Could we try and see if we could hide right in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, I have heard a hollow sound.</sentence><sentence id="979">And he just had a smile but he humored me and he came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he tried and he said "you are right".</sentence><sentence id="980">So he brought -- where he got this, I don't know -- a saw.</sentence><sentence id="981">Now these were, these were <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> in the old fashioned kind, you know, long boards.</sentence><sentence id="982">And so he was sawing one board here and then two later, like this.</sentence><sentence id="983">Finally he made an <span class="DLF">opening</span> and we did find an <span class="DLF">opening</span> down there which was very raw and nothing in there, and everybody who was in our <span class="REGION">area</span> knew about it and laughed about us.</sentence><sentence id="984">They thought that I was crazy, out of my mind.</sentence><sentence id="985">And when the day came and they, the shootings, came closer and closer, we had amassed a lot of straw which we had brought into our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and since about 18 people knew about this crazy idea, these 18 people came and went downstairs with us and we thought it would be an hour or two or three.</sentence><sentence id="986">Well, they kept coming and coming and before we knew it, we were standing one next to the other and how many were we -- 68 people down there.</sentence><sentence id="987">We closed this thing and had all this straw on top and all of a sudden -- now this was already night -- all of a sudden we heard footsteps on top of us.</sentence><sentence id="988">We knew that the Germans were running away but we heard footsteps directly above us and we recognized by their marching, by their walking, that these were Germans.</sentence><sentence id="989">What had happened -- they had chosen that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stay over night because they didn't see anybody there and there was a lot of straw there, and we sat there underneath, 68 people not daring to breathe or cough or anything, and the next morning they left.</sentence><sentence id="990">And then we began to, to smell smoke.</sentence><sentence id="991">And we knew that they had put some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on fire and someone in our group of 68 people -- a woman started yelling, "I don't want to die, to suffocate here.</sentence><sentence id="992">I want out.</sentence><sentence id="993">I want out."</sentence><sentence id="994">So by that time we opened the thing and the Germans were gone.</sentence><sentence id="995">We came out.</sentence><sentence id="996">We were green and white as a sheet and we saw in front of us three young Russian boys with very long coats and with rifles and we asked them "who are you" and they said "nastuyahschi (ph), Russki partisani (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="997">We are the real Russian partisans.</sentence><sentence id="998">And they said to us "and who are you" and we tried to explain to them.</sentence><sentence id="999">They didn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1000">That's how we were liberated.</sentence><sentence id="1001">They we could dream only of going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1002">That's a very different story.</sentence><sentence id="1003">We couldn't get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until a few days later because we found a truck driver who wanted vodka and then he gave him the vodka and he took us up to a forrest and dropped us down there and said "that's enough for you."</sentence><sentence id="1004">And then -- 8</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1047">Q: Where did you get the vodka?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1049">A: Where did we get the vodka?</sentence><sentence id="1050">We ran around among the natives and whatever we still had on us we shared.</sentence><sentence id="1051">And the worst thing was when we finally came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1052">We were dreaming of returning to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1053">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1054">We waited for hours and hours and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1055">And on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span>, a woman came close to Sam and said "don't go up the Banastrasse (ph)", the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the railroad people because they are taking people to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1056">She said it only in Yiddish, in a short word mancopt (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1057">That means they are catching people.</sentence><sentence id="1058">So we did not go there and so we were sort of trying to get to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which we finally made and there were some people there and they, when we opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said this is our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they said "it's not going to be very long your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because you are not going to be here very long because this is our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1059">So we very quickly disappeared from there.</sentence><sentence id="1060">And then we tried desperately to get into the Czech Army, which we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1073">Q: Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1075">A: We had to go somewhere and we had to go as far west as we could.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1077">Q: Why the Czech Army?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1079">A: Because they were there.</sentence><sentence id="1080">We had no choices.</sentence><sentence id="1081">The Czech army were wonderful to us.</sentence><sentence id="1082">And we were good to them but they were wonderful to us.</sentence><sentence id="1083">And we were constantly in the Czech Army between the devil and the deep blue <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Because in front of us were the Nazis, never more than one or two miles, no more.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And behind us were the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="1086">So, we were there from middle 1944 until 1945.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1095">Q: Was it frightening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1097">A: Frightening?</sentence><sentence id="1098">Different.</sentence><sentence id="1099">Very different because, first of all, we had one or two meals a day.</sentence><sentence id="1100">It was beans, always beans, but it was something.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Much more than we had before.</sentence><sentence id="1102">And frightening yes because at every step you were stepping on a <span class="DLF">mine</span> or one of your colleagues were killed, or somebody lost their eyes, or somebody lost their limbs.</sentence><sentence id="1103">I did a lot of concertizing (ph) for the Czech Army soldiers before they were sent out into battle with an accordion and singing folk songs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1111">Q: Did you play the accordion or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1113">A: Both.</sentence><sentence id="1114">And I knew that when I am sent out to sing for a thousand soldiers, I knew these 9 were being sent out into a battle.</sentence><sentence id="1115">The next day I was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I found many of these people without arms, without legs, and this was a very small army, so we were very good friends all of us.</sentence><sentence id="1116">And this was very tough, but it was the best part of our odyssey.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1121">Q: I meant to ask you, in all of this time did your musical background play a part -- ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1123">A: In the Czech Army.</sentence><sentence id="1124">I knew that this was lost for me forever.</sentence><sentence id="1125">I could not believe that I would ever return to music.</sentence><sentence id="1126">I thought music is much too, too unimportant.</sentence><sentence id="1127">But I found out music is not unimportant.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Music is very, very important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1135">Q: So you were in the Czech Army until the war ended?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1186">Q: They were independent of every one else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
