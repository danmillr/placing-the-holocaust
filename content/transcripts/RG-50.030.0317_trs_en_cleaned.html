<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Can you tell us your name and where you were born and when?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in 1920, the 30th of April in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">Then we lived there for a while.</sentence><sentence id="6">Q. What was your name at birth?A. Ava Mueller.</sentence><sentence id="7">And I remember that one of the German Gestapo people when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> asked me, you could not be Jewish because my name is Mueller, and I said maybe I'm not, but it didn't help me too much.</sentence><sentence id="8">It shows you -- and even Jewish language is so very similar to the German, so many names, so many words are the same.</sentence><sentence id="9">Q. What is your name now?A. My name now is Ava Dorfman.</sentence><sentence id="10">That is my husband of 39 years, and I lost him in 1988, on July 3rd, suddenly, very suddenly.</sentence><sentence id="11">Q. You were born in ?</sentence><sentence id="12">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="13">Q. Did you stay there for very long?A. I suppose we stayed until a certain age.</sentence><sentence id="14">I think I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, already to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parochial</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="15">There was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">I attended there.</sentence><sentence id="17">Then my mother --.Q. Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="18">Was that unusual for a Jewish person to attend that school?A. There were only two or three Jewish people in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I lived, so, we were really very removed from the Jewish section of .</sentence><sentence id="19">Then, my mother had family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, so a portion of my life I spend there, and I lived on Liechtenstein Strauss in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">Then, my father's family lived in , and my mother felt that I and my sister Ruzia who was 2 1/2 years older than I, that we should somehow be closer to the family, to know our grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="21">She did not have too much family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> of her close, and then we moved back</sentence><sentence id="23">to , where my grandparents own a <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, four story, and my grandfather had a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, and they lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lower level</span>, and then on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>, my mother, Ruzia and I, you see when I was six months old I lost my father, so I actually never knew him.</sentence><sentence id="24">There was just a <span class="INT_SPACE">study</span> where there was a drawing, and that drawing was my father.</sentence><sentence id="25">There were pictures that my mother always showed.</sentence><sentence id="26">He was 27 years of age and developed a severe case of kidney problems.</sentence><sentence id="27">He just got his degree in civil engineering.</sentence><sentence id="28">My mother was only 25, and they looked forward but he didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="29">So, between the draw and the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> that my grandmother took us always, that was what I know of father.</sentence><sentence id="30">I didn't envy anyone that they may have had more material things, but I envy everyone who was able to sit on the father's lap or get a kiss from a father.</sentence><sentence id="31">That somehow I missed always.</sentence><sentence id="32">Q. What do you remember about your mother?A. My mother was very pretty, very educated.</sentence><sentence id="33">She spoke five languages.</sentence><sentence id="34">We were just -- when we grow up we were like sisters, but when she was sometimes saying, I'm only 28 years of age, I said "Well, you're so old."</sentence><sentence id="35">But we all do that, and she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span>, which was very big <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, as an interpreter and also as a executive secretary to a director named Rightman.</sentence><sentence id="36">He was Jewish, and then I understand from another friend, who is a gynecologist that the other director's son, Shal, was his name, is someplace in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and then I was befriended, maybe she was my best friend was Shisko.</sentence><sentence id="37">They were Czechoslovakian decent, and she and I went together in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and as I will tell you later on, she played a major role in my life.</sentence><sentence id="38">And my mother worked there, and so it was a necessary that we were with the grandparents together and then above us was another aunt.</sentence><sentence id="39">She had four children.</sentence><sentence id="40"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marguerita</span> was so pretty.</sentence><sentence id="41">They all perished.</sentence><sentence id="42">Then there was another aunt who was childless, and then she was just like a mother.</sentence><sentence id="43">She was battling a cancer in her larynx and that was the time really that she wanted to see that we would be married so she could see the weddings.</sentence><sentence id="44">I think that's what prompted one time whatever I will tell you about.</sentence><sentence id="45">What I would like to say that it is so hard sometimes to comprehend when people speak of six million, and also the fact that one million and a half were innocent children, does not say that we all were not just innocent, justly paid just</sentence><sentence id="47">because we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="48">The fact that everyone of the six million was a person with loved ones, with friends, with dreams for the future, and then they had to face death by whatever means those murderers had for them.</sentence><sentence id="49">They had a great many of them.</sentence><sentence id="50">Then, since you spoke with me and I really tried to search my mind.</sentence><sentence id="51">I must have really, like excavating the back memories from my brain, and reach so many gruesome stories, that I tried very hard to suppress.</sentence><sentence id="52">I know that lots of Holocaust survivors share those gruesome stories with their children.</sentence><sentence id="53">I don't know what effect that had on them, but before I got married in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I decided if I ever have a family, I would like to establish as a nearly normal life as it can be.</sentence><sentence id="54">I didn't want my children to be sorry for their mother.</sentence><sentence id="55">I didn't want them to have the feeling that they are different from the other children, so I really was very evasive about it.</sentence><sentence id="56">The only thing at night, I had very bad dreams, as my husband was telling me.</sentence><sentence id="57">I sometimes screamed or just said don't let them take me.</sentence><sentence id="58">So I shared lots of things with my husband, and not until the children were in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and there were many documentaries shown on T.V. and the newspapers and they always asked, "Mom do you know anything about it?</sentence><sentence id="59">Have you been there?"</sentence><sentence id="60">And then little by little I would just tell them, not very much.</sentence><sentence id="61">I have been asked by so many <span class="BUILDING">organizations</span> to speak about my past.</sentence><sentence id="62">I refused it.</sentence><sentence id="63">The only time I spoke was the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran Church</span>, and that was only because that the minister there felt that everybody who is not Lutheran is going to go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and of course, I just thought I'd tell them what <span class="NPIP">hell</span> really was.</sentence><sentence id="64">That's the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> I spoke.</sentence><sentence id="65">But, I feel right now that even my children encourage me that I should give testimony.</sentence><sentence id="66">Just like my son called me yesterday and he said, "Good luck Mom.</sentence><sentence id="67">I think you owe to the younger generation, because it should never be forgotten what happened."</sentence><sentence id="68">I personally being so attuned to the anti-semitism which is going right now on, not only in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, but in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="69">I'm scared for the future generation because just like I hope that the Holocaust in <span class="BUILDING">Washington Museum</span> or any other <span class="BUILDING">Museums</span> or Memorials which were erected in memory of the six million will be able to educate the people what hatred and bigotry can do, and what they have done even to homosexuals and lesbians.</sentence><sentence id="70">They tortured them, and it was just because they had other sex preferences.</sentence><sentence id="71">We should let the people live for what they are, and therefore I feel that I consented</sentence><sentence id="73">to it.</sentence><sentence id="74">But I have to tell you that the last two weeks, I weighed all together 99 pounds, and I'm pretty sure I'm down to maybe 80.</sentence><sentence id="75">I can hardly eat or sleep.</sentence><sentence id="76">It's hard for me to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="77">There comes something that one son knows about and the other son still doesn't.</sentence><sentence id="78">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> I met many people, but one in particular was a medical student.</sentence><sentence id="79">He was like five and half or six years older than I. He visited us when we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">Then, as I mentioned, my aunt who was childless, she was very eager to have a wedding, especially at that time, the rumors what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because I think had in 1932 that Hitler started the revolution already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and at one point I heard my family speaking, oh he's just a maniac.</sentence><sentence id="81">They don't let him succeed.</sentence><sentence id="82">They will stop him.</sentence><sentence id="83">But how wrong they were.</sentence><sentence id="84">So, at one point, my aunt entertained that maybe we will get married.</sentence><sentence id="85">His family was not very well to do and neither was mine.</sentence><sentence id="86">He found a <span class="NPIP">position</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="87">was near which was a <span class="DLF">port</span>, and in September of "39 the German invaded or bombed .</sentence><sentence id="88">This is the time that my marriage was of seven months only.</sentence><sentence id="89">That's why I do not have any recollection.</sentence><sentence id="90">We hardly knew each other as a married couple.</sentence><sentence id="91">Q. How long did you know him before getting married?A. I think around four years.</sentence><sentence id="92">Q. What was his name?A. Edmond Spritzer (ph).</sentence><sentence id="93">When the German started to bomb , and they finally marched in from , they start to round up the Jewish young men, able bodied, and that would happen with Mungio, and since then, I never saw him.</sentence><sentence id="94">I never had a trace of it neither.</sentence><sentence id="95">I have met any of his family members of his family.</sentence><sentence id="96">My cousin, who lives now in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, her son is by the way a member of the Parliament from <span class="COUNTRY">Wales</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">They did not stay with Judaism, and he was born as a Episcopalian, but I don't blame them.</sentence><sentence id="98">There were many times that I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="99">If I were to have a family, I would not want them to be exposed to what I went through.</sentence><sentence id="100">She and her mother were visiting , and my mother by the way was visiting me, and the panic was so great because it was on the Baltic, _ It was a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> also.</sentence><sentence id="101">Everybody tried to get inland, and also reach their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">What vividly</sentence><sentence id="104">stayed in my mind after searching my memory that I pushed my mother in through a <span class="DLF">window</span> because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was so jammed that she can go and also in some way was able to place her mother and then she and I stayed a while there.</sentence><sentence id="105">We didn't have any possessions there, but when it start to be very bad, she was married around three years to Doctor and they were located where he practiced, and she and I decided that maybe we ought to go to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">That progressed so quickly.</sentence><sentence id="107">They started to bomb the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and we were just having the hardest time to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> which was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> maybe an hour and a half.</sentence><sentence id="108">It took us four days to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">When we came there, her husband , Said, look they are already progressing here.</sentence><sentence id="110">They are vandalizing, even the Polish people vandalizing <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">I think it would be wise if you and Ava start to make your way to .</sentence><sentence id="112">That's where her parents lived and my mother and Ruzia, and her father was a very prominent oral surgeon, Doctor Katzner.</sentence><sentence id="113">It took us twelve days, ten or twelve days.</sentence><sentence id="114">Everytime the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was bombed, we had to jump, no matter how high the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was into the embarkment.</sentence><sentence id="115">We were bleeding all over.</sentence><sentence id="116">Our clothes were torn.</sentence><sentence id="117">We didn't have food.</sentence><sentence id="118">But when we stopped, there happened to be a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">The people came out and said, what is going on.</sentence><sentence id="120">Tell us where they are, and brought some food out to us.</sentence><sentence id="121">When we find, as you know at that time the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> there was the agreement between the foreign minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and who was the foreign minister from Stalin's, from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bog River</span> east of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bog River</span> the Russians will invade that portion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">That of course was thiscamp__----.~- So when we made our way to , she was financially better situated so they lived in a completely different <span class="REGION">area</span>, and I lived on the front area.</sentence><sentence id="123">As a matter of fact, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, they took only possession, a and it was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="124">That was the only thing we could cover ourselves at night, because we didn't have anything else.</sentence><sentence id="125">I did not make a contact with her until after the war.</sentence><sentence id="126">I did not know what happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="127">If you are interested I will tell you about it, but when I reach , my mother quickly put me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> because I don't remember if there were passports, or were they some types of documents that they had to be identified by because the Russians went</sentence><sentence id="129">from one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to another to take a survey as to how many people are there.</sentence><sentence id="130">So, Mother was afraid that they will arrest me because I was the newcomer and they were already there.</sentence><sentence id="131">So, through the contacts of my sister's husband, who was .</sentence><sentence id="132">She was already married, he was a mathematician and he was working, help the Russians, and he was able to get some papers.</sentence><sentence id="133">I don't know what they said.</sentence><sentence id="134">I know that I was able to come out.</sentence><sentence id="135">That time, the Russians confiscated lots of <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and took us to work, but I didn't feel good.</sentence><sentence id="136">I felt that I was lightheaded.</sentence><sentence id="137">I was sick to my stomach and did not know maybe malnutrition or whatever and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that time was already socialized medicine.</sentence><sentence id="138">I went to see a doctor and found out that I was two or three months pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="139">I don't even remember.</sentence><sentence id="140">To this day, I don't know how the pregnancy was not interrupted from jumping so many times.</sentence><sentence id="141">Sometimes we had to jump every fifteen minutes because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was so terribly bombed, and I just was pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="142">My grandparents were still alive at that time.</sentence><sentence id="143">My grandfather in particular was religious.</sentence><sentence id="144">My mother was very much for aborting the child, but my grandfather felt no.</sentence><sentence id="145">So, I still was working, not too much food to begin with, and my sister was working, but she was still living with her husband, more near which was more of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">She played beautifully <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>, and her desire was one time to become maybe a pianist.</sentence><sentence id="147">I don't remember if she already had her son, Gaynish, but I know when the German came he was around a year and half out, so I will have to calculated it back.</sentence><sentence id="148">Everything is just like a bad dream.</sentence><sentence id="149">However, we were working, and I think I worked until my eight months, very hard because they did not let us stop.</sentence><sentence id="150">I don't recall what we were doing, but I do recall that there was like a quota.</sentence><sentence id="151">If you didn't make so many pieces in one hour, they will push you to a very bad job, sometimes cleaning the worst <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> that you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="152">So I was very, very pressed, and not feeling well.</sentence><sentence id="153">I was rushed out to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to deliver, and she was a beautiful -- her name was Lydia.</sentence><sentence id="154">She was like 2 1/2 months old and everybody thought she looked like an angle, but somehow, due to the milk, there was not a formula or anything.</sentence><sentence id="155">Nothing was sterilized, she developed dysentery, like a very bad case of diarrhea, and the doctor hospitalized her.</sentence><sentence id="156">I went every day to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> after work, and they showed me through a <span class="DLF">window</span> because they felt it was a communicable disease.</sentence><sentence id="157">But one</sentence><sentence id="159">day I came and they didn't show her and they say she's dead.</sentence><sentence id="160">That was I think she was only three months or three and a half months old.</sentence><sentence id="161">That took lots and lots of maneuvering really to get the body out so we can bury her near my father, so she wouldn't be alone.</sentence><sentence id="162">That was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="163">But the Russian was not very easy to live under either.</sentence><sentence id="164">They just unannounced would knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, came and took whatever they liked.</sentence><sentence id="165">My mother had some nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">china</span> and they wanted it so it was not even would you give me.</sentence><sentence id="166">I remember being just so attached to the drawing that that was my father and never knew him, but from the pictures sometimes he stood at the foot of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I could visualize him and I was a fan of his that he had a very nice and of other literary writers and philosophers like Hiner Shuller, a man, and I thought one day I will have it in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">Well, it stayed there until the Germans came, but then they raped also some people-- the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="168">They also came and tortured you that tomorrow they come and they emptied out, but mostly they were like and when they find our watches they just have like five watches on one hand and the other, they never had those things.</sentence><sentence id="169">Or they took a nightgown from the women and just wear it as a dress.</sentence><sentence id="170">They were very primitive.</sentence><sentence id="171">My mother felt that they interfere a lot in the war of and when we heard that eventually maybe the Germans come, my mother said, "It couldn't be worse."</sentence><sentence id="172">But once again, she was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="173">At least we were alive.</sentence><sentence id="174">Now, I spoke to a friend of mine who was very young when he left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">He's an orthopedist in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and I spoke to Andy Solenski, and I said, for some reason as a matter of fact the night before I came here, I said Andy for some reason I feel that the Germans attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and forced themselves into our <span class="REGION">territory</span> that there was in 1939 -- excuse me in 1941 that it was in June, because I remember that was my sister's birthday, and my mother baked a cake and asked and the little boy who was already alive, to come and stay with me.</sentence><sentence id="176">That same night we heard shots and commotion and we run to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we saw the Russian soldiers running with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> under their arm and we knew something is brewing, and that's how the Russians went out, because the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="177">Then, the other set of problems started.</sentence><sentence id="178">We were in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> still and I failed to say that my grandparents had a very hard time when the Russians were there.</sentence><sentence id="179">When they got</sentence><sentence id="181">drunk they came to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and sometimes with the bottles of liquor stayed and everything they would just push everything on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and just destroy it.</sentence><sentence id="182">They took it very hard that they could not operate and support the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="183">My grandmother took very ill and within one week of each other, they passed away.</sentence><sentence id="184">My uncle who was my father's brother, , his daughter is my cousin who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nira</span>, and is married to a non-Jewish, but non-believer really, a Parisian artist.</sentence><sentence id="185">She has a son Stephen and his wife Marie-Noell and they visited Mitchell and I here last year, and he continued to operate the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and we still lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the whole family together.</sentence><sentence id="186">But then they established a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and they start to line up the people and we had to leave everything behind, and my that I somehow thought I was going to have that from my father, and we moved and I don't remember the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with lots of stories, three or four stories.</sentence><sentence id="188">We moved to an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where one and a half <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, two families lived.</sentence><sentence id="189">My mother and I. Ruzia was still there, and another family with three children.</sentence><sentence id="190">It was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="191">But when the Russians left, &gt;&gt; who were very religious.</sentence><sentence id="192">The father had a beard.</sentence><sentence id="193">The mother had a .</sentence><sentence id="194">Idon't know what it is in English.</sentence><sentence id="195">A wig?</sentence><sentence id="196">Isee.</sentence><sentence id="197">They had a daughter who also by coincidence her name was Rose.</sentence><sentence id="198">Now, today, I think it is multiple sclerosis.</sentence><sentence id="199">She was unable to walk.</sentence><sentence id="200">She was bedridden, and the father of Zigmund encouraged Zigmund that still going back to the Russian occupation, encouraged the boys, there was Zigmund and two brothers.</sentence><sentence id="201">One of them now a year ago established contact with me , who by the way told me he saw my sister's husband Zigmund after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">He encouraged him to make his way to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but he knew he left my sister and a little child, and he told him he's going to try to reach ; Evidently he never did, because cannot put traces or find him, and never reached us.</sentence><sentence id="203">Whatever, we were not there to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="204">Then his father encouraged us to come and live in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they had a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, like four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">And it was once again, very hard to get milk or bread or anything and he was going courageously out trying to get something for his grandson.</sentence><sentence id="206">One time when he left he never came back, so when asked me what happened to my father, the only estimate I could say that they caught him or shoot him.</sentence><sentence id="207">I don't</sentence><sentence id="209">know.</sentence><sentence id="210">Then the mother did not know what to do with her daughter Rose, and I think she lost her mind.</sentence><sentence id="211">She was just going around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and screaming, and they must have shot her because she never came back, and here I was with Mom, myself, and then Ruzia was at that time, and Zigmund was already in the Russian Army and when the Russians were moving away when the Germans came, they followed the Russian army and that's why he felt then it would be better to have the German people come.</sentence><sentence id="212">We had both of the atrocities, and before we moved in with this other family, when I said that we lived in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that had few stories, it's hard to believe how many people jumped to their death from third or <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">I remember one prominent doctor who did it with his wife together because they didn't want to face what can happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="214">Q. Was this when the Germans came?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="215">Q. Did you see them?A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="216">So, that's why when you asked me to do that, after 50 years, which is a half century, to really delve into my memory things that I try so hard to suppress, it was very hard for me.</sentence><sentence id="217">Then, we didn't have any money, and we didn't have any means to support ourselves and there was already the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="218">I was wearing an arm band with the Star of David and J, Judea.</sentence><sentence id="219">I took off my arm band.</sentence><sentence id="220">I was very blonde, long hair, they say blue eyes.</sentence><sentence id="221">I always thought I have green eyes, and I went to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span>, and tried to bring beer, bottles of beer.</sentence><sentence id="222">It was very small, but I still feel that my wrists were very very affected by it.</sentence><sentence id="223">I had surgery here and <span class="DLF">carpal tunnel</span>, and I just went back and forth and sold the beer to the people who had money.</sentence><sentence id="224">Mama was able to get a bushel of flour and make something to eat for us.</sentence><sentence id="225">Then the Germans took over the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> the same that the Russians had, and we start to work there again.</sentence><sentence id="226">But Ruzia was designed to clean the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, so she came a few times.</sentence><sentence id="227">She was so delicate, so very pretty, and she said as long as the child is here, and we took care as best we can.</sentence><sentence id="228">Mother didn't work anymore, and the <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span> was taken over by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="229">One day she just didn't come.</sentence><sentence id="230">One day just like the next day maybe came a Polish man.</sentence><sentence id="231">He was a conductor of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="233">0 he knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and he asked for Ava and I said I am Ava, and he said that my sister is going to be taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and she's so hungry.</sentence><sentence id="234">She would like to have a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="235">I asked him where they are going to march the whole group of people, and he told me.</sentence><sentence id="236">I took my armband off and went on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and stayed there while they were walking.</sentence><sentence id="237">The men looked like skeletons and they even picked up anything that was on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">Sometimes I wonder if it was even something from animals, everything.</sentence><sentence id="239">I saw Ruzia and I just run out and I don't know, there was a Ukrainian or some German Gestapo took my arm and they said and I said no, I'm Polish.</sentence><sentence id="240">I throwed the bread to her and she said please take care of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaynosh</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">I never saw her again.</sentence><sentence id="242">Then usually the German people used the young Jewish boy as the hatcher man.</sentence><sentence id="243">They were always the ones to select somebody or to take them somewhere and I know then from before or from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or something that we did together and at that time when it started to be so bad and one time I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and there were different <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and then I heard screaming like agony screaming, and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and there was a girl -- I don't know if she was 16 or 17, and she was profusely bleeding like you would think somebody had menstrual bleeding.</sentence><sentence id="244">She said, they raped me with the foot of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Then I heard other screaming and then a Polish superintendent of that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> came over and grabbed me by the hand and he pulled me down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and that's how I got acquainted with the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">Then, at that time, I know I have to do something with Mom and Gaynosh.</sentence><sentence id="247">I asked -- see in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> there was like a you have to go through a <span class="DLF">gate</span> where there were Germans and Ukrainians and the Jewish who were sort of going back and forth, the young men.</sentence><sentence id="248">At that time, I asked then if there was any possibility that I can get Gaynosh out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">They said how, and I said we just put something in his mouth and see and I spoke with that Sishko, that from <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span>, the director, and I was such a close friend with her, went together with her to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">I told her that I would like to Gaynosh to her aunt who was without children.</sentence><sentence id="251">Maybe she will raise him.</sentence><sentence id="252">She said let me talk.</sentence><sentence id="253">Then when I came for the beer and she said try it.</sentence><sentence id="254">I told her what day that would be and so with the armband -- you know there is like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> that you sit higher up and when you take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> there is like a <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> and the baby was</sentence><sentence id="256">1 around here and maybe in three months over a year I remember and just prior to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> I stuffed a little hanky in his mouth and then they stopped us and they said and I said I have to testify because I saw some Jewish people doing something wrong and they take me to headquarter.</sentence><sentence id="257">When we reach the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, they couldn't go near the <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span>, but they left me off and I held a shawl over my head and the baby and somebody from the back stopped me and I said "yeah," and he said where are you going and I said <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my baby.</sentence><sentence id="258">Who are you, I say 1am Polish.</sentence><sentence id="259">What is your <span class="BUILDING">religion</span>?</sentence><sentence id="260">I said <span class="BUILDING">catholic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">That's what I don't know so many things I was able to get away.</sentence><sentence id="262">I don't know how.</sentence><sentence id="263">I placed the baby at that time with them with the understanding that after the war somehow somewhere I will get the baby.</sentence><sentence id="264">Can I retreat?When I was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of , | had the baby and my mother and oh, by the way one time they come in the Germans and that one that was bedridden and just took her out like a piece of garbage, and she was gone, which was a blessing.</sentence><sentence id="265">Really, I could not lift her every day there was only me and Mom.</sentence><sentence id="266">There was no real life for her, but in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I didn't know it, but the neighbors who lived there for so many years, they know each other.</sentence><sentence id="267">One time a Jewish family came and said, you know there is a <span class="DLF">door</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">It was flush with the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, but there were <span class="DLF">steps</span> going down where evidently they pickled something for the winter, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="269">It was like <span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">Could we hide?</sentence><sentence id="271">Well, they said if they catch us, we're all going to be dead.</sentence><sentence id="272">Well, it got so bad that they started to round up people and take them out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, I had 15 people in that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> including my mom and Gaynosh.</sentence><sentence id="273">That was before.</sentence><sentence id="274">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I seen him sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="275">They came, not only that they came, 15 people, but there three children in the age of five to maybe nine and I was so afraid that they may cry or say something loud.</sentence><sentence id="276">So, I was upstairs and four or five Gestapo men say , everybody , and I said in German, there is nobody here, just me and my child.</sentence><sentence id="277">He said you go here you go there and they stuck the top on the thing and for me to tell them downstairs to sit quiet, I said, but there is no one here, but there is no one here.</sentence><sentence id="278">There was silence and then when the Gestapo grabbed Gaynosh and I said please don't do nothing to him and the other one said, let him sit we come some other time.</sentence><sentence id="281">2 Then he said are you sure you're Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="282">I said maybe not, but it didn't help me too much, but then he threw an apple, I thought he was going to kill the child, that was a good gesture, and some candies and they left.</sentence><sentence id="283">I asked once again, what a miracle.</sentence><sentence id="284">Then when I took out Gaynosh, I placed my mother with a neighbor that we used to live way back where my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="285">We didn't have much, but mama had such small little diamond earrings that evidently my father gave her when they were married.</sentence><sentence id="286">Don't forget that Ruzia was 2 and a half years older so they had some time together.</sentence><sentence id="287">I think her two rings and she wanted me to take it so I can survive.</sentence><sentence id="288">They say no, I want you to have that.</sentence><sentence id="289">Maybe at one time they will ask you to do that so they can buy food.</sentence><sentence id="290">So we made like a pouch in her dress that she had.</sentence><sentence id="291">We couldn't take too much with us.</sentence><sentence id="292">There were only two dresses that each one of us had and we sewed it underneath and that was what I left her.</sentence><sentence id="293">My heart was somehow easier because I took care of that.</sentence><sentence id="294">Then, that didn't give me too much time to really do something for myself.</sentence><sentence id="295">We were just taken in big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">So, I found myself there towards the end of "41, 42, and what one saw in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, it's really better to repress that.</sentence><sentence id="297">One time, of course they had I think it was recreation for them.</sentence><sentence id="298">Every time at night which were just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span>, no pillows, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheets</span>, no nothing, you just lie there, and roll calls.</sentence><sentence id="299">When it was snowing or raining or thundering that you put your feet like that and sit with your head down and then they would with the rifles would point out you go to your right, you go to your left, you go to your right.</sentence><sentence id="300">You never know which one <span class="NPIP">side</span> is better.</sentence><sentence id="301">Then one of them was to be just get away in some means.</sentence><sentence id="302">Sometimes they called it twice a night and then you had to get up at 5:00 to go to work.</sentence><sentence id="303">Then they would give you soup which you could find nothing in it.</sentence><sentence id="304">One time they put us there to -- let me say, when you came there, they shaved everyone.</sentence><sentence id="305">Q. This is 2 A. <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yanosko</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">They shaved us and then you hear this screaming because they asked everybody to open their mouths and they have like gold crowns, they just knocked it out, which was terribly painful.</sentence><sentence id="307">They just undress us.</sentence><sentence id="308">Men, women, children.</sentence><sentence id="309">It was almost unhuman.</sentence><sentence id="310">Then they pushed us to different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and when evening or at night when they built a fire and</sentence><sentence id="312">3 there like a which was like a heap and then they put a big fire and while we were sitting there, you could see the fire.</sentence><sentence id="313">It was not a recreational fire, it was quite a large <span class="REGION">area</span> and the flames were going up and with their rifles they were pointing to people giving them instructions to dress, to undress, whatever there was, one gown you were wearing and to throw himself on the burning.</sentence><sentence id="314">There was a mother and a daughter sitting near me.</sentence><sentence id="315">I don't think the daughter maybe was 14 or 15 years of age.</sentence><sentence id="316">He pointed out only to the mother and when the mother was still undressing, the daughter quickly got up and undressed and followed her, and many others perished the same way.</sentence><sentence id="317">Sometimes they would take us out and they would have those vicious dogs and when they found out that somebody was a rabbi, I remember one was a priest even who tried to hide the Jewish children, and pushed the dogs and you could see how the flesh was coming off these people.</sentence><sentence id="318">Sometimes they hang the people and the Jewish boys who were in control.</sentence><sentence id="319">I don't know if they could say no, sometimes I feel, and they were hanging there for us to see and then the Gestapo would say, you are the next.</sentence><sentence id="320">Just torturing, torturing us.</sentence><sentence id="321">One time in the roll call order were young people and the older people were sitting and the Ukrainian took -- her name was Bosha, took her out and we thought maybe he was going to save her, but when she came back she said he raped me and then he came and shot her.</sentence><sentence id="322">I had all her blood, you could everything from her brain.</sentence><sentence id="323">He shot her right here in the head.</sentence><sentence id="324">How can you have a very normal life when you think of that.</sentence><sentence id="325">One time I was selected to well asked to go and sort the clothing of the people who they still round up from different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">That was the only time that I had done that.</sentence><sentence id="327">That was the time that I found my mother's dress.</sentence><sentence id="328">I found the pouch.</sentence><sentence id="329">Of course there was nothing in it and I asked everybody if they came across Sabina Mueller and I looked at everybody who marched out to work.</sentence><sentence id="330">So, I don't know if they found her where she was hiding or if she was there and I never saw her because when I talked to my cousin in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, she was like 15 years younger than I, Mira said before I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limberg</span> and never saw her.</sentence><sentence id="331">It was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">At that time there was a Gestapo man who we know that he is sadist.</sentence><sentence id="333">He was choking people, especially young girls.</sentence><sentence id="334">One time he selected me to work in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to clean his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">His <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was like a stone away from the <span class="DLF">door</span> that rifles and Gestapo and everyone</sentence><sentence id="337">4 was watching when the people are going out, but the women were not going out anymore.</sentence><sentence id="338">So, one time, around that time, we were selected to help the men dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, and they said, this is not deep enough.</sentence><sentence id="339">The men were like skeletons, no food nothing.</sentence><sentence id="340">Then once again, right, left, right left.</sentence><sentence id="341">Then they put the men facing the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and then the music played, famous and the .</sentence><sentence id="342">That's how they buried the people or tortured them and the squadron shot the people, sometimes not enough to kill them and then they order to bury them.</sentence><sentence id="343">And you can hear the voices, help me help me and they were just buried alive.</sentence><sentence id="344">That time, I made up my mind if they shoot me that's okay.</sentence><sentence id="345">I spoke to the young man that you used to go with women and men out to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> to work.</sentence><sentence id="346">His name was Jacob.</sentence><sentence id="347">I said, you're coming to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I work for that Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="348">He never talked to me, he just said pointing that's not clean enough, but he never did anything to me.</sentence><sentence id="349">He never gave me food neither.</sentence><sentence id="350">But, this Jacob used to come and bring some cans of milk, which we didn't have it.</sentence><sentence id="351">I said do you think you can dream up a pair of pants.</sentence><sentence id="352">I would like to escape.</sentence><sentence id="353">I have a nephew.</sentence><sentence id="354">I have to take care of him.</sentence><sentence id="355">I promised my sister.</sentence><sentence id="356">He said gosh I don't know how I can do it.</sentence><sentence id="357">I said you bring that in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">Everybody is taller than you Ava.</sentence><sentence id="359">I said I will round it up, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="360">If they shoot me, they shoot me.</sentence><sentence id="361">I have nothing to lose.</sentence><sentence id="362">And one day he did it.</sentence><sentence id="363">He said 5:00 you have to drop into that row of people and just walk.</sentence><sentence id="364">Of course I did not look very much like a man, and maybe my walk was funny, but we were almost to get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> when they start, "halt, halt" and they recognize.</sentence><sentence id="365">I jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> and the conductor refused to stop.</sentence><sentence id="366">He saw that I was escaping and he went.</sentence><sentence id="367">Later on I have learned that he was shot because he come minus one, that Jacob.</sentence><sentence id="368">He was shot.</sentence><sentence id="369">It was also hard for me to live with that he somehow did it for me and he was not able to survive.</sentence><sentence id="370">That time they went to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where I sometimes went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where the women work before, remember I befriended myself with that superintendent.</sentence><sentence id="371">I went in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> all alone.</sentence><sentence id="372">I heard the voices.</sentence><sentence id="373">I bet they were rats.</sentence><sentence id="374">I was so scared, but my head was shaved.</sentence><sentence id="375">I couldn't go out, and I stayed there until they left that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, which was around 4:00 and I knew there was a telephone in some <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="376">I quickly wanted to call Sishka and I said I escaped.</sentence><sentence id="377">She said My God, am I going to take you.</sentence><sentence id="378">You're</sentence><sentence id="380">5 going to have to wait.</sentence><sentence id="381">I don't want to tell my mother.</sentence><sentence id="382">Maybe Stashu, her brother, will somehow pick you up and bring some clothing.</sentence><sentence id="383">Then I heard steps, and my heart stopped and that was the superintendent.</sentence><sentence id="384">He said what are you doing?</sentence><sentence id="385">I said I escaped, can you help me and he said my wife is not going to do that.</sentence><sentence id="386">Let me talk to her.</sentence><sentence id="387">He talked to her and she said here is soup.</sentence><sentence id="388">Eat the soup and go.</sentence><sentence id="389">Where would I go?</sentence><sentence id="390">Go back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="391">Let me just use your phone and I can tell her where I am.</sentence><sentence id="392">She did that, gave me a scarf so I can cover my head and then sometime it was very, very dark that they came and I jumped into there.</sentence><sentence id="393">They couldn't take me to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="394">They placed me in a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and they brought me some food.</sentence><sentence id="395">I think I stayed there for almost three and a half weeks, until my hair grew to something like you have, so I can go out.</sentence><sentence id="396">Sometime very late at night they would let me take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and that was a blessing.</sentence><sentence id="397">Tape 2 Q. Before we go on, I want to go back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="398">A. All right.</sentence><sentence id="399">Q. When you saw those people committing suicide, jumping out of -- did you ever think to yourself that you wanted to commit suicide?A. Not then.</sentence><sentence id="400">Not then.</sentence><sentence id="401">Suicide no.</sentence><sentence id="402">I just didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="403">When my mother and Gaynosh were taken there was a time when I didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="404">Only when I found mother's clothing and I knew that she was no longer alive, then I had that great desire to fulfill my promise to my sister.</sentence><sentence id="405">Because when they took her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I threw that bread if she caught it or not I will never know, and shear miracle that that Ukrainian or German let go of my arm and didn't pull me together through that marching group, I felt, I have to fulfill my promise to her.</sentence><sentence id="406">Suicide no, I'm just not geared to it.</sentence><sentence id="407">Q. Were you afraid of being raped?</sentence><sentence id="410">6 A. Yes, that I was.</sentence><sentence id="411">And by a very great miracle, even later on when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, where I will tell you from the point when I enlisted remind me to tell you about a very close call to rape and I will touch on that.</sentence><sentence id="412">I'm trying to do it sequence as possible.</sentence><sentence id="413">Have you have any other questions?Q. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="414">When you were escaping -- A. From the concentration camp?Q. From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but I want to ask you both about the escaping about taking your mother out, about taking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaynosh</span> out.</sentence><sentence id="415">It seems very brave to think about going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and taking the chance?A. It was not so brave.</sentence><sentence id="416">There was really guts and the will to do that.</sentence><sentence id="417">I was bringing really income to the family by going everyday out to the <span class="BUILDING">brewery</span>, taking my armband.</sentence><sentence id="418">Good, I was blonde and blue eyes as they say, but nevertheless it was going out, facing -- it was like two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="419"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was all Jewish the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was not.</sentence><sentence id="420">That was taking a chance.</sentence><sentence id="421">Walking through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and seeing them marching and looking at you and pretend that you are just hah-hah and you just smiling good day.</sentence><sentence id="422">That was brave.</sentence><sentence id="423">But then when they took my mother out, I didn't do it by myself because there I have the help once again of the Jewish boys who also took mother out to <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> and then she was going out to our <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="424">That was brave because where my father lived, we were known there.</sentence><sentence id="425">Where my grandfather lived, we were known there.</sentence><sentence id="426">She was there I don't know how long, but it must have been at least to that year that I found it unless they kept the clothing that long, but that was in the beginning of 1943.Q. How did you go out everyday, through the gate?A. No, through the other <span class="DLF">street</span> that was just a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and I was just making my way out because there was no wire in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="427">There were just <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">If you knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> you could just try to get out, and that's how I went almost every day.</sentence><sentence id="429">Q. Were you afraid?</sentence><sentence id="432">7 A.

around but that's all what it was it.</sentence><sentence id="758">Never called, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="759">It was hard to live being somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="760">It's not easy and especially when I was not recognized.</sentence><sentence id="761">I had to go on for the longest time to pretend, otherwise I was no one.</sentence><sentence id="762">But then, I decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">I had to find <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gaynosh</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">That was the whole

id="767">Q. What year was this?A. That was after the war "45, must be "46 before I even knew that was going to stop me.</sentence><sentence id="768">I went because there was a purpose, and they arrest me.</sentence><sentence id="769">One time, once again, that Yugoslavian, or was he Czechoslovakian, he took me from one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to the other and he spotted me just like he helped me with that

because they may arrest you and I cannot get you out.</sentence><sentence id="773">So, there was absolutely no way.</sentence><sentence id="774">Then I started to get in contact with the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="775">All the means that you can possibly think.</sentence><sentence id="776">When my husband, before he died went with me to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, I even went to made all the necessary information perhaps maybe they took the children to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but to no avail, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="777">So, the nicest thing, Joan, what happened to me was I thought I would not turn to Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="778">That was my first thought.</sentence><sentence id="779">I thought if I ever have a</sentence><sentence id="781">7 family, I would not like them to go through what I went through just because you were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="782">There was no other reason.</sentence><sentence id="783">As a matter fact, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Parochial schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="784">And I have in my family people who are today practicing Christianity, but then I knew a friend from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and she was married to a doctor at the same <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my future husband now was working, which was the <span class="BUILDING">University Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, where my husband was at that time, the last year resident already in the specialty of Radiology.</sentence><sentence id="785">They invite me to play tennis with them.</sentence><sentence id="786">I never possessed my own racket because my mother couldn't afford.</sentence><sentence id="787">My cousin was very well to do and she was tall 6 feet and from her clothing sometimes they made some dress for me, but we were always very close even though that she is closer to my sister's age, because I always told her the tricks when we came to visit her, as children.</sentence><sentence id="788">Her mother had governesses for her because nobody should blow on them and I always went .</sentence><sentence id="789">Iwas like Mitchell right now.</sentence><sentence id="790">Then, the family was not well to do but a very fine family of Milton Dorfman, and when I worked on <span class="DLF">Wall Street</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, at that time I interpreted German and Polish.</sentence><sentence id="791">I knew a little bit Russian, and the other girls were Polish and I at one time when Magda said why don't you come and her husband was .</sentence><sentence id="792">Her son is one of the very known and he's in music that music that you and I possibly don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="793">However, he is also a radiologist in <span class="REGION">Sausolito California</span>, and his father was the governor of <span class="REGION">Maine</span> and he was a very good friend of Milt, and we played tennis and I said, oh he's so slow.</sentence><sentence id="794">He's not going to play good tennis.</sentence><sentence id="795">Well, he played tennis.</sentence><sentence id="796">I was jumping, but he played tennis.</sentence><sentence id="797">Then, what attracted me was that so many other people wanted to take me out to <span class="BUILDING">Waldorf Austoria</span> or something and I was wondering what they would like to have in return for it, but Milt said we can have a hamburger or a hot dog and he always went like that because he was wearing a jacket from Maury, from his older brother.</sentence><sentence id="798">I just thought that's nice.</sentence><sentence id="799">Then I met him in 1948, very vaguely.</sentence><sentence id="800">That's what I wanted to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="801">Out of 35,000 people I was selected to be on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravan</span> of hope to bring my story and also there were two Israeli officers.</sentence><sentence id="802">I think I sent you a clipping, Joan, of it.</sentence><sentence id="803">At that time I spoke of it worse than I speak now.</sentence><sentence id="804">I had developed laryngitis and in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravan</span> of hope, we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utica</span>, which is really near where</sentence><sentence id="806">8 I live since 1954 when I came with my husband at that time.</sentence><sentence id="807">The people were very nice.</sentence><sentence id="808">They tried to .</sentence><sentence id="809">Inever knew what that is, but they were very friendly and I spot that.</sentence><sentence id="810">That was in 1948, memories it was very hard to remember everything, and I even forgot that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span>.</sentence><sentence id="811">When I sent you the clippings I said I was looking for some papers, and by coincident I had the clippings from <span class="REGION">Springfield Massachusetts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="812">Joan, if I wouldn't see my picture in that article, I cannot recall that I was in <span class="REGION">Springfield Massachusetts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="813">No way.</sentence><sentence id="814">I remember I was in <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> because over there they once again, pretty girl with blue eyes and I always thought I had green eyes, said now Ava Gardner will speak to us.</sentence><sentence id="815">Of course I don't know who is Ava Gardner.</sentence><sentence id="816">I didn't see any movies, and I waited and they started to laugh.</sentence><sentence id="817">It's me.</sentence><sentence id="818">So, right now, before I came here.</sentence><sentence id="819">I tried to contact the Utica Observer Dispatch, which is a newspaper, and they told me that if it's "48 or "49 it would be on microfilm in the <span class="BUILDING">public library</span>, which I got the clipping that I showed you.</sentence><sentence id="820">Then I called the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">University of Syracuse</span>, and they send me a clipping which I showed you.</sentence><sentence id="821">They were one of the soldiers of the officers was the nephew of the President to the Israeli state of , and the other one lost both legs because I think that was the time that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> gained independence in 1948 or "49.</sentence><sentence id="822">So, at that time I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">caravan</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hope</span> and the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> that stayed out in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="823">I had always that same blouse that you have the picture.</sentence><sentence id="824">I did not acquire anything else, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">I don't remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> but I remember the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="826">There was also a big philanthropist from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , who when we got married, put carpet in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he remember me from the Caravan of Hope.</sentence><sentence id="827">He still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>.</sentence><sentence id="828">He's a great contributor to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">At that time I asked the elevator girl because that was the only category I could afford to have maybe what she wears.</sentence><sentence id="830">If after work she can take me and I can get another blouse because I still have to go further.</sentence><sentence id="831">She said I can't go with you.</sentence><sentence id="832">I said is it because I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="833">I said why.</sentence><sentence id="834">She said, because I cannot ride in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that you are.</sentence><sentence id="835">I said why not?</sentence><sentence id="836">She said, because I'm black.</sentence><sentence id="837">At that time I think, I'd like to go back, because there couldn't be anything worse at the time to go from one oppression and find that I came to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that is free and have that.</sentence><sentence id="838">Who's next I said to myself.</sentence><sentence id="839">That made a very big</sentence><sentence id="841">9 impression on me and that's how I know I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span>.</sentence><sentence id="842">But nothing of that sort happened in <span class="REGION">Springfield Massachusetts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="843">Q. What was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Caravan</span> of Hope?A. <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Caravan</span> of Hope was primary to bring to the attention what happened with the Jewish people and speaking about my , my experiences and for the Israeli soldiers or officers to raise money for the UGA because a portion would be to save the children who came from Holocaust or other displaced families, and to raise money on all the stops.</sentence><sentence id="844">Then after I came from <span class="BUILDING">Caravan of Hope</span>, my husband at that time was just courting me, asked me if we can see each other again.</sentence><sentence id="845">He's a very fine person, never never speaking about himself.</sentence><sentence id="846">That's when I met his doctor McKenzie and he was just in the last year of radiology, a resident, a doctor came in and he asked Doctor McKenzie to look over the pictures, the x-rays and he said whatever Doctor Dorfman will say, that is the diagnosis, which I highly thought of.</sentence><sentence id="847">He asked me to go to a dinner to his family.</sentence><sentence id="848">I told him, he asked me if eventually we can marry, and I said if your family wouldn't like me, I wouldn't marry you, because I really need a family.</sentence><sentence id="849">I meant it.</sentence><sentence id="850">So, we went there.</sentence><sentence id="851">It was a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="852">The father worked at 70 years of age because he was a self taught person to design dresses.</sentence><sentence id="853">They called him back at that age because he was so good, and he always said to Mama, you wear this dress funny when I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="854">It was a wonderful family, but when I came there once again, long hair I heard her brother, Uncle Abe saying, nice girl, too bad she isn't Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="855">That followed me all the time.</sentence><sentence id="856">So, I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I said, but she is.</sentence><sentence id="857">He was just so happy about it.</sentence><sentence id="858">Then in 1949, Christmas day, a Professor , who still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, who was the Chief of Radiology, lent us the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span>, which was so called.</sentence><sentence id="859">Then he took a position in Des Moines Iowa and that's where my both boys were born in a <span class="BUILDING">Methodist Hospital</span>, and we had the circumcision right there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because the family was so far away that nobody came for it.</sentence><sentence id="860">Then, my husband really wanted to be closer to the family and at that time -- I enjoyed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Des Moines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="861">There was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Reform</span>, and there was evening sermons were very nice and educational.</sentence><sentence id="862">They spoke about everything and about the Holocaust, but then he was</sentence><sentence id="864">0 offered a position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, which he didn't want to be in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> not to raise the children there.</sentence><sentence id="865">Then there was a position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">We didn't know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> was horrible at that time.</sentence><sentence id="867">I couldn't believe that I lived there.</sentence><sentence id="868">Then my cousin came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> she said this is a slow death.</sentence><sentence id="869">Why are you living here.</sentence><sentence id="870">We don't even have a movie.</sentence><sentence id="871">We have to travel 20 miles to a movie.</sentence><sentence id="872">But a close knit family, and if you are part of the society or the community then you grow closer.</sentence><sentence id="873">My husband was chosen among 14 other radiologist one of them Jerry Segal, who is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utica</span> right now, and is glad that he didn't take it, because there is very anti-semitic, a restricted golf club, and my husband never delved into what is going on, so when they proposed to him, he said fine I like to play golf but then when he found out that we would be the only ones, he felt very bad.</sentence><sentence id="874">Later we learned that three voices were against only because he was Jewish and the vice president of the , Charlie Getty, who is a very good friend of ours, said I will have to resign.</sentence><sentence id="875">Because if we can't have a fine person like Milt, we should be lucky that he wants to join.</sentence><sentence id="876">This is how I joined the Club, which I was the only one but at that time Rabbi, who is now living in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>, Rabbi Weimer said maybe there will be opening.</sentence><sentence id="877">But they until today they think Milt is Jewish and I'm not.</sentence><sentence id="878">And Joan, I don't want to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="879">I feel that I'm still having problems with it because one time I was asked what I am and then when I was Jewish that was no good.</sentence><sentence id="880">When I was non- Jewish that was no good, so when they asked me I just said I believe that I do things other human beings and that is the greatest religion what you can do, serve the fellow man.</sentence><sentence id="881">So, lots of people think that I married Milt that he's Jewish, I'm not Jewish and I don't try one way or the other way to correct it.</sentence><sentence id="882">It's immaterial to me.</sentence><sentence id="883">Both my children were bar mitzvah, went to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, and Gary right now I have two sons.</sentence><sentence id="884">One is Gary, one is Mitchell.</sentence><sentence id="885">They are also two years apart.</sentence><sentence id="886">Both born in May.</sentence><sentence id="887">Gary is a professor of Radiology where he is lecturing at the <span class="BUILDING">Medical School</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brown</span> and is chief of the department and that's also recently president of the Cardiovascular Society for the whole <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and spoke recently in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="888">But above everything, very good son.</sentence><sentence id="889"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mitchell</span> is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">He's with the New York State Mental Health and he is a psychologist.</sentence><sentence id="891">He got his masters and hopes one day to get his doctorate</sentence><sentence id="893">1 degree.</sentence><sentence id="894">However, once again tragedy struck and we have been married 39 years and children start to make preparation for our 40th wedding anniversary and on the fourth of July 1988, Gary and his family we pick them up at the <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse Airport</span> with their little daughter who was 2 1/2 or three years old and we went to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="895">We had a wonderful Saturday, that same day.</sentence><sentence id="896">I had some people for dessert in the evening, and my husband said, well it's late but we don't have to get up next morning, Sunday, so early.</sentence><sentence id="897">He never woke up.</sentence><sentence id="898">I found him sitting in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> gone.</sentence><sentence id="901">2 Tape 3 Q. Ava you were talking about the loss of your husband and how important he was to you.</sentence><sentence id="902">A. Well, he was not only a husband, he was a true friend and I didn't speak about my experiences but only with Milt.</sentence><sentence id="903">He was a very kind and understanding person.</sentence><sentence id="904">I know that the patients former patients of his are still saying when Doctor Dorfman was here they must have thrown away the mold, how the saying goes.</sentence><sentence id="905">There isn't a kinder person that you can feel like at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> especially when you have <span class="BUILDING">radiology</span>.</sentence><sentence id="906">You go into that big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> you need somebody.</sentence><sentence id="907">At night evidently I had very bad dreams and sometimes I'd say don't let them take me.</sentence><sentence id="908">I had to explain to him what I meant.</sentence><sentence id="909">But one time I think when Gary was around 17 or 18, he was just to graduate from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, my husband was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="910">That was the only one.</sentence><sentence id="911">He was on very minimal medications and everything was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="912">As a matter of fact, that fourth of July when the children came to visit us, Gary could not come very often because he is so busy.</sentence><sentence id="913">It was only because ten days later we were supposed to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Alaska</span> where I was taking a group of Senior citizens, and he and Doctor Brown who is on the picture with with me and his wife were supposed to go together.</sentence><sentence id="914">Gary persuaded me that I should take the trip in that short time because I didn't sit shiva.</sentence><sentence id="915">There was only one night and they were laughing and making jokes, the man that supposed to get you out of --- I just couldn't stand it.</sentence><sentence id="916">I just said no.</sentence><sentence id="917">Mitchell had to go back to work and Gary stayed with me and then went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> until he placed me on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="918">Of course I don't remember anything about <span class="COUNTRY">Alaska</span>.</sentence><sentence id="919">I cried and cried and Doctor Brown tried to give me some sedative and I'm anti-mediation so I just suffer without being calmed down.</sentence><sentence id="920">Every time they said you have to eat something and I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="921">That's the time I lost 17 pounds which I never regained.</sentence><sentence id="922">It was a shock, just a shock because we were together and on Sunday just to find him just --- I took his head and I said, we call each other babe, not Milt or Ava was not known and everybody called him -- my cousin writes letters "how is baby?"</sentence><sentence id="923">So, I said babe you can take and I stopped because he was cold, and the friend of ours who is the publisher of the paper he still says he</sentence><sentence id="925">3 remembers when I said "He's so cold, he's so cold."</sentence><sentence id="926">I was in shock.</sentence><sentence id="927">They didn't know if I'm going to get out, but they used to have a friendly poker game every Friday in the Sentinel which is our newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="928">When Milt died, they never resumed it.</sentence><sentence id="929">George Waters and Shirley said, George doesn't face anyone without Milt.</sentence><sentence id="930">He was very recognized professionally.</sentence><sentence id="931">He was president of the whole Society, not only locally but for the <span class="REGION">New York State</span>.</sentence><sentence id="932">He was a very good , was a wonderful husband and friend, and a wonderful father.</sentence><sentence id="933">When you read the clippings, which maybe I left you, he did volunteer radiology for the DDSO,

One last story.</sentence><sentence id="1010">When you were waiting to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you were waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called the Lillymarlane?A. From .</sentence><sentence id="1011">At that time there was a strike an they could not move the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> at that time from <span

said -- no they came and told us we have to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> because that's where our <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> because I remember that Anna and Henry were there, I was here.</sentence><sentence id="1013">They came and once again Germans clean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> and Henry went.</sentence><sentence id="1014">He was an attorney.</sentence><sentence id="1015">He went and cleaned for Anna too.</sentence><sentence id="1016">I said I wouldn't do that, and the German looked at me and said yes you would and I said No I won't.</sentence><sentence id="1017">Henry pleaded with me in Polish, you are so close to a new life, don't be stubborn, go clean.</sentence><sentence id="1018">I wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1019">I just wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1020">So, they took me to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> where there was other military person just with a shirt not with that straps and I told him that I had to succumb to anything they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1021">After the war I don't feel like I want to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1022">He said, he looked at me, he sat there and looked at me and he said but don't you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and start a new life.</sentence><sentence id="1023">I said yes, but that doesn't mean that i have to clean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1024">He said I'm from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1025">They were not very much better, but I told him that I lived</sentence><sentence id="1027">7 there and he said, well, why don't you don

again.</sentence><sentence id="1033">Well, won or not won, it was degrading to me after the war that they had to do once again that dirty job.</sentence><sentence id="1034">But, as they said when I came here it was not so easy neither because the cousin of my mother had an aunt from his wife's side.</sentence><sentence id="1035">We never knew and he was on vacation when I came.</sentence><sentence id="1036">He came in July and he was with the children Sadell and Julius and he asked me to be with that aunt.</sentence><sentence id="1037">Very uneducated and she had a daughter Molly and Molly came in and asked me how the dress looks on her.</sentence><sentence id="1038">I was always and I said not so good.</sentence><sentence id="1039">They didn't know that in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> you always say oh nice lovely and she felt that that was very offensive to her.</sentence><sentence id="1040">At one point she said, hatred did not do that to the Jews in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> so it must have been that God wanted it this way.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Well, that was the end.</sentence><sentence id="1042">I just took my things and found out that the Doctor Heller from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and Rudy were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and then they asked me come and live with them.</sentence><sentence id="1043">From there when I started to work at <span class="BUILDING">Wall Street</span> with the <span class="BUILDING">Polish bank</span> I lived with a Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="1044">That's what I want to tell you about, Ann Remler, Zigmund's sister.</sentence><sentence id="1045">I lived on <span class="DLF">Ocean Avenue</span> and I

that time I made a promise to my sister's father --in-law.</sentence><sentence id="1048">He had a daughter who studied medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and I only know that she married an American medical student.</sentence><sentence id="1049">I know that she was Anna Silver, but I didn't know who she married.</sentence><sentence id="1050">So when I was -- that was before I married my husband, but we were seeing each other.</sentence><sentence id="1051">I went to the New York Times and spoke to a then reporter who was very known, Charlie Grutzner, told him that I'm looking for Anna Sabol who married an American, at that time student and they're married and they live right here.</sentence><sentence id="1052">They are in <span class="BUILDING">psychiatry</span> maybe.</sentence><sentence id="1053">So, in <span class="BUILDING">Bellview Hospital</span> some other doctor said, Anna I think they are searching for you.</sentence><sentence id="1054">She said maybe they're somebody crazy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bellview</span> and they found out my name, but they came to the <span class="BUILDING">restitution office</span> and we met.</sentence><sentence id="1055">They were both psychiatrists and their two sons came to that people that I lived there.</sentence><sentence id="1056">That's why I remember</sentence><sentence id="1058">8 there was a Time Magazine and they had an article just around the corner because they lived just around the corner.</sentence><sentence id="1059">She asked me that she's very sorry that she would like to help me, to give me anything they wanted and I said no.</sentence><sentence id="1060">You could have saved your family and maybe us, but you asked Zigmund only to come and leave Ruzia and her little boy alone and your family said Shiva and tore his garment and he wants you to know that.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Then she called my sister-in-law Blanche how she can get me.</sentence><sentence id="1062">They tried very hard then I married and I said I don't want anything from them.</sentence><sentence id="1063">But one time I was maybe, a year ago, that's how I find I said to Mitchell in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, you know I wonder if she is still alive because she had a practice and this is the time that we found in the telephone book .</sentence><sentence id="1064">I said it doesn't say Doctor, so he said well why don't you call and ask, so he called and he spoke and they said yes, which Remler and he said Doctor Remler and he said who you are and he said I'll let you speak to my mother and that proved to me he was the brother of Doctor Remler, of her husband and I understand that he was killed in an accident with his younger son and Anna since then has passed away, but they have a son who is in William and Mary, a Professor and one is a surgeon in <span class="REGION">California</span> somewhere but I called that William and Mary and he told me that do you know that brother of Zigmund Hiney is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Vegas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1065">So, see what happens after 50 years.</sentence><sentence id="1066">Q. You recently told, and we'll do this shortly, your son Gary about your first marriage.</sentence><sentence id="1067">A. Gary visited me by himself without the family.</sentence><sentence id="1068">I don't know how the conversation went, but I didn't see too much of his daughter and I thought that Vicki herself could come sometime but she's typical <span class="REGION">New England</span>, very reserved and she doesn't feel comfortable to come without him, and I said just to hold her in my arms and that's what brought out and I told him.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I as a mother sense that it made adverse impression on him.</sentence><sentence id="1070">Why didn't you tell us.</sentence><sentence id="1071">I said that was a decision between Daddy and I and I was only married seven months.</sentence><sentence id="1072">I don't even know if I was married.</sentence><sentence id="1073">It didn't make any impression.</sentence><sentence id="1074">I didn't even have time to adjust myself.</sentence><sentence id="1075">The child also, three months, I just didn't and I thought you should know.</sentence><sentence id="1076">I always thought I was the first born.</sentence><sentence id="1077">I said you are of a lasting marriage of 39 years Gary and I spent so much time with you in sickness and in happiness and he said are you going to tell Mitchell.</sentence><sentence id="1078">I said, with time, with time,</sentence><sentence id="1080">9 when it's going to be the proper time.</sentence><sentence id="1081">And I think I will do when I visit Mitchell at the end of this month as I'm going to the Survivors of the Holocaust they are having gathering in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1082">It's not going to be easy, and this is why maybe a whole year that you are trying to make contact, I didn't want to say something that it's not accurate, and it will take me a long time to return to be half normal.</sentence><sentence id="1083">I cannot ever be normal life.</sentence><sentence id="1084">In the beginning we didn't have too much, but then we're comfortable, and I still would not spend on me to buy a suit unless I'm pressed to it, but I would donate $5,000 to a cause if it would be for a good reason.</sentence><sentence id="1085">It's hard when you eat dinner and remember my sister saying that she's hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1086">You don't forget that.</sentence><sentence id="1087">You can keep on the bottom somewhere in your memory but it stays with you.</sentence><sentence id="1088">Any my mother now that I'm definitely over 42 and I realize that 42 is very young,
