<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="109">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="110">Well, I -- you know, I -- I do like classical music a lot, and always have, and I love the human voice, this is why I love opera.</sentence><sentence id="111">But I adore Chopin, and if you ask me to make a list of composers that I adore, from the top my first is Chopin -- not Victor's, he | -- he likes him, too, but he prefers Tchaikovsky, but Chopin to me is everything.</sentence><sentence id="112">There's such delicacy in his piano playing, and there's such soul, plus the fact that a lot of his music was set to -- was made into songs in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">In fact, I have a record here, it says [indecipherable] that's complete works of Chopin as they were set to music.</sentence><sentence id="114">There are some baritone male voices, and sopranos.</sentence><sentence id="115">And actually -- this is</sentence><sentence id="117">Interview with Regina Gelb " March 23, 2001 a record I bought while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but actually, I know about 80 percent of these songs, because as a child I learned them.</sentence><sentence id="118">You know, when you learn -- when you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you have -- in those days, children were taught to sing.</sentence><sentence id="119">Well, you were taught also quite often, some of these songs, which at that time I didn't know they were Chopin, they were just beautiful songs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: You can just start any <span class="NPIP">time</span> you want to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: You asked me about the pictures of my family from before the war.</sentence><sentence id="136">Of course I have them, and it isn't because I -- I took them out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, no.</sentence><sentence id="137">They were sent to us from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because my mother was quite involved with training the pioneers for pi -- and for pioneering in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and subsequently these people settled in the old <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and my parents used to send them pictures.</sentence><sentence id="138">Well, after the war, we were very, very lucky that some of these people whom we located, gave us some of the pictures of -- from my childhood, which I would otherwise never have.</sentence><sentence id="139">So what I do have in my album, and of course I also have it as a painting, which I had done out of these pictures, a picture of my parents as mature people, and a picture of my parents as -- as an engaged couple.</sentence><sentence id="140">And you could see how charming that looks, it's a sort of an old fashioned kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="141">Mother has a big bow in the back, and they both wear a pince-nez.</sentence><sentence id="142">And my father has one of these stand-up collars, sort of like a 19" century fashion.</sentence><sentence id="143">Very charming and I'm delighted to have those.</sentence><sentence id="144">Then we have a picture of my father, one of them is -- he's sort of posing, you could see, obviously this was posed in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="147">the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> against a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">And it's very official, and rather proper.</sentence><sentence id="149">And then there's one more relaxed, sort of like a -- well, basic portrait type of a picture.</sentence><sentence id="150">And then I have this group picture of my grandmother on my mother's side, whose name was Sarah Tanenbloom.</sentence><sentence id="151">And I think I mentioned somewhere in the rec --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="152">Q: I don't recall.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: This group picture is with my mother's side of the family.</sentence><sentence id="154">Basically, my grandmother is in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="155">Since she was religious, you could see she's wearing a wig.</sentence><sentence id="156">To her left is my mother, holding my oldest sister, Anna -- Hanya.</sentence><sentence id="157">Of course, I wasn't around yet for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="158">On the other side of Grandma is my Aunt Anja and above in <span class="DLF">second line</span> you have my father's sister.</sentence><sentence id="159">This is, I think, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">Then is my mother's youngest sister, Ruja, my father, my Aunt Regina, my father's sister, I think this is Frania, and this completes the picture.</sentence><sentence id="161">And that was taken somewhere in the 20's and -- ni -- 1920's.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I'm so happy to have this picture, of course, I made copies for my sisters and my kids.</sentence><sentence id="163">So we're very lucky to have that.</sentence><sentence id="164">And here is my mother as a very young girl, with my -- with -- with her brother.</sentence><sentence id="165">And it also has to be taken somewhere in a -- in a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span>, and it makes me laugh when I look at those poses, but this is also charming, lovely.</sentence><sentence id="166">I also have a very interesting picture of myself here with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I -- I sort of have a severe look on my face, and -- and I am sitting there with a little cane.</sentence><sentence id="168">The reason is that this is a picture of my fa -- of my mother in one of the -- she used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> for -- for her arthritis, and she had to</sentence></p><p><sentence id="171">have a cane, obviously she was suffering.</sentence><sentence id="172">So apparently she bought me a little cane.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="173">And I'm sitting on the -- on the -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, and my mother is standing next to me, and of course I look the way I always did, with the big, thick hair, and a bow in the head -- hair, holding a cane.</sentence><sentence id="174">And next to it I also have a picture of my sister Chris, Chrisha, with my mother, also at that -- at that <span class="BUILDING">spa</span>, which was the -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> -- the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">sulphur baths</span> were actually located inside a <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">And this is outside the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">The -- the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buskos Druey</span>, it was in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="177">Mother used to go there annually for her arthritis.</sentence><sentence id="178">Let -- let me make sure I know who is who.</sentence><sentence id="179">This is Regina, this is Ruja, this is Anja, this is Moish, those are the two sons.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="180">Yes, okay, just a second.</sentence><sentence id="181">Oh, I've got it written down, all the sisters were standing there, sister Regina, this is Regina, this one.</sentence><sentence id="182">Brother Moish, sister Anja, brother Nokrun in there.</sentence><sentence id="183">Sister Ruja, that's -- I had it the opposite way, I'm looking at it li -- and the Kronenburg boys, Bernard and Henrick, okay.</sentence><sentence id="184">Here is another picture which I have, which shows my mother's side of the family, which was quite extensive, because there were nine children, and when they grew up, of course they all had children, so the family was very large.</sentence><sentence id="185">In this picture I have my mother's oldest sister, Fela Kronenberg with her husband.</sentence><sentence id="186">My mother's sister, Anja, Regina and Ruja.</sentence><sentence id="187">My mother's brother Moish, and the Kronenberg's two sons, whose name was Bernard and Henrick.</sentence><sentence id="188">And of course, except for my Uncle Moish, who emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, this -- everybody in this picture went -- was an-annihilated in -- in the Holocaust, plus</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="192">Interview with Regina Gelb a March 23, 2001 -- and this is only one daughter, now just multiply it by nine, and you will get the idea of how many people in that family perished in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="193">My father's brother, who survived the war, this was right after the war.</sentence><sentence id="194">So let me see, and after this is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="195">Well, here is one more picture, we call it the classic, quote unquote, because we are lined up, posed again as all those pictures were in those years, the three sisters.</sentence><sentence id="196">The oldest sister Anna -- Hanya, the middle sister Chrisha, Chris, and myself, Renia, Regina.</sentence><sentence id="197">We lined up and our kids always laugh at this picture, and they make us -- we -- of course, we are a very close family, we always have been extremely close, and -- and because we survived the war together, and -- and the fact that we were never separated during the war, which is almost incredible.</sentence><sentence id="198">It just absolutely was a miraculous thing that we were never separated.</sentence><sentence id="199">We were very close then, and we are very close now, and so are our kids.</sentence><sentence id="200">So our kids always laugh when they remember this picture, because this is the family classic.</sentence><sentence id="201">And throughout the years, whenever we have big of -- family occasions, weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, Seders, they make us line up.</sentence><sentence id="202">And I can show you though the years, I have pictures of the three of us lined up in the exact <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">We have to stand, and we have to stand there like the <span class="DLF">steps</span>, except now we are not <span class="DLF">steps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">In those days one was biggest, one was middle, one was small.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">Now we're sort of varied in size, and we, of course, gotten so much older, too.</sentence><sentence id="206">But the point is that I have pictures through the years, in the same arrangement as this classic picture, so that this is just for the joke of it, and every album that you look through, as</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="210">Interview with Regina Gelb " March 23, 2001 I have them all lined up, you will always find a picture of the three sisters lined up in that fashion.</sentence><sentence id="211">You know, I look at these albums now, and I remember [indecipherable] them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, which was a part of our -- that's where our outings wer -- took place, because we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlactensee</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">And as I look at these pictures with my friends, one of it has the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in the background.</sentence><sentence id="213">Gives you an idea that this was only one year after the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="214">But we look like real schoolgirls out for a good time.</sentence><sentence id="215">And we had a very -- I always talk about the experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> as one of the nicest, because I was really still a child, and there was every effort made to have all the children who were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that time, to have those children come back to the life of a child.</sentence><sentence id="216">Of course, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> established, and -- because children were coming in at all ages, and with all educational backgrounds, we were sorted out, so to say, by age, because this was primarily a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>, even though the subjects were -- the curriculum was like any other <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, except it was all in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="217">And basically the kids who went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> really, truly identified with the group, even though some of the children were orphans and came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with cousins or others.</sentence><sentence id="218">Some were children with parents who came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, for example.</sentence><sentence id="219">I had one friend, Tunia, who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and she was my age, and she was in that class.</sentence><sentence id="220">Now we had, in addition -- in -- in addition to having courses, we were also given a special <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> where we will go -- we all attended, we all had special lunches, and of course we always had chocolate.</sentence><sentence id="221">And in the evenings we went</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="225">Interview with Regina Gelb " March 23, 2001 for dances.</sentence><sentence id="226">I don't think it was every evening, it was probably about once or twice a week.</sentence><sentence id="227">And over there we could already mix with the what you call grown-up group, because after all, we were -- I ha -- I was among the group that was the oldest, and we weren't even what you call grown people yet.</sentence><sentence id="228">But over there the boys were lovely, and they were a little older, but they didn't mind dancing with girls who are younger but knew how to dance, and there was an orchestra.</sentence><sentence id="229">And the music played -- I now realize, when I hear some of it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- not now, but years ago when they used to play that, that the music that was very popular in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the 30's was what was played by these dancing -- dancing -- dance bands for us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlactensee</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">And lo and behold, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I heard those songs again, except they said, oh, these songs are old, and Nat King Cole will sing it, or other popular entertainer singers of the time.</sentence><sentence id="231">And of course, to this day, every time somebody plays very old records, and they play one of those, I never associate it with <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, because I really learned it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: Do you remember one?</sentence><sentence id="234">Sing -- sing one, or s -- hum it a little bit.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Oh yes, of course, my voice isn't there, but I remember this one song, "Kiss me once, and kiss me twice, and kiss me once again.</sentence><sentence id="236">It's been a long, long, time."</sentence><sentence id="237">I'm sorry, I can't sing cause I just had a cold, so I have a scratchy voice.</sentence><sentence id="238">Anyhow, I have here these different boys that I used to dance with, and of course group pictures with others, and it's -- it's really just wonderful with -- we seem to be having a very great,</sentence><sentence id="240">Interview with Regina Gelb 8 March 23, 2001 wonderful time, which we did.</sentence><sentence id="241">Because I really remember all this with great affection, and how -- what a nice relationships we all established with the boys.</sentence><sentence id="242">I mean, each one of us, the group of girls that I was close to, and there were four of us that were very close at that time, and we had a relationship with boys that was really lovely, it was friendly, and it -- it was really -- it was just -- just -- just -- just nice.</sentence><sentence id="243">I have a few pictures of the four of us here, and three of us remain very close.</sentence><sentence id="244">Actually, all four except unfortunately two of us are gone -- we're gone now.</sentence><sentence id="245">And in fact, I have a picture much later on, that I might show you, when we took a -- the four of us got together, and we have a picture like

number of years ago I translated, "The Shoemakers," a play by Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, which was supposed to be pre-presented at LaMama, they ran out of funds, so they only ended up with a reading.</sentence><sentence id="913">But the play has been around for a while, and it was presented at <span class="BUILDING">Wesleyan University</span> last spring.</sentence><sentence id="914">In fact, it was April 28", at <span class="BUILDING">Wesleyan</span> in my -- my translation of -- of the Witkiewicz -- Witkiewicz play, and Victor and I were invited, and it was just very nice.</sentence><sentence id="915">We were introduced to the actors and they asked me about the background of Witkiewicz, the -- the -- the playwrights background, and of course, this is an avant-garde play, so it can be produced in different ways, but it really must be understood for what it is, because it was written i -- during the interwar period.</sentence><sentence id="916">And witki -- Witkiewicz was an avant-garde playwright who didn't quite fit the times yet, but he became the rage after the war.</sentence><sentence id="917">And I don't mean in communist Poland, but in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, for example, and wherever else -- he was translated into other languages.</sentence><sentence id="918">And he committed suicide by the way, in 1939, as the Russians were approaching.</sentence><sentence id="919">He was running east when the Germans entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and when he saw the Russians coming his way, he committed suicide on -- on road east.</sentence><sentence id="920">But anyhow, his <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- of</sentence><sentence id="922">Interview with Regina Gelb * March 23, 2001 course, he was considered the lunatic type, but he was the most educated man and a great playwright, and great, fantastic painter of -- of modern art.</sentence><sentence id="923">I have a number of -- of his books of -- of paintings.</sentence><sentence id="924">Of course, he took every conceivable drug, peyote, and cocaine and all that, and he wrote and painted under the influence.</sentence><sentence id="925">Aside from which, he was not in tune with anything that went on in the 30's, during his productive years, so that he was an oddball, and everybody said he was crazy, of course.</sentence><sentence id="926">But now, not only are si -- his paintings most valuable, but his work has come into its own, because now you can really see he -- for example, this play "Szewcy," which is "Shoemakers," really discusses the end of the world, sort of, you know, when the -- when the -- the -- the world is going to be taken over by the automatons, but of course this is supposed to be a comedy, but it isn't.</sentence><sentence id="927">But it is really, truly a great piece of work, so I was very pleased when we were invited.</sentence><sentence id="928">And it was so well produced, you know, I must tell you that I only think that professional, big professional company could do justice to Witkiewicz, because you must understand what he was talking about.</sentence><sentence id="929">Well, I was so impressed by the Wesleyan production, I truly cannot begin to tell you, not just the -- the way it was produced, and the way it was presented -- and these were actually students, they were -- they do have a -- a drama department, so these were students from the drama department.</sentence><sentence id="930">But how it was presented for what it is, in other words, it wasn't cut, it wasn't altered, it wasn't anything, it was just pure Witkiewicz.</sentence><sentence id="931">It was fantastic and I loved it, so I was very happy to see that -- to see it, and -- and that was</sentence><sentence id="933">Interview with Regina Gelb * March 23, 2001 just a year ago.</sentence><sentence id="934">Also for the -- onto the projects which I completed between the time I saw you last and now, I have translated in -- completed in 1998, a book translated from Polish into English, "Krakow Ghetto Diaries and Poems."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1159">Q: A lot of -- a lot of people, especially Holocaust survivors actually had a very strong response to what happened in the 50's in the so called McCarthy era.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Could you just say a little bit -- something about your impressions from that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1163">A: Well, I was more or less getting used to the idea that American democracy was really based on different opinions and different actions of people, that nothing was getting resolved in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the way things were resolved in the political system that I grew up in, where you went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for this, and -- and you did some other political misdeed, and -- and you -- you had to pay for that, because you had to toe the -- the -- the government approach to -- to -- to -- to -- to ruling, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="1164">Now, having been a child in the interwar period, I wasn't quite aware of all the things that did go on, and I know a lot did, because I do know that there was a famous <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> called <span class="BUILDING" lat="52.55" long="24.966666">Bereza Kartuska</span>, where people who were communists were being sent, because apparently there was some ferment in the Polish society in the interwar periods -- period.</sentence><sentence id="1165">Well, I -- I knew Bereza Kartuska and I knew people were sent there, but I never made the connection.</sentence><sentence id="1166">When I finally lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and realized what a fantastic system of government democracy is, allowing for freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and -- and -- and total freedom that you didn't have to account to</sentence><sentence id="1168">4 Interview with Regina Gelb March 23, 2001 anybody for where you going or what you are doing.</sentence><sentence id="1169">That all of a sudden -- and now I was already after <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and I -- having studied political science and such, I had the idea of what American democracy was about.</sentence><sentence id="1170">But I really never saw the other side of the coin, where certain excesses that are committed in the society cannot be solved the way they were solved in Europe, the way I understood it, by simply acting on it right then and there, because this is a country of law, and everything has to percolate through the legal system.</sentence><sentence id="1171">MeCarthy's excesses were so obvious to everybody, even to people who did not think that there was a communist under every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, spying, and that every liberal in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was a communist.</sentence><sentence id="1172">There were people who had leftist leanings and didn't act on them, but that was just their philosophy of life.</sentence><sentence id="1173">There were -- "m sure there were spies, as there always are, and I'm sure there were people who were organizing in leftist groups.</sentence><sentence id="1174">But when the McCarthy era came and I realized that it had to take its course, to go through the leg -- legal system.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And to me it was entirely too long, and it really got me very upset.</sentence><sentence id="1176">Eventually, of course, it was solved and I was very happy to see that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1193">Q: Now, there was another era when you got a little upset, or even a little more upset, and that was in the -- in the 60's, there was the -- the counter-culture movement, or the 60's revolution, or whatever you want to call it.</sentence><sentence id="1194">Speak a little bit about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1197">A: Well, I was upset about it on -- actually on two counts.</sentence><sentence id="1198">But they are quite -- the -- the -- the issue really is a single issue.</sentence><sentence id="1199">The 60's counter-culture, in my eyes then, and</sentence><sentence id="1201">2 Interview with Regina Gelb March 23, 2001 in my eyes now, and this is 40 years later, were an inexcusable outburst that was allowed to permeate the cultural fabric in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">Revolution of young people is quite fine, but once it -- once it is accepted into the culture, without the analysis of what consequences that might bring, was terribly upsetting to me, and of course my chil -- the children were by then young, and I was very much afraid that they would be growing into an -- a society that was culturally in anarchy.</sentence><sentence id="1203">This government is a government of law, and we have a Constitution to preserve our legal rights.</sentence><sentence id="1204">But culture is something that is not legislated, and once you tear it apart, you might not be able to put the genie back in the bottle.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And of course, I had growing -- children that were young at that time, whatever, they were in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>, very impressionable age, and I really didn't like this whole idea of Woodstock, for example.</sentence><sentence id="1206">Of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodstock</span> becoming so prominent and so written up and photographed, and -- and televised, and repeated.</sentence><sentence id="1207">I mean, that was excess beyond excess.</sentence><sentence id="1208">This was a bunch of young kids who went completely wild.</sentence><sentence id="1209">That guy -- they got rid of their parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and everybody went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodstock</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1210">People could afford now to disregard the parents, because after all, I mean, you didn't have to work so hard for a living any more, this was a year of -- of -- of prosperity in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1211">This could not have happened in the 30's in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, during the depression.</sentence><sentence id="1212">That absolutely could not have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1213">So this to it -- it had to take its course.</sentence><sentence id="1214">And it took a long time because it couldn't be legislated away, and it could not be waved away as -- as if it</sentence><sentence id="1216">Interview with Regina Gelb * March 23, 2001 didn't exist, because it did exist.</sentence><sentence id="1217">But of course, all these kids who eventually decided to get done with what is called the American culture, and the American form of government ended up in communes, or they ended up in -- in the biggest corporations in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1245">A: Oh, it certainly did.</sentence><sentence id="1246">No, because you see, I -- I ha -- I am always of the opinion, have always been, as a child, as a grown-up, that there have to be -- there has to be a certain framework for society to operate within.</sentence><sentence id="1247">All the excesses that do nothing to enhance people's life, to me do not -- do not do anything to either elevate the spirit or to elevate the mind, or to improve somebody's economic conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1248">I mean, if you have a -- an idea, at least the idea should benefit somebody or something, or should build something, but to destroy it and leave it destroyed, is totally against my -- my understanding of life, because I have seen what happens when you are simply allowing something to happen, and everything in the process gets destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="1249">Of course, the Holocaust is a much bigger issue, mi -- a million times over bigger.</sentence><sentence id="1250">But the fact is that if you allow books to be burned, and the next step you allow people to be burned, i-i-1- i -- it almost -- it almost makes you think that if such excesses, that grow out of not any specific need, but the desire to rebel for rebellion's sake is totally wrong because it does nothing to improve anything.</sentence><sentence id="1251">And of course now it's -- it's quite obvious that this</sentence><sentence id="1253">Interview with Regina Gelb " March 23, 2001 was what the -- the -- this was one period in American life that as the years go on, will show to be not such a happy chapter.</sentence><sentence id="1254">It really was not a happy chapter.</sentence><sentence id="1255">I -- I felt terribly disturbed in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1256">I've calmed down about it now, because I've seen some of these -- these rebellious kids grow into very decent people, but I know that the aftermath of the 60's is still with us.</sentence><sentence id="1257">I mean, absolutely, all this permissiveness, and all that -- that followed from it still is around us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1272">Q: If you could try to say it as shortly as you ca -- as briefly -- sort of, in a capsule as you can, you did not become a social worker --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1273">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1274">Q: -- although that was on your -- well, and that had to do with a certain prevailing understanding at the time of what social work was supposed to be, and your being against it.</sentence><sentence id="1275">Could you kind of sum that up a little bit, please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A: Yes, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1279">Well, you know, originally I really wanted to do social work.</sentence><sentence id="1280">I really, truly did.</sentence><sentence id="1281">For many reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1282">One of the -- one of them being the fact that I did go through the Holocaust and had I not been helped as a child, I really wouldn't have survived.</sentence><sentence id="1283">And I really felt | owed this goodness to other people, and I ought to reciprocate.</sentence><sentence id="1284">However, by the time I came out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, with an idea of going to -- to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> for social work, the system changed, and I did not like the way the system was oriented, toward taking away the responsibility of the people to -- to -- to shift for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Rather than helping them be on their own feet, this was a system</sentence><sentence id="1287">Interview with Regina Gelb *8 March 23, 2001 now that was going to provide and provide and provide.</sentence><sentence id="1288">And it ended up that they brought up -- this system brought up two or three generations of dependents who lived off the state, that their lives are ruined because they have no responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="1289">They have absolutely no skill to be in the real world.</sentence><sentence id="1290">So, basically what I feared had to -- came true, and -- and -- and now I think the lesson has been learned and -- and things are quite different.</sentence><sentence id="1291">But in the -- at the time, at the very time when I was ready for social work, I realized that I -- that was not the <span class="DLF">field</span> for me any more.</sentence><sentence id="1292">| think I -- now I could go back.</sentence><sentence id="1293">I think I could.</sentence><sentence id="1294">Of course I am too old now to go looking for a job, nobody would want me.</sentence><sentence id="1295">But the thing is that at the present stage, I think I could fit better into the new framework than in the 50's and 60's -- especially in
