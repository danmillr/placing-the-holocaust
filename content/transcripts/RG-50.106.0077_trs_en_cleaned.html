class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and he really liked it but he at that time had no knowledge of how he would arrange making a living and coming here.</sentence><sentence id="3288">So he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3289">About nine months later, maybe a little more but let's say nine, nine and a half months later my father did pick up with my mother and my sister and moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3290">My mother had some cousins there.</sentence><sentence id="3291">And he felt maybe that would be better.</sentence><sentence id="3292">He didn't' like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>, didn't like what was going on there between the brothers, et

came and he got me.</sentence><sentence id="3295">And from a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on <span class="DLF">Davenport Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Northwest

money.</sentence><sentence id="3303">He my mother made hair ribbons and my sister and I helped and various other things like that.</sentence><sentence id="3304">And in the meantime all the while looking for some type of work.</sentence><sentence id="3305">Without getting too wordy on this.</sentence><sentence id="3306">About not too many months, not too many months, he found a position

encompassed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>, and <span

id="3312">It was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3313">It was cleaner at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3314">Than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New

class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3316">So I would say within a year's time we made a move here.</sentence><sentence id="3317">And I .</sentence><sentence id="3323">46 might add, I did start <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3324">In those days they put you in <span
