<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="55">But I'm curious about a couple of things.</sentence><sentence id="56">One, was there, did you have any hint when you were taken in, why you were taken in?</sentence><sentence id="57">You were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> at the time that you were arrested in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forth</span>, is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="145">Was there a sense that they were watching you?</sentence><sentence id="146">It seems that if they arrested you when you went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you were coming?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not have been a <span class="BUILDING">police prison</span> but it would have meant to be sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> at that time was not an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> but it was a camp of terror.</sentence><sentence id="149">And personally violent persecution.</sentence><sentence id="150">At that time the, a few friends of mine were shot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">And the proverb, if you can call it that, was created: shot while attempting to escape.</sentence><sentence id="152">Now, so | lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> having been relieved from the duty to report to <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span>, and | had the goal, as soon as possible, as early as possible, to be able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">And particularly so because on a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, not to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, | had arranged, my mother had arranged to meet me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in order to spend a pleasant weekend together.</sentence><sentence id="154">When she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been here today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you.</sentence><sentence id="155">We give you the opportunity to defend yourself.</sentence><sentence id="156">My mother had been extremely courageous and Fritz Schnaittacher 8 [Date not labeled] Page 8 she screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now because the following day she was going to leave the <span class="REGION">area</span> to live with her mother.</sentence><sentence id="157">And that's what she did.</sentence><sentence id="158">And that, the , the precarious actions of my mother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here.| had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="159">We had an interesting, rewarding time here.</sentence><sentence id="160">Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only earned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive.</sentence><sentence id="161">And to enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time.</sentence><sentence id="162">It is interesting to note that this now is the late fall of 1933.</sentence><sentence id="163">My brother had lived here already.</sentence><sentence id="164">He came, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived here, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married and therefore didn't have any other children.</sentence><sentence id="165">And my brother entered his <span class="BUILDING">business</span> and later on | joined him.</sentence><sentence id="166">We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00, $17.00 a week.</sentence><sentence id="167">On <span class="DLF">96" Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Western Avenue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the, what's the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>?</sentence><sentence id="169">The <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Paris</span>, which had a <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> and we could go swimming every night, for 25 cents.</sentence><sentence id="170">And it was really a wonderful way of living.</sentence><sentence id="171">Burdened only by our concern for our in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="262">2 What did they tell you about what was going on and what their experiences were?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying experiences that | had.</sentence><sentence id="264">As | had mentioned early, | had worked for my Uncle who <span class="BUILDING">Fritz Schnaittacher 11</span> [Date not labeled] Page 11 had a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">And when he came over here, he told me the following story.</sentence><sentence id="266">When he approached as it was customary his place of business on the morning of the Crystalnaught (ph), the manager of the business, not Jewish, to whom | had been reported when | worked for him, was standing at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to this business in the uniform of a storm trooper, and said, "Jews are not allowed here."</sentence><sentence id="267">And my Uncle did not protest because he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his <span class="DLF">door</span> and arrested him and took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some hundreds of miles away from where he lived.</sentence><sentence id="269">So my two Uncles were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and that was in November 1938.</sentence><sentence id="270">And finally they were able to get out in January of, | believe January of 1939.</sentence><sentence id="271">The Uncle with whom | had lived, the one who had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, because of the totally inadequate clothing that they received in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, suffered severe circulatory problems and that's what he died from some years later.</sentence><sentence id="272">But this is the story that he told me.</sentence><sentence id="273">So now, we go back, or we advance to the year 1945.</sentence><sentence id="274">Fritz, as a member of the 157"" Regiment of the 45" Division, contributed to the conquest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">And as soon as | had the time to follow up on this story which | told you, | went into my Uncle's place of business which had been bombed out, but people were there.</sentence><sentence id="276">And | inquired for the name of Hermann.</sentence><sentence id="277">Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my Uncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and having him arrested and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">And so this is

id="280">And | had the deep, deep satisfaction of locating him, having been an officer | had the privilege of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span>, and | drove out there.</sentence><sentence id="281">And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived.</sentence><sentence id="282">And there he was.</sentence><sentence id="283">| recognized him at once.</sentence><sentence id="284">And he just wore pants and long johns.</sentence><sentence id="285">And | told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed.</sentence><sentence id="286">He didn't recognize me.</sentence><sentence id="287">His wife and daughter protested vehemently.</sentence><sentence id="288">And | took him to the <span class="BUILDING">CIC Headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> where | interrogated him.</sentence><sentence id="289">And fortunately for me, because here | was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but | found out that he had been the guard in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">Which made him subject to automatic arrest.</sentence><sentence id="291">Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category and you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain crimes, such as having been the guard at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>. _</sentence><sentence id="292">| didn't tell him who | was until | finished the interrogation and | said, "Do you know who | am?"</sentence><sentence id="293">And he said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="294">| said, "My name is Schnaittacher.".</sentence><sentence id="295">So he said, "But you should know how much | did for your Uncle."</sentence><sentence id="296">So | said, "Yes, indeed, | do know."</sentence><sentence id="297">And with that | turned him over to the CIC, who were less humane than | was and at least he was put away in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for some months.</sentence><sentence id="298">The uniqueness of my war experience, | don't know whether, should we talk about
