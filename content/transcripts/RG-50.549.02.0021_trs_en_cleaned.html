<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: -- consisted of diving off the side of this --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Of jumping into the -- into the cold <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and being lucky enough to be fished out by -- by some little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that was around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and getting into the -- o-on <span class="REGION">land</span>, when the British came in, that was a -- a -- <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- some kind of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when we -- we came on -- on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tanks</span> were coming in and -- and tearing down the -- the flags.</sentence><sentence id="192">And then we -- we had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="193">Basically zero.</sentence><sentence id="194">What we had on was wet and that -- that was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived.</sentence><sentence id="195">So the British went into different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and told the Germans, give these people eat -- to eat, give these people something to wear and shoes and -- and this is how I started my new life.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: When -- do you remember, when you were with the British and they were telling Germans to give you something to eat and to give you clothes, I guess, how were the Germans reacting to that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Well, they -- they had no idea what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="199">They only saw the -- the British come in and they didn't know what were these wet -- wet people came from.</sentence><sentence id="200">They -- they saw some bombing maybe, but they didn't know that those -- those -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners, until they saw them with -- with the hair shor-shorn and no -- well, nobody had anything, but basically, no-nobody has a -- had a piece of paper to -- to prove who they</sentence><sentence id="202"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0021 8 were.</sentence><sentence id="203">Anyway, the British then -- then gave us some -- some identification cards.</sentence><sentence id="204">But it was hairy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: Hairy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: Very hairy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: In what <span class="NPIP">way</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: In very many ways.</sentence><sentence id="221">You -- you didn't know who you were talking to, whether it was a -- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who is now trying to -- to save his own hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, by accident.</sentence><sentence id="222">Anyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can't remember.</sentence><sentence id="223">Then it was difficult to get - - get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the Poles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were notified.</sentence><sentence id="224">But anybody behind the <span class="DLF">Iron Curtain</span>, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and -- nobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the UNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized myself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist for the officer's club.</sentence><sentence id="225">I didn't know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I -- I survived somehow and I played a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="226">Of course, it was difficult because -- I spoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same.</sentence><sentence id="227">But I had to make myself understood.</sentence><sentence id="228">And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get notification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ankara</span> who survived the war in - - in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">And I knew his address.</sentence><sentence id="230">I didn't have a chance to send anything to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>,</sentence><sentence id="232">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0021 9 because I -- I didn't know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly there was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="233">But through the Red Cross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive.</sentence><sentence id="234">So it took four months until I -- I finally got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235"><span class="COUNTRY">Mayas</span> -- with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="237">But I -- I joined at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech transport</span> and I got back somehow.</sentence><sentence id="238">On <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, on -- had no money, of course.</sentence><sentence id="239">And then I went to -- to my old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, not knowing whether my mother is around, or my father.</sentence><sentence id="240">That's where they -- they deported me from, originally.</sentence><sentence id="241">And so they were alive.</sentence><sentence id="242">And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra.</sentence><sentence id="243">They knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a -- with -- with that position.</sentence><sentence id="244">And those were the first few months, everything was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="245">There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="246">Basically, it was terrible times.</sentence><sentence id="247">And it was basically Russian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="248">So, we went through all kinds of horror stories.</sentence><sentence id="249">But I played.</sentence><sentence id="250">I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of things and then I left.</sentence><sentence id="251">Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is over, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et- etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="252">And we went over to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and we ha -- we s -- we had a -- with some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived.</sentence><sentence id="253">Because the world wasn't open.</sentence><sentence id="254">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, you couldn't -- couldn't get a job if you didn't have nationality -- I mean, didn't belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn't have the right kind of papers, you couldn't get a job.</sentence><sentence id="255">So when I went back, I played an</sentence><sentence id="257"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0021 10 audition for the opera.</sentence><sentence id="258">They were looking for a concertmaster in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and I got the job.</sentence><sentence id="259">I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the <span class="BUILDING">Budapest Philharmonic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">Twas like -- like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Philharmonic</span> and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the same.</sentence><sentence id="261">And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from way back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurterburg</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">So I got the passport, I didn't promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play the audition.</sentence><sentence id="264">And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a leave, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="265">And then I never went back, afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="266">I didn't go back, I went out to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and I was concertmaster in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurterburg</span> for three years.</sentence><sentence id="267">Then there was an opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and they wanted me to come.</sentence><sentence id="268">I played an audition again.</sentence><sentence id="269">I got the job and that's when I started in the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera, but that was one of the big operas.</sentence><sentence id="271">They had three in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span>, there were three or four <span class="BUILDING">opera houses</span>, but three of -- three of them were famous.</sentence><sentence id="272">The <span class="BUILDING">Startsh oper</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Commisher oper</span> was -- were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">My opera, the <span class="BUILDING">Shtetisher oper</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">And I never went over to the <span class="REGION">east side</span>, because I wasn't interested in it.</sentence><sentence id="275">I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian occupation is, I wasn't interested.</sentence><sentence id="276">But that was an interesting life.</sentence><sentence id="277"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Berlin</span> was -- was an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">And that was very good, until I got my American pa -- visa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa.</sentence><sentence id="279">And when I got</sentence><sentence id="281"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0021 11 it, I couldn't say, "No, I don't come, because I have a
