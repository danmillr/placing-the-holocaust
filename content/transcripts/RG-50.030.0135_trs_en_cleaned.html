<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="10">Uh...Gene, tell me something about your family and growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mill district</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>, my mother a Pittsburgher by the way.</sentence><sentence id="14">My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and was the compliant homemaker.</sentence><sentence id="15">Uh...We never had any money.</sentence><sentence id="16">My grandparents,...uh...all four, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> until my grandfather, my paternal went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">In 1925 or 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during World War II because the idea of the Germans taking over <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was an unpleasant idea to him and so he came back and he died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">We are a long lived family.</sentence><sentence id="19">My paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death.</sentence><sentence id="20">Uh...I grew up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mill district</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Squirrel Hill</span> because I had to go to Hebrew and all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew schools</span> were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Squirrel Hill</span>, and I completed my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> education at <span class="BUILDING">High School</span>, 40 percent Jewish and...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="21">And started the Pitt because I could live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pitt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">This was depression time.</sentence><sentence id="23">And then in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I was wasting my time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> and sent me off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">University of Cincinnati</span> at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="25">They were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the other...from each other.</sentence><sentence id="26">They still are.</sentence><sentence id="27">And...uh...got my degree from <span class="BUILDING">University of Cincinnati</span>, finished it <span class="BUILDING">HUC</span> in 1943, having accelerated a year because they needed chaplains so badly.</sentence><sentence id="28">And...uh...so we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for 22 straight months in order to accomplish this.</sentence><sentence id="29">No professor would allow us to give up a course.</sentence><sentence id="30">How can you be a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say.</sentence><sentence id="31">Uh...It was required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into chaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Worth</span>, <span class="REGION">Texas</span>, who went into the Navy and spent a very uncomfortable year there.</sentence><sentence id="32">I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the <span class="DLF">street</span> 23 years old was in uniform.</sentence><sentence id="33">Uh...The entire American army was in <span class="REGION">Texas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">And...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform.</sentence><sentence id="35">Uh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination.</sentence><sentence id="36">It was a long weekend, and...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="61">Q: When and under...when did you go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">What were the circumstances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Well, I had decided very early on that my war in World War II was the <span class="REGION">European theater</span>, not the <span class="REGION">Pacific theatre</span>, even though I wavered on that because of something I'll mention in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="69">But I had really decided that I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I had asked the Chief Chaplain's office to ship me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">Going <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> was unavoidable.</sentence><sentence id="71">I knew that.</sentence><sentence id="72">And so...uh...in February of 1945, I got orders to go <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> and didn't get there until April because that's the war the army worked.</sentence><sentence id="73">The...uh...thing I didn't mention to you was that while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Worth</span>, a member of my congregation who had rabbinical connections...uh..asked me, right after Yom Kippur services, as a matter of fact, if | had ever thought about becoming a pilot.</sentence><sentence id="74">Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the women pilots.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="83">I want to hold it.</sentence><sentence id="84">And can you stop the tape please?</sentence><sentence id="85">Alright, just hold the tape for a minute and then we'll pick it up.</sentence><sentence id="86">We've had construction problems on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="92">The sound is coming through the <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="94">These people are just marvelous.</sentence><sentence id="95">What we will do, we'll back it from the beginning of that story.</sentence><sentence id="96">I'll ask you to describe... Dean, tell me about...uh...the gentleman in <span class="REGION">Texas</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections.</sentence><sentence id="98">He came up to me after services on Yom Kippur and introduced himself.</sentence><sentence id="99">We had never met.</sentence><sentence id="100">I had been there all of about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all Rabbis were chicken.</sentence><sentence id="101">And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, "When do we start."</sentence><sentence id="102">And he said, "Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock."</sentence><sentence id="103">And (laughter) I said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="104">I can't do it tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="105">Give me a couple days."</sentence><sentence id="106">Because, among other things, I didn't have a flight jacket.</sentence><sentence id="107">And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket.</sentence><sentence id="108">You couldn't go up in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="109">They were open.</sentence><sentence id="110">There were no closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">That's a long time ago.</sentence><sentence id="112">So he taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I notified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing this in case it was of interest.</sentence><sentence id="113">And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they said.</sentence><sentence id="114">So I got my license and...uh...after <span class="BUILDING">Chaplain's school</span>, which was 5 weeks we got our assignments and I was signed to the armored force.</sentence><sentence id="115">And I thought, you know, "Typical Army screw up!"</sentence><sentence id="116">But...uh...It was done deliberately.</sentence><sentence id="117">I found out that they just didn't want Chaplains flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">They wanted Chaplains praying for troops.</sentence><sentence id="119">And so I did go to Europe instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking about.</sentence><sentence id="120">So | arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945.</sentence><sentence id="121">The...uh...voyage was of interest historically.</sentence><sentence id="122">I became the radio announcer on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>...I...on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">I probably was the only one who could read English, something of the sort.</sentence><sentence id="124">And several times a day I did news broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner.</sentence><sentence id="125">Uh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of Franklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">That was a very discouraging and depressing...uh...idea.</sentence><sentence id="127">Who...who was Truman became a very important question to those of us who were on our way <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">We also had a...uh... marathon bridge game going.</sentence><sentence id="129">It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army career ever suggested that we play <span class="DLF">bridge</span> for money.</sentence><sentence id="130">Never did.</sentence><sentence id="131">There were eight of us in this bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep.</sentence><sentence id="132">And...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days.</sentence><sentence id="133">Several million points were involved in my losses.</sentence><sentence id="134">Uh...I also agreed to...uh...box for the only time in my life,</sentence><sentence id="136">because they were having a series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy weight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had fought a couple of times before.</sentence><sentence id="137">We sort of sparred around for three rounds.</sentence><sentence id="138">I...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> from dockside to an <span class="BUILDING">Evac hospital</span> just outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lahov</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">And the rumor went around that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been hospitalized.</sentence><sentence id="140">And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again because I was so sick.</sentence><sentence id="141">I heard that long after I got into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">Couple...couple of people were surprised to see me.</sentence><sentence id="143">I was in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for 3 days.</sentence><sentence id="144">The hospital chaplain, who was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and he and I peddled each night into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where he had met a French couple, and we played bridge in French, which was fun.</sentence><sentence id="145">Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to work.</sentence><sentence id="146">So I...uh...was put onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop train</span> headed for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">Typical 40 and 8 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> and I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was standing at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to start and some sergeant was walking up and down yelling, "Who can talk French?</sentence><sentence id="148">Who knows some French?"</sentence><sentence id="149">So, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... "Will some French do?"</sentence><sentence id="150">And he says, "Three words will do.</sentence><sentence id="151">And Colonel needs a French translator."</sentence><sentence id="152">So I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because he was in the transportation corps running these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop trains</span> which didn't require much military skill.</sentence><sentence id="153">And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">It was a heated <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pullman car</span> and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">Uh...My job was every time the...uh... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped to tear up to the other end to the engineer and ask him what was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="156">And he told me, "Signal." (</sentence><sentence id="157">laughing) Every time, it was "Red Signal.</sentence><sentence id="158">I can't go."</sentence><sentence id="159">And I went back and told the Colonel who was quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="160">I had lots of bad books to read.</sentence><sentence id="161">I had a fine, fine trip into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">Uh...wasn't wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="163">No one knew what to do with me.</sentence><sentence id="164">I was moved back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span>, and...uh...as a casual.</sentence><sentence id="165">I did not have an assignment.</sentence><sentence id="166">And then V.E. day came, and we celebrated V.E. day by going from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span> to watch the celebration and to celebrate.</sentence><sentence id="167">I was depressed.</sentence><sentence id="168">I didn't feel like celebrating.</sentence><sentence id="169">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="170">I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to celebrate as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="171">The world was over, but in the square in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verea</span>, I saw some men and women in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="172">Clearly!</sentence><sentence id="173">Uh...I knew what they were, and they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them.</sentence><sentence id="174">They recognized my insignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into.</sentence><sentence id="175">They were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust whom I met.</sentence><sentence id="176">Uh... They didn't want anything.</sentence><sentence id="177">I didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="178">Uh... But we talked, and...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories.</sentence><sentence id="179">They were followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years.</sentence><sentence id="180">I did get an assignment to <span class="BUILDING">22nd Corps Headquarters</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hildan</span>, not to far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>, and I moved in.</sentence><sentence id="182">Large <span class="REGION">territory</span>, all of the Rhineland, including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">A lot of troops.</sentence><sentence id="184">Theoretically, we were conducting services for all those troops.</sentence><sentence id="185">I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">Early discovered that a lot of German Jews and a lot of East European Jews had come into the <span class="REGION">area</span> not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span>, but living on their own where they could find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live, which many of them could</sentence><sentence id="188">not do.</sentence><sentence id="189">So I began to do three things.</sentence><sentence id="190">First of all to push military government to find <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income and they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA installation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">And...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> uniforms, and that was not a very good idea.</sentence><sentence id="192">Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted of a gang coming together.</sentence><sentence id="193">There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to them,...uh... "Anybody need to say <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span>, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who needed to say <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span>, so we had a short <span class="BUILDING">service cottage</span>, and then I said, "Let's go.</sentence><sentence id="194">We need food.</sentence><sentence id="195">Let's go get it."</sentence><sentence id="196">And after the first time in each of these <span class="BUILDING">installations</span>, anybody who could beg, borrow or steal a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>...uh...came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and we went to <span class="BUILDING">army depots</span> and we got food.</sentence><sentence id="197">Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it.</sentence><sentence id="198">I have often had a nightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will some day.</sentence><sentence id="199">My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...1 know that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in World War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had signed a memorandum receipt for in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and had never turned in. ...</sentence><sentence id="200">Uh...Actually, he had turned it in, but the Army didn't think so.</sentence><sentence id="201">So he had a correspondence with the army for many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so someday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it.</sentence><sentence id="202">We just stole it.</sentence><sentence id="203">And there were millions of tons of supplies stashed in <span class="BUILDING">depots</span> around the <span class="REGION">area</span> and...uh...they should be used.</sentence><sentence id="204">And they were.</sentence><sentence id="205">We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing.</sentence><sentence id="206">Couldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear.</sentence><sentence id="207">There were socks.</sentence><sentence id="208">There were shoes.</sentence><sentence id="209">There were jackets and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="210">So, we were starting a pretty good system going when orders came out moving us.</sentence><sentence id="211">Uh... The British were taking over our <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">There had been negotiations and most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> became <span class="REGION">British zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">And in typical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plezn</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">We packed up and we started across <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">Before that happened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I decided that I better do something in this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that needed doing for me.</sentence><sentence id="216">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">Took a 3 day pass and took my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> where Abe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto himself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing.</sentence><sentence id="218">Uh...My reaction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> to be.</sentence><sentence id="219">There was still 30 odd thousand Jews there.</sentence><sentence id="220">Some were dying each day cause there was no way for them to make it.</sentence><sentence id="221">Most of them were going to live.</sentence><sentence id="222">They didn't look like they were going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said they were going to live.</sentence><sentence id="223">Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he had this fine clothing for them.</sentence><sentence id="224">I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes out of a <span class="BUILDING">German Army warehouse</span> just by going in, opening the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, and taking them.</sentence><sentence id="225">And...uh...Every day he had people to bury.</sentence><sentence id="226">I...uh...often have said to people who are skeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off approximately how many...uh...feet of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> it takes in full directions to make a rectangle that would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them.</sentence><sentence id="227">Uh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back.</sentence><sentence id="228">On the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the Germans didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> cause when we went into the marvelous</sentence><sentence id="231">old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yana</span>, and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of Weimar, I saw smoke.</sentence><sentence id="232">And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not the...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald concentration camp</span> where there were still people.</sentence><sentence id="233">You could see them.</sentence><sentence id="234">They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of those two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right way during those years...uh...you could smell <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> without any trouble.</sentence><sentence id="236">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>, and I settled into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and to my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">Uh... Two things happened in fairly short order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest.</sentence><sentence id="238">The other of which transformed my life.</sentence><sentence id="239">I'll do the easy one first.</sentence><sentence id="240">I got a phone call.</sentence><sentence id="241">It was the Bishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>, a Catholic Bishop who told me his name, which I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="242">And I said to him, "Sir, I.. (You see he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun," and he said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="243">You're the Rabbi, aren't you?"</sentence><sentence id="244">And I said, "Yes Sir."</sentence><sentence id="245">And he said, "You're the man I want to come to see, he said, "You don't have to come out here."</sentence><sentence id="246">It was a couple of miles from us to the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> was. "</sentence><sentence id="247">I am coming down this evening.</sentence><sentence id="248">I'll stop in."</sentence><sentence id="249">And I went to see him.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I met for the first time a bishop who looked like a bishop.</sentence><sentence id="251">You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the whole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="252">Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...it will be a great relief to one of his parishioners if I would go with him.</sentence><sentence id="253">I said, "Alright," and we made a date for the next afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="254">We went into the old part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>, which is centuries old.</sentence><sentence id="255">These wonderful 4 and 5 story <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span>, which looked like a slum on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and are often very nice on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an engineer, who told me the following story.</sentence><sentence id="256">In the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which he lived, a neighbor had been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, by the way, was still standing.</sentence><sentence id="258">We cleaned it out.</sentence><sentence id="259">It had been made a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, of course, by the Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> during that time.</sentence><sentence id="260">It may still be used.</sentence><sentence id="261">I have no idea. (</sentence><sentence id="262">Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder, became very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist paintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect.</sentence><sentence id="263">In 1938, when the Nazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, "They are going to take our pictures because they want paintings.</sentence><sentence id="264">They steal paintings.</sentence><sentence id="265">Let's hide them.</sentence><sentence id="266">Snyder, being an engineer, was ingenious, and he took his <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> which was 40 feet long, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="267">One of these <span class="BUILDING">European saloon</span>-type rooms, and he built a fake <span class="DLF">wall</span> 3 feet in from the regular <span class="DLF">wall</span>, and that <span class="DLF">wall</span> was covered with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">book shelves</span> and other nice things, with one a typical <span class="DLF">spring door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">He took me <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and there were all the paintings which they had stashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his.</sentence><sentence id="269">His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that, obviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings.</sentence><sentence id="270">If he did not come back, all the paintings would be Snyder's.</sentence><sentence id="271">Uh...He also left some books, and that's why the Bishop had taken me.</sentence><sentence id="272">His most precious books.</sentence><sentence id="273">Rabbi Katz was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the books.</sentence><sentence id="274">And I took the books at Snyder's request.</sentence><sentence id="275">An interesting group of 4, 5 books.</sentence><sentence id="276">Not his <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, just the books he cared most about.</sentence><sentence id="277">One 2 volume set turns out to be precious.</sentence><sentence id="278">It's now in the rare <span class="INT_SPACE">book room</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">It's one of two copies of this 1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...in the whole world.</sentence><sentence id="280">The other one is at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">Uh... There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to Sylvia.</sentence><sentence id="282">We'll come across Sylvia shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th</sentence><sentence id="284">Century, which I gave to the Bishop.</sentence><sentence id="285">And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent home an album of Visidor Kaufman, a prince.</sentence><sentence id="286">Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter of the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East European types.</sentence><sentence id="287">And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are classics.</sentence><sentence id="288">And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of them.</sentence><sentence id="289">That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books.</sentence><sentence id="290">The same day there was a knock on my <span class="DLF">door</span> and a little woman walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform.</sentence><sentence id="291">Uh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years older than I, and she told me the following story.</sentence><sentence id="292">She was a social worker who had been part of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue, which was then just called <span class="BUILDING">Free Synagogue</span> because Steven Wise was still living.</sentence><sentence id="293">And she had worked for Wises, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise.</sentence><sentence id="294">When <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> got into the war, he said to her, "You have to go into the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>."</sentence><sentence id="295">And she said, "Why?</sentence><sentence id="296">To feed donuts to G.L."s?"</sentence><sentence id="297">And he said, "Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and you are going to be able to help Jews.</sentence><sentence id="298">There will be survivors, and they are going to need all kinds of help and you're just the type to do it."</sentence><sentence id="299">He was right.</sentence><sentence id="300">She was just the type.</sentence><sentence id="301">She got into the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids who survived, and that was the transport that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> legally...uh...after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="303">She landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">I don't know how.</sentence><sentence id="305">And was the director of the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross club</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown Plzen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">She had four other women working with her.</sentence><sentence id="307">And from early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and talked and chatted with American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="308">Then they closed up for the night, and they opened the <span class="DLF">back door</span> and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things.</sentence><sentence id="309">Uh...Sylvia asked me if I wanted to help Jews.</sentence><sentence id="310">Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed "Yal," and...uh...asked her what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="311">She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade group which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">They had been attached to the British army in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, had fought through the war, and at the end of the war were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trevisio</span>, way up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Italian Alps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> and they sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and they began to move Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span>, illegal of course, to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and would I help with this enterprise?</sentence><sentence id="314">We could send Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the Brigade would pick them up and take them to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year old kid.</sentence><sentence id="316">Cops and robbers!</sentence><sentence id="317">And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">Actually, it was out of all of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, because at that point the <span class="DLF">border</span> between the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> was an open <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">We were still friendly.</sentence><sentence id="320">We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="321">So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> I wanted to go for my purposes.</sentence><sentence id="322">And...uh...two things happened.</sentence><sentence id="323">First, Sylvia and I went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">There were 6,000 Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">Rothchild Hospital</span> there without a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and new people were coming in all the time.</sentence><sentence id="325">Some from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">First time I had heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">Others from <span class="REGION">further East</span> coming West because they had no intentions of living in the East.</sentence><sentence id="328">Uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not a place for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="329">Uh...They didn't want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">They didn't want to Czech.</sentence><sentence id="331">They didn't want to live in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="332">They wanted out.</sentence><sentence id="333">And they would come to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> hoping that somebody would have some ideas about how to get out.</sentence><sentence id="334">They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very</sentence><sentence id="336">important function.</sentence><sentence id="337">We'll talk about that some more when we come back to Abe Klausner.</sentence><sentence id="338">We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">Rothchild Hospital</span> to...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> is only about 40 or 50 miles.</sentence><sentence id="340">The only way to get there is by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="341">We then proceeded to type one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> for the purpose of looking for relatives.</sentence><sentence id="342">We looked around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> for the biggest stamp we could find.</sentence><sentence id="343">I haven't any idea what it was about, but we found one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this thing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document.</sentence><sentence id="344">And...uh...We would collect them when the people came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span> and then take them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> because I could travel.</sentence><sentence id="345">And...uh...leave them at our <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span>, <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and a new group would come.</sentence><sentence id="346">Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time.</sentence><sentence id="347">We didn't want large groups taking over <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, so they came in every day.</sentence><sentence id="348">And they reported to us at the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross Club</span> after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov displaced persons camp which was just on the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plzen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">It was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">We were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="351">I went out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, "Tell me.</sentence><sentence id="353">Does the C stand for Carnegie?,"</sentence><sentence id="354">and he said, "How do you know?"</sentence><sentence id="355">I said, "Because anybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that your middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>."</sentence><sentence id="356">And he said, "Amazing."</sentence><sentence id="357">I said, "Yal, So am I." And we talked and he said, "Lipman.</sentence><sentence id="358"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lipman</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">Is your old man a jeweler?"</sentence><sentence id="360">And I said, "Yal."</sentence><sentence id="361">And he said, "I bought my wedding ring from him."</sentence><sentence id="362">His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his wife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp..</span>We used for transportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the answer was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U.S. Army trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">And who drove them?</sentence><sentence id="364">U.S. Army personnel.</sentence><sentence id="365">Why did they do it?</sentence><sentence id="366">Scotch.</sentence><sentence id="367">And some money.</sentence><sentence id="368">We did not want people doing us favors.</sentence><sentence id="369">We were commercial.</sentence><sentence id="370">Uh...We made a trip down to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> and made the discovery that the only <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the Danu...<span class="RIVER">Australian Rivers</span> that we knew about was a <span class="DLF">military bridge</span> and we weren't about to use that.</sentence><sentence id="371">So we went down the <span class="DLF">road</span> looking for a way to get across that blasted <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and we found one.</sentence><sentence id="372">It was an old <span class="DLF">dam</span> no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide enough at the top for an Army 6-pods to get across with about 6 inches of play on each <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">And that's the one we used.</sentence><sentence id="374">We went across the <span class="DLF">dam</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and found our way either to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lintz</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gratz</span> or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltsport</span>, depending on whether the Brigade told us to bring this bunch of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="375">Others, it worked.</sentence><sentence id="376">But I have to tell you where we got the liquor because that involves one of my more favorite memories.</sentence><sentence id="377">I was entitled to a few bottles of Scotch a week as a...I was a Captain by then.</sentence><sentence id="378">That wasn't enough because we needed at least a dozen to 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip.</sentence><sentence id="379">Uh...One of the breaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this... Massel is not to be considered a minor thing.</sentence><sentence id="380">The...uh...sergeant in charge of our <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Corps Headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">Now <span class="BUILDING">Corps Headquarters</span> has a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">It just does.</sentence><sentence id="383">Uh...Corps a big thing.</sentence><sentence id="384">Was a sergeant named Katz, and he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>, and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he would get truck drivers for me and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we would pay with money and Scotch.</sentence><sentence id="385">As I recall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="386">But where the Hell do you get Scotch in that kind of quantity?</sentence><sentence id="387">And I decided to take a real risk.</sentence><sentence id="388">I went to my senior</sentence><sentence id="390">chaplain, a Presbyterian from <span class="REGION">Kansas</span>, Bird Colonel, full Colonel, but not regular army.</sentence><sentence id="391">He was a reservist.</sentence><sentence id="392">A very, quiet, pleasant man.</sentence><sentence id="393">He said to me, "You know, I haven't asked you any questions, but you travel a lot more than is comfortable for the Chief of Staff."</sentence><sentence id="394">Cause I was going to all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camps</span> and communities and people I could find all over <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="395">I was also going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> by then.</sentence><sentence id="396">We haven't come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="397">And he said...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me about this and I said I would investigate it."</sentence><sentence id="398">He said, "I can cover for you if I know where you are going.</sentence><sentence id="399">And you haven't any reason to tell me where you are going, but you will have to or I can't cover for you with the Chief of Staff," who is after all a 2-star General.</sentence><sentence id="400">I said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="401">I'll make a deal with you.</sentence><sentence id="402">When I leave each day, I will put under your blotter a statement of where I am going, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> each day, and then I'll give you my trip ticket.</sentence><sentence id="403">And you validate it if you chose to do so."</sentence><sentence id="404">He said, "Of course, I chose to do so.</sentence><sentence id="405">I know what you're doing and you got to do it."</sentence><sentence id="406">He did not know that we were taking Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, but he knew I was working with Jewish displaced persons and he thought that was absolutely essential.</sentence><sentence id="407">Bless him, said I. He says, "Anything else I can do for you?"</sentence><sentence id="408">And I said, "Yal.</sentence><sentence id="409">You're a Bird Colonel.</sentence><sentence id="410">You get all the liquor you want, don't you?"</sentence><sentence id="411">He said, "I wouldn't know.</sentence><sentence id="412">I don't drink."</sentence><sentence id="413">I said, "I knew that, but you're about to."</sentence><sentence id="414">And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are going to be awfully (laughing) surprised.</sentence><sentence id="415">I said, "You don't have to explain what you're doing with it.</sentence><sentence id="416">It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which is your bound duty as a Christian."</sentence><sentence id="417">And he smiled and he thought that made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab.</sentence><sentence id="418">Bless his heart.</sentence><sentence id="419">I was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry.</sentence><sentence id="420">He was a good, good man.</sentence><sentence id="421">He saved my life, and saved Jews.</sentence><sentence id="422">That operation worked very well until August when...uh...we got caught in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austria towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="423">Red handed!</sentence><sentence id="424">The whole bunch of us!</sentence><sentence id="425">We had not yet transferred these people to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span>...uh...and we got picked up.</sentence><sentence id="426">And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was going to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed.</sentence><sentence id="427">And...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me.</sentence><sentence id="428">General Hubner, who was known as the little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="429">He didn't want Jews in his <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="430">I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only displaced persons who were difficult.</sentence><sentence id="431">All other displaced persons, and there were 20 some nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the Germans imported for labor purposes.</sentence><sentence id="432">They were grateful for being alive, for being fed by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were no hurry to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="433">The Jews were not grateful.</sentence><sentence id="434">The Jews were in terrible conflict over being alive, over having survived.</sentence><sentence id="435">They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they wanted out, and nobody would let them out.</sentence><sentence id="436">And so they caused more trouble than everybody else put together.</sentence><sentence id="437">Some of us understood it.</sentence><sentence id="438">We tried to organize it so that it wasn't too difficult.</sentence><sentence id="439">In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that we always have.</sentence><sentence id="440">For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was was in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted everything.</sentence><sentence id="441">It was not easy.</sentence><sentence id="442">And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think that should be understandable that they were not.</sentence><sentence id="443">So General Hubnere said, "Get them out of here.</sentence><sentence id="444">I don't care."</sentence><sentence id="445">He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved.</sentence><sentence id="446">One incident will illustrate this.</sentence><sentence id="447">He called Sylvia and me in one day.</sentence><sentence id="448">Now I had never met General Hubner.</sentence><sentence id="451">Uh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals.</sentence><sentence id="452">There are layers of bureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with Generals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was always making demands.</sentence><sentence id="453">Sylvia was a tough, tough lady.</sentence><sentence id="454">And Sylvia told the General...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to monkey with the Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="455">He needed the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="456">Those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">donuts</span> were very precious.</sentence><sentence id="457">Donuts and coffee kept American troops going.</sentence><sentence id="458">Uh...He called us in and said, "I hear there is going to be a Jewish meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to talk about the future of all these Jews."</sentence><sentence id="459">And we said, "Yep."</sentence><sentence id="460">And he said, "You're going.</sentence><sentence id="461">You go my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">When does the meeting start?"</sentence><sentence id="463">And we told and he said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="464">Two days before that, get out there and tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here.</sentence><sentence id="465">They should do everything they can do to get them out fast.</sentence><sentence id="466">It's not good for them and it is not good for us either."</sentence><sentence id="467">And he said it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling.</sentence><sentence id="468">And Sylvia and I flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to the special Zionist Congress that was called in July in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, the chief purpose of which was to set the course that would lead to...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>'s independence 3 years later, which meant that Ben-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with Wietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable.</sentence><sentence id="469">Uh...What did he say?</sentence><sentence id="470">He did what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ben-Gurion</span> always did.</sentence><sentence id="471">Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first to tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way up.</sentence><sentence id="472">Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute.</sentence><sentence id="473">Four hours was not his longest speech.</sentence><sentence id="474">Uh...He has made longer.</sentence><sentence id="475">And then rehearsing the Zionist movement from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belu</span> all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II, subjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he was the savior who was going to see to it that we had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish State</span>.</sentence><sentence id="476">And they believed him.</sentence><sentence id="477">And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer.</sentence><sentence id="478">Wietzman aged 10 years in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of the State.</sentence><sentence id="479">Powerless and

id="3097">Uh...But the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, we had to go through <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="DLF">border points</span> because we were in 6 by 6 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span>, though we never used wood burning ones.</sentence><sentence id="3098">We bought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3099">We bought gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="3100">If did not have Army supplies unless we could steal them, and you couldn't steal large quantities of gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="3101">That's hard to do.</sentence><sentence id="3102">But by this time we had a budget and we were getting money from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3103">This was a transport of about twelve hundred people, leaving Saturday night from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noowhom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3104">We owned a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Noowhom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3105">We bought it.</sentence><sentence id="3106">It was ours.</sentence><sentence id="3107">And we could use it to get people ready to go.</sentence><sentence id="3108">And we would appear there on either Friday or sometime early Saturday, and the people would arrive.</sentence><sentence id="3109">How they were selected and how they got there is a story unto itself, but that's what we eventually had 130 Palestinians doing out around the <span class="REGION">countryside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3110">They had political problems; they had age problems; they had all kinds of problems in making up these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3111">How did we know how many to send?</sentence><sentence id="3112">Uh...Let me ask myself the question when I finish the Myrlon Lynn story because it's a separate story which has its own kind of interest.</sentence><sentence id="3113">We got instructions on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3114">Saturday night we would have our people all ready.</sentence><sentence id="3115">This was a well organized thing.</sentence><sentence id="3116">We knew who was going to be in which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3117">If they were pregnant women, they were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and there was a nurse with them.</sentence><sentence id="3118">Sometimes the nurse was a woman named Esther Lipman, who was not a nurse.</sentence><sentence id="3119">But she was pregnant at the time, so she knew all about it. (</sentence><sentence id="3120">Laughing) We were going to have our second child, so Esther a few pieces of equipment and she went on some of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> as transport nurse.</sentence><sentence id="3121">We never delivered a baby on one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>, I'm glad to say.</sentence><sentence id="3122">It's just as well.</sentence><sentence id="3123">The tough part of the trip was the night part into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3124">And so we left.</sentence><sentence id="3125">Every 2 hours we would stop for relief.</sentence><sentence id="3126">We left at midnight so that we had two or three 2-hour periods before dawn.</sentence><sentence id="3127">At dawn or shortly thereafter, we would arrive at what was known as the <span class="DLF">picnic area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3128">We had been looking for this for weeks, and when we found it, it was as though we had found <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3129">There was a place in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> where a small <span class="DLF">road</span> went off to the right.</sentence><sentence id="3130">And they went about a half a mile and then there was a circle, at the end of which there was a <span class="BUILDING">wine house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3131">End of <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3132">That's perfect.</sentence><sentence id="3133">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3134">On the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3135">And there we got one of the great breaks of the entire era.</sentence><sentence id="3136">When a DP named Gittshuck, who worked for us, and I were looking for this <span class="NPIP">place</span>...and...for a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and we came to this, we decided we better check out that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3137">We knocked on the <span class="DLF">cabin door</span>, and a lady answered wearing Bavarian costumes as everybody in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> did.</sentence><sentence id="3138">They wore old fashioned Bavarian costumes.</sentence><sentence id="3139">And we talked to her and asked her if she would have any objections if every once in awhile, every week, 10 days, some people would come and rest on the side of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and use the stream at the bottom of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> just to wash.</sentence><sentence id="3140">And she said, "I have no objection, but who are they?"</sentence><sentence id="3141">And I said, "They're <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors who are going to their new <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and we are moving</sentence><sentence id="3143">1 them."</sentence><sentence id="3144">And she said, "Oh, can I help?"</sentence><sentence id="3145">And I said, "If you want to feed them, it would be a great help.</sentence><sentence id="3146">We often have children.</sentence><sentence id="3147">It would be marvelous if we could leave cereal with you and we could have hot gruel for these kids when they get here and hot tea for the adults.</sentence><sentence id="3148">That would be absolutely marvelous."</sentence><sentence id="3149">Nothing to that.</sentence><sentence id="3150">Asked some more questions, as I was interested.</sentence><sentence id="3151">This woman was a Jew, who had married when she was at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> a non*Jewish German.</sentence><sentence id="3152">When the Nazi...when the war started, he was pulled into the Army.</sentence><sentence id="3153">She decided and he decided and his father decided that she should hide out in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span> with the father because he lived there in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3154">How many people would come into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> looking for somebody?</sentence><sentence id="3155">Uh...She was announced as his daughter-in-law, and her husband was off in the Army being a hero.</sentence><sentence id="3156">Her husband was killed on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>, so she stayed.</sentence><sentence id="3157">Took care of the old man.</sentence><sentence id="3158">She took care of the old man till he died about 1946, and because some of the neighbors knew that she was Jewish and nobody had turned her in, she decided to live out her life there.</sentence><sentence id="3159">She had a job.</sentence><sentence id="3160">She worked.</sentence><sentence id="3161">She had her husband's pension from the Army, whatever it was, and she was living there.</sentence><sentence id="3162">So then we were able to tell her that these were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3163">And this became our <span class="DLF">picnic area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3164">Every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milhouse</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>...uh ...went through there, and this woman loved it.</sentence><sentence id="3165">She was magnificent.</sentence><sentence id="3166">I remember her with great affection.</sentence><sentence id="3167">Any how, after resting at the <span class="DLF">picnic ground</span> and having a meal, we got back into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">the trucks</span> and headed for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pompdecess</span>, where the only <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="3168">It was a <span class="DLF">military bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3169">And...uh..we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pompdecess</span>, and we had to be there at 4 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="3170">Not 5, not 3 because the French officer whom we owned, the , immigration officer, was sure to be on duty then.</sentence><sentence id="3171">Any day but Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="3172">And he would take our papers and pass them right through.</sentence><sentence id="3173">So we got through the Duon easily.</sentence><sentence id="3174">And then from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milhouse</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was nothing to it, and there there was a big <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> and the French Haganah picked up the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhous</span> and took them by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to somewhere in the <span class="REGION">Marseilles area</span> depending on where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was going to be sit, Port Boog or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> itself, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3175">This particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> had Tereska on board as a DP.</sentence><sentence id="3176">She had DP papers.</sentence><sentence id="3177">She had DP clothing.</sentence><sentence id="3178">She was a DP.</sentence><sentence id="3179">In front of this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> just before my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was the <span

had to make noise.</sentence><sentence id="3183">He had to call something out to the camera crew.</sentence><sentence id="3184">You can't do it.</sentence><sentence id="3185">He had to call this... There's simply no way to do it.</sentence><sentence id="3186">You're going to shut up or you ain't going.</sentence><sentence id="3187">You see you had to go through the American zone of occupation to the French zone of occupation.</sentence><sentence id="3188"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pompdecess</span> was in the <span class="REGION">French zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3189">The <span class="REGION">French zone</span> was a small <span class="REGION">zone</span> in the <span class="REGION">southwestern Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3190">The French insisted on having a <span class="REGION">zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3191">It was a four-power power thing after all.</sentence><sentence id="3192">So going from the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> to the <span class="REGION">French zone</span> was the dangerous one.</sentence><sentence id="3193">And having the camera crew along was great, because we say the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> wanted to have records of all these transports of survivors as they go to their new <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and...uh..we have a crew with us, and want to take your picture at the <span class="DLF">border</span> as you do your duty, and we got through very fast.</sentence><sentence id="3194">Uh...It was very difficult for Myer.</sentence><sentence id="3195">I am sure he suffered a lot.</sentence><sentence id="3196">It's got the illegals.</sentence><sentence id="3197">It is still available in 16 millimeter.</sentence><sentence id="3198">It still gets rented I understand by <span class="BUILDING">school</span> groups and others who want to see it.</sentence><sentence id="3199">One minor tragedy in it which we laugh about in our family, but it isn't totally funny.</sentence><sentence id="3200">Esther was along on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> as transport nurse.</sentence><sentence id="3201">The only time that I appear in the film was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pompdecess</span> where I am standing with the Duan going over the papers and getting people ready to go through.</sentence><sentence id="3202">And Esther was filmed there too.</sentence><sentence id="3203">There were other pictures of me in the...in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3204">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with a</sentence><sentence id="3206">2 <span class="DLF">moveable roof</span> so that we could stand on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and watch what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3207">Dangerous, but...uh...very effective because we had to see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3208">We didn't want to lose any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3209">They had to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3210">Uh...We had to go through one or two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fribrook</span> for example and in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fribrook</span>, we did not want to lose <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3211">But the only one that got printed and is in the film is me at the...there's nothing of Esy.</sentence><sentence id="3212">All the shots of Esther got cut in the editing, and she never stopped teasing Myer about it.</sentence><sentence id="3213">And whenever we met, he would come up and want to hug her hello and she would say, "You don't want to hug me.</sentence><sentence id="3214">You wouldn't even put me in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movie</span>."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3494">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="3495">Alright.</sentence><sentence id="3496">Uh...How did you start preparing for the Exodus?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3500">A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> on a certain date.</sentence><sentence id="3501">The largest <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that had ever been contemplated.</sentence><sentence id="3502">And the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> did their job.</sentence><sentence id="3503">And it was decided that two of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> would go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, by way of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.580032" long="7.749989">Strasbourg</span>, and three of them would go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they would be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up, and do this three times.</sentence><sentence id="3504">Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid- week which we had never done before.</sentence><sentence id="3505">But what're we going to do.</sentence><sentence id="3506">Because we had to get these people on board.</sentence><sentence id="3507">The British were watching this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in sit where it was, and they didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it.</sentence><sentence id="3508">All of these people had to get new identities because we using a series of French transit visas that the Minister of the Interior people had kindly prepared for us, but they were...we would call in blank.</sentence><sentence id="3509">They weren't really blank at all.</sentence><sentence id="3510">They had names on them.</sentence><sentence id="3511">They just weren't names of any living people, and they all had ages and they all had <span class="BUILDING">birth places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3512">So we prepared in advance DP cards.</sentence><sentence id="3513">Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> with military authorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we issued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we handed them out at Nooam in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> there, and told them, "You got a new name.</sentence><sentence id="3514">You got to know how old you are.</sentence><sentence id="3515">You got to know where you were born.</sentence><sentence id="3516">It has nothing to do with you.</sentence><sentence id="3517">It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of piece."</sentence><sentence id="3518">So they all had to learn them.</sentence><sentence id="3519">And some of the old people had difficulties with this.</sentence><sentence id="3520">Kids had no trouble at all.</sentence><sentence id="3521">There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox origins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he memorized his name and his birthplace and his birth date.</sentence><sentence id="3522">It was nice.</sentence><sentence id="3523">And then we took them.</sentence><sentence id="3524">Normally, when we got <span class="BUILDING">Milhouse</span> there was a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="3525">A wonderful lady owned it who fed us a hot meal.</sentence><sentence id="3526">This is the staff who had gone on the trip.</sentence><sentence id="3527">The people were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> bound for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> already...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part of the next day.</sentence><sentence id="3528">Relax a little bit, have some fun, drink some good wine.</sentence><sentence id="3529">I learned to eat pate for the first time and...<span class="BUILDING">Milhouse</span> is in...uh...SS Lorraine...that part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they made wonderful pate.</sentence><sentence id="3530">So this time we got there early evening.</sentence><sentence id="3531">We turned in.</sentence><sentence id="3532">Didn't have all that wonderful hospitality.</sentence><sentence id="3533">And in the middle of the night, we got back in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days.</sentence><sentence id="3534">Esy was not with me on the Exodus ones.</sentence><sentence id="3535">I don't remember why not, but she wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="3536">And...uh...when I left I said to her as I always did, "I'll be back when I get here," and all she would say to people who called was, "I am sorry.</sentence><sentence id="3537">He's out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3538">Have you tried the <span class="BUILDING">Munich office</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="3539">Uh...This was the longest I had been away.</sentence><sentence id="3540">And she allowed as how she was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing we could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="3541">That's how the people got on the exodus.</sentence><sentence id="3542">The French Haganah did a superlative job in getting all those <span

class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4069">Michael was very disturbed because nothing he was ever going to see again.</sentence><sentence id="4070">He was 3, and....uh...he couldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothered him more than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="4071">He...uh...he really a mess.</sentence><sentence id="4072">But we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, settled in for a couple of days and went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .Two of the people in the world closest to us were Eva Kaufman, now Eva Kaufman Penn, and her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufman.</sentence><sentence id="4073">They had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> in 1946 for Jay to get a doctorate at <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4074">Uh...They tried to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the middle of the Maritime strike, and they got held up, and stayed at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4075">When they left they were allowed to go, but they couldn't take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4076">They had <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and stayed with us until Paul was done.</sentence><sentence id="4077">It was this kind of relationship.</sentence><sentence id="4078">Then they disappeared in the wilds of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4079">What we heard about them once in awhile was from Jay's parents who would drop us a note saying they got a letter.</sentence><sentence id="4080">They were okay, and then we didn't get that any more for awhile because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> was under siege, and they were in the of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4081">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and we went to to the and Michael was riding a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kiddie car</span> up and down the <span class="DLF">platform</span>, and we suddenly heard a scream.</sentence><sentence id="4082">It was Eva.</sentence><sentence id="4083">She and Jay had tickets for the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4084">Coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="4085">And she was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, and we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic which was an extraordinary experience, just trying to catch up with one another with these two very pregnant ladies.</sentence><sentence id="4086">Their son, their first child, was born on <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>'s independence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later.</sentence><sentence id="4087">I had had an offer from Henry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the world's greatest fund raiser in all of history.</sentence><sentence id="4088">I would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars.</sentence><sentence id="4089">As of that date, that was the largest fund raising campaign in private hands in the history of the world.</sentence><sentence id="4090">And it was not surpassed for quite awhile.</sentence><sentence id="4091">Now, of course, it sounds like small</sentence><sentence id="4093">9 money thanks to inflation, but it was an absolutely amazing out-pouring of money.</sentence><sentence id="4094">Uh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time.</sentence><sentence id="4095">One of my first speeches was on the night of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>'s independence.</sentence><sentence id="4096">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span>, <span class="REGION">Virginia</span>, to speak.</sentence><sentence id="4097">Why was I sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4098">Because the featured speaker was the Senator from <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>, Alban Berkley, shortly to become Vice President of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4099">Now Barkley was one of the world's worst speakers in terms of content, but he was an affable pleasant guy and he loved Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4100">And he went around making speeches for Jews and for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and for Zionism all the time.</sentence><sentence id="4101">So he was to be the featured speaker.</sentence><sentence id="4102">He made a very short speech.</sentence><sentence id="4103">He walked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I made a sort of content speech.</sentence><sentence id="4104">Only later I discovered how much money he was paid for all the speeches he made for the Zionist movement and for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and for the UJA and the rest.</sentence><sentence id="4105">Fortunately, I make it a practice not to have illusions about public figures, so I didn't get disillusioned about him.</sentence><sentence id="4106">Uh...He was not a pleasant experience.</sentence><sentence id="4107">Most of them were very pleasant experiences because to watch people give more money than they ought to give...uh...has its beauties.</sentence><sentence id="4108">And the statements they made.</sentence><sentence id="4109">Uh...I didn't fight in the second World War.</sentence><sentence id="4110">I was too old.</sentence><sentence id="4111">I was not involved in the decimation of our people in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="4112">Therefore, the least I can do is pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="4113">And the money poured in.</sentence><sentence id="4114">Unbelievable amounts of money.</sentence><sentence id="4115">I learned to respect sacrificial giving for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="4116">There has been very little of it, of course, but I respect it when I find it.</sentence><sentence id="4117">I was invited to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hawaii</span> to open their campaign.</sentence><sentence id="4118">That was exciting.</sentence><sentence id="4119">Never been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hawaii</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4120">And I understood that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hawaii Jewish community</span> was all excited.</sentence><sentence id="4121">When you're that far away, you get more excitement.</sentence><sentence id="4122">Excitement grows in direct proportion to the distance from the action.</sentence><sentence id="4123">And...uh...Montra called, asked me to go.</sentence><sentence id="4124">I said, "What dates?"</sentence><sentence id="4125">And he said, "Well, the affair is on June 2nd, but you would have to go a day or 2 early because it's a long way."</sentence><sentence id="4126">And I said, "Forget it.</sentence><sentence id="4127">Not me.</sentence><sentence id="4128">We're due to have a baby right on June 2nd."</sentence><sentence id="4129">And...uh...he kinda said, "So what?"</sentence><sentence id="4130">And I understood that.</sentence><sentence id="4131">I said, "Well, I wasn't there when the first one was born, and I have solemn advice from my wife that if I am not there when the second one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife.</sentence><sentence id="4132">And I believe her."</sentence><sentence id="4133">And he was a little bit upset, but he accepted that.</sentence><sentence id="4134">As it happens, the child was born on June the Ist so it was very sensible of me to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4135">Those 3 months were exhilarating and exhausting.</sentence><sentence id="4136">And then I settled down for the first time since I had become a Rabbi to be a Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="4137">I accepted a position at our <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> to teach and to get my doctorate and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> and became people for the first time.</sentence><sentence id="4138">No longer did our son Michael get into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pullman berth</span> and say, "<span class="BUILDING">Home</span>," which he had done a number of times when he was 2 years old and traveling constantly.</sentence><sentence id="4139">I'm done.</sentence><sentence id="4140">Finished.</sentence></p></dialogue>
