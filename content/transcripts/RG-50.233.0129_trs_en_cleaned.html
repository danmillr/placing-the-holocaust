used to live there before the war, by the name Boldratt (26).</sentence><sentence id="242">They recommended staying with an elderly person who was handicapped and used a crutch.</sentence><sentence id="243">Boldratt said you may have to help him out many times because sometimes he cannot get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> but once he does get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and you put the crutch under his arm, then he's all right.</sentence><sentence id="244">We stayed with them, with that farmer.</sentence><sentence id="245">Ofcourse, we had to pay him and since we didn't have money to pay him and he didn't want no money .</sentence><sentence id="246">He stay in there and feel that the elements are not going to be against us.</sentence><sentence id="247">I started going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name Bi (64) which was also about 25kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chisava</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">That <span class="REGION">area</span> was called by the Germans, it was not an integrated <span class="REGION">area</span> that they claimed was their possession.</sentence><sentence id="249"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chisava</span> was their possession, Bi _ they claim is a protectorate.</sentence><sentence id="250">They wanted to make the people vote for them in case it will ever come to a vote to show that they are willing to stay with them.</sentence><sentence id="251">That's why they're called protectorate.</sentence><sentence id="252">Germans were hoping that eventually the public was going to be voting for them to remain over there.</sentence><sentence id="253">I went over to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I had my father's cousin by the name Russik (76) and we were told that sugar is in abundance over there.</sentence><sentence id="254">You can get as much as you want.</sentence><sentence id="255">We figured out that I'm going to go, that my friend Bro (80) will stay in the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, justin case something, a message or something else, someone will have to be there.</sentence><sentence id="256">The first trip we had to cross a <span class="DLF">border</span> and it was uneventful.</sentence><sentence id="257">It didn't bother us at all, we just slipped through the <span class="DLF">border</span> and the Russiks were very nice and they accommodated me and helped me also to find the sugar that Ineeded.</sentence><sentence id="258">I spent maybe three or four days over there just to get a little rest and then I started on the way back.</sentence><sentence id="259">The way back was a little harder.</sentence><sentence id="260">We had to hire somebody who would transport the sugar and make sure that that the sugar was not going to be seen.</sentence><sentence id="261">He put some sheep in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and hid the sugar under that <span class="INT_SPACE">double floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">We could not go with him because we were Jews and he was a Pole, and transporting Jews would have caused him problems.</sentence><sentence id="263">I went by myself and a number of other people who would try to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> with someone who knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> and also knew when the guards were changing.</sentence><sentence id="264">We made it across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and I met up with that man who was carrying that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="265">He was recommended by Mr. Russik, who knew him from before the war.</sentence><sentence id="266">He said "He is beyond reproach, you don't have to worry.</sentence><sentence id="267">When you get there, he'll wait for you and he'll have it for you."</sentence><sentence id="268">Sure enough, when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chisava</span>, he told me where he's going to be.</sentence><sentence id="269">There was only one <span class="BUILDING">beer joint</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">He said, "I'm going to be in that <span class="BUILDING">beer joint</span>."</sentence><sentence id="271">I went over to him and he had that stuff for me.</sentence><sentence id="272">I paid him and I made arrangements that I'm going to use him again next time.</sentence><sentence id="273">My friend Bro and I picked it up and we took it over.</sentence><sentence id="274">People were already waiting for it.</sentence><sentence id="275">Of course, not for money but bartering for other foods.</sentence><sentence id="276">What we wanted mainly was bacon and ham.</sentence><sentence id="277">Those are the items that we are lacking, everybody was lacking.</sentence><sentence id="278">But the farmers had it in abundance.</sentence><sentence id="279">They're putting it away and hoarding it.</sentence><sentence id="280">For the sugar, we got all that stuff that we needed.</sentence><sentence id="281">I took off that stuff that we got and we hid it.</sentence><sentence id="282">A few days later, I had a message that my grandmother was very sick and she was not expected to live another day.</sentence><sentence id="283">I filled a knapsack with a number of provisions.</sentence><sentence id="284">My father and my grandmother were very religious and they wouldn't eat it.</sentence><sentence id="285">But the rabbi told them that if it is a life- threatening situation you are allowed to eat haza (pig).</sentence><sentence id="286">I broughtit over and my grandmother, it was like she waited for me.</sentence><sentence id="287">She was still alive but she didn't last the next night.</sentence><sentence id="288">She justfell asleep and never woke up.</sentence><sentence id="289">We went to the funeral and my parents had some provisions.</sentence><sentence id="290">My father wouldn't eat any of that ham or bacon.</sentence><sentence id="291">My mother and my little brother had it.</sentence><sentence id="292">I didn't want to stay long because every so often the Germans used to come and see who is alive and who is dead, to keep track of how many people are still left.</sentence><sentence id="293">I was afraid that if they run into me, I'd be in bad .</sentence><sentence id="299">shape because no young people were there, only elderly people.</sentence><sentence id="300">I slipped away the following night and I went back.</sentence><sentence id="301">Before I left him, my father told me news was spreading that they're going to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="302">It's only a matter of maybe a week, two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="303">I'll let you know.</sentence><sentence id="304">There are always some people that go over there and I'll let you know in plenty of time."</sentence></p></dialogue>
