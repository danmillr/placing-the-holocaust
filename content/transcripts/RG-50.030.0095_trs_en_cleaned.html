<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Do you remember the first time that happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: I think it might have been--I might be off about a year--the second or third year, the second or third grade, possibly.</sentence><sentence id="30">I must have been around 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years old; 10 years old, that period.</sentence><sentence id="31">So it was already before "33, because I think I was 12 years old in 1933 when Hitler came to power.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="102">A: I think early on I must have mentioned something to my sister; but I learned early on that this was a part of growing up as a Jew and in a <span class="REGION">European country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">In a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that has seen anti- Semitism forever.</sentence><sentence id="104">So it was all part of it, and you learn it, and I was not surprised by it anymore.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Your father, I believe, was a World War I veteran.</sentence><sentence id="109">How did he feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and how did he feel about things like this?</sentence><sentence id="110">Did he ever talk about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="114">A: I don't remember talking to my father about it.</sentence><sentence id="115">No.</sentence><sentence id="116">I might have, but I don't remember it.</sentence><sentence id="117">You see, until very recently, until about a year ago, I had a total memory block.</sentence><sentence id="118">And I went to several psychiatrists and psychologists in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Indianapolis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">I didn't...when we were negotiating with the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> government for restitution, loss of property, loss of education, and all that, I could not fill in all the lengthy questionnaires that I was sent by the German government; because I didn't remember the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I attended, I didn't remember the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> I lived on.</sentence><sentence id="120">And if it wouldn't have been followed by a brother, I wouldn't have got a penny.</sentence><sentence id="121">About a year ago, I started writing about it and things started coming back more and more, but there is still some, some <span class="DLF">blocks</span> there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="130">Q: Can you remember the very first time you ever heard about Hitler, not necessarily 1933?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="132">What did he mean to you very early on as a child?</sentence><sentence id="133">Was it ever discussed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or amongst your friends or other Jewish families that you knew?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Well, all I can tell you is that--(cough) excuse me--I should proceed that by saying that I considered myself almost a German, foremost.</sentence><sentence id="135">I had heard about Zionism, and we negated it.</sentence><sentence id="136">I was a German of the Jewish faith.</sentence><sentence id="137">So were my parents.</sentence><sentence id="138">As you said, my father was a veteran of World War I. And when we heard about the Nazis, it was a passing political phenomena.</sentence><sentence id="139">Like many policies.</sentence><sentence id="140">I do remember once, I don't know when it was, some bloody street fights between a communist and the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="141">And I do remember as if it was some sort of pin (ph); and several of my friends, maybe my parents, belonged to the SDP (Social Democratic Party) , which was a majority party, sent .</sentence><sentence id="142">And others wore the Nazi emblem, the Communist emblem, and more than once, I saw the street flights that really were something to behold as far as violence is concerned.</sentence><sentence id="143">Nothing to compare with today, unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="144">But, it was just another party that came into power.</sentence><sentence id="145">I think the Jews by in large were perhaps divided into two camps - the pessimists and the optimists.</sentence><sentence id="146">There were some pessimists that picked up and left in the "30's.</sentence><sentence id="147">All our friends, my families, relatives, couldn't even conceive of leaving in the mid "30's.</sentence><sentence id="148">Why?</sentence><sentence id="149">Everybody lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">Your parents lived there.</sentence><sentence id="151">Your grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="152">Been there for generations who had a vital business.</sentence><sentence id="153">Why would anybody seriously consider leaving?</sentence><sentence id="154">And the Nazis developed their methods so slowly, very slowly, that at least from my perspective, whatever little I remember, there was no forewarning of what was to come.</sentence><sentence id="155">We look at it today with the perspective of hindsight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: When did it first impinge on you?</sentence><sentence id="179">When did you first yourself notice the Nazis or feel that maybe the Nazis were affecting you.</sentence><sentence id="180">Not the street fights?</sentence><sentence id="181">But you yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: I think that was the outgrowth of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>...the Nuremberg Laws.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: It would help me considerably, rather than just answering my question, if you could say something like, "I remember this for me started in Europe."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Okay, I think it was...[ remember it when I was told I could no longer do certain things.</sentence><sentence id="191">I could no longer participate in sports, contact sports.</sentence><sentence id="192">Uh, soccor.</sentence><sentence id="193">I could no longer participate, unless the ski team--I did considerable ski racing; slalom and long distance.</sentence><sentence id="194">I could... It really hit me I wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">I was no longer permitted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">I saw the sign "Jews are Forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="197">Prohibited to Jews."</sentence><sentence id="198">Wherever we went, we saw more and more of the signs.</sentence><sentence id="199">That is when it really hit me that I was not just a German of the Jewish religion.</sentence><sentence id="200">I was different.</sentence><sentence id="201">Which, until that period, it really hadn't sunk in.</sentence><sentence id="202">But then it did.</sentence><sentence id="203">So it was in the mid "30's that I realized that the vise had tightened a little bit, and we were made to stand out and we were different.</sentence><sentence id="204">And made to suffer for it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: Were you made to feel different in the <span class="DLF">street</span>?</sentence><sentence id="221">You weren't allowed to go, how did people respond to you?</sentence><sentence id="222">Did you find it on a personal level that things were changing?</sentence><sentence id="223">Tell me something about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Well, on a personal level, I felt it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in sports and when you wanted to participate in certain public events.</sentence><sentence id="229">I couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="230">So many <span class="REGION">areas</span> were restricted.</sentence><sentence id="231">I think that is the only way I can remember it.</sentence><sentence id="232">I was still active in a very disciplined, highly disciplined, semi-militaristic youth organization, Jewish youth organization by the name of Scwartzefahnlein--Black Pennant [Ger: "Black Squad").</sentence><sentence id="233">I joined it when I was about 8 and one half years old.</sentence><sentence id="234">And as I said, it was a rather militaristic pseudo-scouting organization.</sentence><sentence id="235">And this is when I had really my best times.</sentence><sentence id="236">I enjoyed life tremendously.</sentence><sentence id="237">And I have many, some fond memories.</sentence><sentence id="238">In retrospect, I am surprised that my parents let me go on a 6 weeks hike when I was 8 and one half years old.</sentence><sentence id="239">It was compared to scouting standards, very tough, just to get to scout.</sentence><sentence id="240">I believe I was let loose in the middle of of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> at night, and find your way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">This sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="242">And we tramped...hiked all of the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span> [Pol: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroc_aw</span>] north to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Baltic Sea</span>, then took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> around to bypass a <span class="DLF">Polish corridor</span>, to the lake area of east of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>--as the Polish called it--and hiked to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> where we stayed for 4 weeks.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: This was a Jewish youth organization?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends at this time.</sentence><sentence id="263">Did they change at the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, or didn't you have any non-Jewish friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: Iam glad you asked that.</sentence><sentence id="267">I did have non-Jewish friends, up to about "35.</sentence><sentence id="268">After that, I was absolutely ostracized.</sentence><sentence id="269">I lost all friends I had.</sentence><sentence id="270">I did not exist anymore for my non-Jewish friends.</sentence><sentence id="271">They wouldn't dare to be seen with a Jew.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Did you try to make contact with them or did you retreat"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: Well, I guess in the beginning you walked up to a boy and tried to talk to him like you always did.</sentence><sentence id="289">And you were left standing when he turned around and walked away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: After "35, were you still ?</sentence><sentence id="293">Did you have to give you name, and who you were, and what your father did?</sentence><sentence id="294">Was there any change in response then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="299">No.</sentence><sentence id="300">You see, <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> was very disciplined as it was.</sentence><sentence id="301">and I don't when that incident happened.</sentence><sentence id="302">But to give an example, I don't know it was regular behavior, corporal punishment, I was very good in <span class="BUILDING">gym</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">As a gymnast.</sentence><sentence id="304">And we once did a formation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">calisthenics</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">It was new to me.</sentence><sentence id="306">And I was bad to the kid next to me and watched what it was going to be when it was finished.</sentence><sentence id="307">And the teacher heard it, he walked up to me, and slapped my face and I wound up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I think that's when, perhaps, my hearing suffered somewhat.</sentence><sentence id="308">It is this sort of aggressive behavior by some teachers, was made perhaps more aggressive later than in the beginning, but quite frankly I don't remember exactly what happened where, when.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="320">Q: When did you family start to talk about the changed situation after 1935?</sentence><sentence id="321">Or did they talk?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="324">Was it an unmentioned subject?</sentence><sentence id="325">Did life just carry on?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Life carried on.</sentence><sentence id="327">You have to carry on.</sentence><sentence id="328">And especially on adverse conditions, you carry on.</sentence><sentence id="329">We talked about it occasionally, yes; especially since we had the <span class="BUILDING">matzah factory</span>, which was bolaba (ph).</sentence><sentence id="330">Now it was like many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">Not visible on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">Many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in Europe were in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, which was closed off with a <span class="DLF">iron gate</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="333">You had to have access to it.</sentence><sentence id="334">And then you go through the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was behind it.</sentence><sentence id="335">So it was only those people that knew; but occasionally there was some vandalism.</sentence><sentence id="336">But not much more.</sentence><sentence id="337">Surprisingly, my father, as I said, was a very nice, easy-going, mild- mannered man, who helped a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="338">The factory workers that lived in the <span class="BUILDING">tenement houses</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> that we owned in front of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, they adored him.</sentence><sentence id="339">They would do anything for him.</sentence><sentence id="340">He always helped them out.</sentence><sentence id="341">Give them money.</sentence><sentence id="342">So he never had any problems.</sentence><sentence id="343">Not even at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kristallnacht</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Yah.</sentence><sentence id="397">Well, it was about when I was 14 years old, things got very bad in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="398">I remember the principal coming in once and said, "We don't want the Jew Heppner in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="399">Out!"</sentence><sentence id="400">So I left <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">When I was 14 years old.</sentence><sentence id="402">Iam a kick-out.</sentence><sentence id="403">I took some classes in <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, whatever; and then my mother knew somebody who owned a <span class="DLF">machine yard</span>--industrial machinery, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span>, like all the steam equipment.</sentence><sentence id="404">And everybody at that time learned a practical craft, in preparation for possible immigration.</sentence><sentence id="405">And I was good with my hands.</sentence><sentence id="406">I am almost ambidextrous.</sentence><sentence id="407">Actually, when I was left handed, I was forced to learn my writing with my right hand.</sentence><sentence id="408">So I took several courses.</sentence><sentence id="409">I learned welding, I learned locksmithing, I learned out to pick locks, and then I became a volunteer, (ph), that is the name for it.</sentence><sentence id="410">Not an apprentice, but as an apprentice with minimal pay; because we didn't need the money.</sentence><sentence id="411">My parents knew the owner.</sentence><sentence id="412">So I was working there in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, welding and cutting and working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">I knew how to type.</sentence><sentence id="414">I maintained the petty cash.</sentence><sentence id="415">They had a <span class="BUILDING">gas station</span>; pumped gas, and learned all kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="416">One interesting experience I remember, after I took the course in welding, it was a fairly warm August day, I was asked to cut, with a torch, heavy steam piping.</sentence><sentence id="417">And I took the torch and I didn't have my overhauls and I cut off the umbrella bags, put them around my waist, took a piece of wire and fastened it, and another fella helped me turn the heavy piping while I was cutting away.</sentence><sentence id="418">And I smelled some smoke and the flames started shooting up and ignited the umbrella bags.</sentence><sentence id="419">But I had learned what to do, and I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and rolled and just lost some of my sweater and shirt and eyebrows and hair.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="445">Q: Were your fellow workers Jewish or German or German-Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="473">There was some rumors then, just about that time, after from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radnow</span> (ph) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">vom
