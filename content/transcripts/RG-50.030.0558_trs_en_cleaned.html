nothing.</sentence><sentence id="8">So my two uncles, my mom's brothers, they came to pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="9">It is very important to understand that I was one day -- one day old.</sentence><sentence id="10">My -- my mom was the only daughter, and she had four brothers.</sentence><sentence id="11">Two of them, they took me from that midwife, to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that the family was hiding.</sentence><sentence id="12">And I was crying and crying and crying.</sentence><sentence id="13">By the way, I just learned this all few years ago.</sentence><sentence id="14">I had no idea what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="15">But my uncle who -- who was about to die, finally he felt that he needs to tell me something.</sentence><sentence id="16">So that's how I learned, you know.</sentence><sentence id="17">Today I am 65, and I was probably about 60 when the -- you know, I learned what happened to

were scared that, you know, they gonna be killed because of me.</sentence><sentence id="21">So my grandma, according to my uncle, my grandma decided that I cannot be with them.</sentence><sentence id="22">She came up with an idea that she" Il -- they will put me on -- on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> where people walk by a lot, and somebody will see a crying baby and will take the baby.</sentence><sentence id="23">That's what she was hoping.</sentence><sentence id="24">Well, nothing like this happened.</sentence><sentence id="25">They put me on that frozen ground.</sentence><sentence id="26">It -- you know, the beginning of April in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- I don't even think it was April, cause the -- there is no certain date, you know, that's -- probably it was in March, because it was very, bitterly cold.</sentence><sentence id="27">So they put me, you know, on that cold <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, you know, and they were looking through, you know, sort of the <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, looking at me what's gonna happen.</sentence><sentence id="28">And people were walking -- were walking by, and nobody</sentence><sentence id="30">stopped.</sentence><sentence id="31">Nobody stopped.</sentence><sentence id="32">I was screaming like crazy, they were crying.</sentence><sentence id="33">Finally, after I don't know how many hours, my grandma said no, I -- I cannot do this.</sentence><sentence id="34">She decided, you know, to take me back and when night came, my two uncles took me -- still, you know, screaming, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the lady, very simple woman, who was apparently mentally sick and nobody talked with her.</sentence><sentence id="35">People were scared of her.</sentence><sentence id="36">So she was without of contact with -- with anybody.</sentence><sentence id="37">And her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on the -- on the skirt of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">They took me there, cause they thought, she's alone, maybe she will take the baby.</sentence><sentence id="39">So one year old baby -- I mean, one day old baby -- this is very important and that's why I repeat it, you know, they put me on her steps.</sentence><sentence id="40">I was screaming.</sentence><sentence id="41">She opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, she saw the baby, she took me in.</sentence><sentence id="42">So this was 43.I was in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until "45.</sentence><sentence id="43">No idea how -- how -- what happened during this time.</sentence><sentence id="44">I might suspect that when I was crying, she was beating me up, because, you know, she was scared, too.</sentence><sentence id="45">So, actually -- okay, of course, there was no milk.</sentence><sentence id="46">I was feeding, you know, with potatoes and water.</sentence><sentence id="47">I don't know how this happened that I survived.</sentence><sentence id="48">It's -- I've talked to the doctors, they say they never heard about such a thing.</sentence><sentence id="49">But anyhow, what happened during these two years, my mom, of course -- my father was in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, hiding there.</sentence><sentence id="50">And my mom was very depressed.</sentence><sentence id="51">She was 19.She lost her baby, which she never touched.</sentence><sentence id="52">She didn't have parents and family.</sentence><sentence id="53">So she, one day she decided to go where they were hiding to see her mom and her dad.</sentence><sentence id="54">And the people who in the meantime took over

which was</sentence><sentence id="57">ontectnetonancedjusetneey for tarher biormatoerabouttfisotecion working very close with Gestapo, and th-the Germans came, killed almost everybody immediately.</sentence><sentence id="58">My two uncles, they were not there, they were hiding in the <span class="DLF">fields</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">So my mom, apparently that they -- they didn't kill her at once, but she was hurt badly.</sentence><sentence id="60">And a few years ago, I went there.</sentence><sentence id="61">I was told not to by many people, because the people living there, they remember the family.</sentence><sentence id="62">They stole everything which belongs to us, and I was told it's dangerous to -- even to be around, especially that I look hundred percent like my dad, so I am very easy to recognize.</sentence><sentence id="63">But I did, I go, I did go there.</sentence><sentence id="64">And I saw -- I met li--a lady who was -- I was just asking million questions, you know, and just between one sentence and the other, she told me about my family.</sentence><sentence id="65">I couldn't believe my ears, but I -- I didn't even ask about the family.</sentence><sentence id="66">But she started to say, oh, we've had the Jews, you know, here.</sentence><sentence id="67">There were parents and five kids, you know.</sentence><sentence id="68">There was one -- one girl and four brothers.</sentence><sentence id="69">And that girl, she had a baby that's -- the lady is telling me, you know, I am standing in front of her.</sentence><sentence id="70">And -- and she says, but that baby for sure didn't survive, she says.</sentence><sentence id="71">And she says, I will never forget the scene the day they killed all -- all that family, you know, hiding there.</sentence><sentence id="72">And she was not killed immediately, but she was hurt badly.</sentence><sentence id="73">And she had the long hair.</sentence><sentence id="74">They grabbed her, you know, for the hair, and they were dragging her through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the nearest <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">And they then -- she was killed there.</sentence><sentence id="76">And that woman tells me, you know, I -- this --I--I can see like today, you know, that blood, you know, behind this woman.</sentence><sentence id="77">She had no idea who she talking to, and I had a dilemma, you know.</sentence><sentence id="78">I -- I wasn't sure -- I mean,</sentence><sentence id="80">ontectreferannetaushariarg tr hither btrmedortabeat fielder that was no time to think it over, but I-- you know, I wanted to do something with this, so before I left, you know -- I was with my husband, by the way, he is Polish, and he was shocked even more than I was.</sentence><sentence id="81">And my
