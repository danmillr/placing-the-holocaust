Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid and they used to lock their <span class="DLF">doors</span> because what they preached mostly in the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">When they come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but otherwise we didn't have any problems.(c).</sentence><sentence id="6">Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at this point?A. No, we were aware very little of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">Even when the Germans came in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they closed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="8">Q. How large was your town?A. Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had about close to 10,000 population.</sentence><sentence id="9">4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50 percent.</sentence><sentence id="10">Q. Business and that was fairly integrated?A. Right.</sentence><sentence id="11">Q.

We ran out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, then we had to get another <span class="NPIP">place</span> Sam Spiegal 4 May 3, 1995 to live.</sentence><sentence id="13">I think we moved in with our grandmother for a little while in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> just to stay until things straightened a little bit out.</sentence><sentence id="14">Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick in 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and nobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus.</sentence><sentence id="15">Then I worked for the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because the Germans, when they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, made like the Judenaut which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> over there for them, until I sent away to , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">Things got very bad in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">There was a lot of sickness, a lot of poverty.</sentence><sentence id="18">We didn't get enough food to eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as much as we could as a community.</sentence><sentence id="19">Because we still lived in our own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and we had some little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I even had a paper that I could go outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, because I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I worked in the labor department, in that section.</sentence><sentence id="20">I could see what started going on and I was very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too long, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, this was before they took all the Jewish people out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">The fellow that took me out from there was an SS man by the name of .</sentence><sentence id="22">He said we have to go to , because there's a big <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> and Sam Spiegal 5 May 3, 1995 we'll have to send a lot of people over there to work.</sentence><sentence id="23">We have to go over and see how things are set up over there.</sentence><sentence id="24">When I came over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said Monday maybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to go back anymore because all the Jewish people from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="25">That's how I stayed over there.</sentence><sentence id="26">All the time I was in for about two years.</sentence><sentence id="27">Sam Spiegal 6 May 3, 1995 into the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">Life was very difficult in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">You couldn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="30">There was no work.</sentence><sentence id="31">Nobody was working except when the Germans took you out to work somewhere on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, but you still used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night and be with your family.</sentence><sentence id="32">That was one good thing about it.</sentence><sentence id="33">You always had hope.</sentence><sentence id="34">You figured it's a war, maybe the war is going to finish tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="35">Maybe things are going to change.</sentence><sentence id="36">We also felt that we have to stick together in order to keep each other alive and maybe things are going to change a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="37">Q. What about activities in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, cultural activities, religion, your father's political -- A. All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out that you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="38">You were afraid even to go out into the <span class="DLF">street</span> during the day because they would catch you all the time and send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could.</sentence><sentence id="39">They used to come in every day to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and do what they want to, anda lot of people got killed.</sentence><sentence id="40">If they didn't like somebody, they just killed them in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">It didn't make any difference.</sentence><sentence id="42">Os Did you see that?A. Oh, sure, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="43">I remember the name.</sentence><sentence id="44">He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the name of Schmitky, they used Sam Spiegal a May 3, 1995 to call him.</sentence><sentence id="45">He was a very, very cruel man.</sentence><sentence id="46">He just came out.</sentence><sentence id="47">I remember right near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil Littman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">We were sitting <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="49">We were afraid even to go out.</sentence><sentence id="50">So those things were going on daily.</sentence><sentence id="51">It was a daily occurrence.</sentence><sentence id="52">It wasn't new.</sentence><sentence id="53">Q. Did your father keep up any this organizing underground, the Zionism?A. I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="54">It's true that they got together and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there was no help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> without help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, it was very hard to organize anything, especially ina small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like ours.(c).</sentence><sentence id="56">Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?A. We used to observe it in the way we could.</sentence><sentence id="57">I remember my mother used to light candles every Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had before the war.</sentence><sentence id="58">If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to survive.</sentence><sentence id="59">I used to help a little bit because I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my portion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> instead of eating so I can help out the family a little bit.(c).</sentence><sentence id="60">Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?A. The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the Sam Spiegal 8 May 3, 1995 Judenaut, was a very good friend of my father's, and that's how I got the job.</sentence><sentence id="61">It wasn't easy to get a job like this, because usually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and all the food and everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece of bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself.</sentence><sentence id="62">I brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because I knew the rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means to get their food from.(c).</sentence><sentence id="63">What other privileges did you get from working there?A. The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, if I had to go out for something.</sentence><sentence id="64">If you get out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, because you mix with the Gentile people <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you could help yourself a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="65">Q. Were you able to help your family by virtue of your <span class="NPIP">position</span> other than the food?A. No, not much.</sentence><sentence id="66">I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which they worked at , and it was named , the firm.</sentence><sentence id="67">But what happened, Sam Spiegal 9 May 3, 1995 A.

You hear stories about Judenauts and various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">Some of them were very helpful to the community, some of them were trying to save their own lives.</sentence><sentence id="72">How do you kind of assess how your Judenaut operated?A. We knew it was a very difficult time.</sentence><sentence id="73">You have to understand what was going on in those days.</sentence><sentence id="74">You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do.</sentence><sentence id="75">If they came in and saw the President of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to supply those 200 people.</sentence><sentence id="76">So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they said why take me?</sentence><sentence id="77">Why not take somebody else?</sentence><sentence id="78">You're put in the position that if you do right or you do wrong, you're not right.</sentence><sentence id="79">I'm sure that you heard that , which was the President, Sam Spiegal 10 May 3, 1995 lose their life.</sentence><sentence id="80">Os Now, you worked in the labor department?A. Right.</sentence><sentence id="81">The labor department, for instance, the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="82">They said we want 200 people tomorrow to go to work tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from the register that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are going the next day.</sentence><sentence id="83">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't really the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work.</sentence><sentence id="84">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">Os But how were those choices made, which 200?A. They usually were made according the list that we had.</sentence><sentence id="86">The way the President of the Judenaut decided or the people on top of them.</sentence><sentence id="87">I was young.</sentence><sentence id="88">I was 17 years old.</sentence><sentence id="89">I didn't make the big decisions.</sentence><sentence id="90">They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those people we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who is a little better off or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help other people they should stay in <span class="NPIP">place</span> to help them, instead of sending them out of town.(c).</sentence><sentence id="91">Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200?A. Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we made choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go.</sentence><sentence id="92">I Sam Spiegal 11 May 3, 1995 mentioned that there were certain people who were privileged.</sentence><sentence id="93">If he had some in his family, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="94">He picked them out to go to a job that was a little easier.</sentence><sentence id="95">I imagine everybody did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="96">If I could help some of my friends, I helped them.</sentence><sentence id="97">If I could help somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="98">Q. Were there women in the Judenaut?A. No, not too many that I can remember.</sentence><sentence id="99">Q. Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut toward other people because of their special power?A. I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="100">There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher echelon to be able to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="101">Os The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?A. That's right.</sentence><sentence id="102">They used to dispense the food.</sentence><sentence id="103">They used to get it, and then divide it.</sentence><sentence id="104">The people used to have little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or twice a week.</sentence><sentence id="105">We also had <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> that we set up in order to help the people that didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to cook or couldn't help themselves.(c).</sentence><sentence id="106">Anything else about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> that you can think of?A. The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had anything, if they heard about a good job that was <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, that the Germans took you away, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were Sam Spiegal 12 May 3, 1995 going to take you to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="107">They said we have here, we need some people to send out the job.</sentence><sentence id="108">We're going to take you and you're going to be living over there and you're going to be all right.</sentence><sentence id="109">So, a lot of people even went by themselves because they figured they would be better off than being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="110">You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and sickness going on.</sentence><sentence id="111">We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that they're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself.@. So, you were already in ?</sentence><sentence id="112">Sam Spiegal 13 May 3, 1995 Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and he could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="113">We found out after the war that the fellow that was in charge of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over there, he was a German by the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was a little bit better, that we didn't suffer as much as in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">He was caught after the war in the and he was telling the things that he was doing for us.</sentence><sentence id="115">I know when they took us away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and told them that , we were very good workers and we know Sam Spiegal 14 May 3, 1995 and luckily it was showers and not gas.</sentence><sentence id="116">We came out from there and they numbered us and they put us in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">Then, people came in from <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> because the Germans, this was in 1944, a lot of the Germans went up on the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> and they needed people to replace them at their <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, so they needed workers.</sentence><sentence id="118">So they came in from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, this is Sam Spiegal 15 May 3, 1995 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and they bunked a lot of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, they brought a lot of our men to the <span class="BUILDING">train factory</span> to be fixed.</sentence><sentence id="119">The soldiers that were in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, came with them.</sentence><sentence id="120">They usually waited until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were fixed, so they put on another shift.</sentence><sentence id="121">Before they put on another shift, the SS man came in.</sentence><sentence id="122">His name was Fox.</sentence><sentence id="123">He said, each one he assigned us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, a pullman to go out and check on those pullman.</sentence><sentence id="124">I went out to mine because I didn't know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I showed him where the damage was and what we're going to fix.</sentence><sentence id="125">When he came on and asked everybody what to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the second shift.</sentence><sentence id="126">I couldn't tell the men.</sentence><sentence id="127">I took the bull by the horn.</sentence><sentence id="128">I figured listen I had to take a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift.</sentence><sentence id="129">We went out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I never smoked.</sentence><sentence id="130">Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people.</sentence><sentence id="131">They knew that I didn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I was put in charge, I was put in charge over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">That's where I learned my trade.</sentence><sentence id="133">When I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington DC</span> and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when I came over here.</sentence><sentence id="134">Q.

<span class="DLF">gate</span> a lot of times.</sentence><sentence id="149">He used to knock me on the shoulders when we went out.</sentence><sentence id="150">That's how I survived from going to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> one time.</sentence><sentence id="151">We had to think sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="152">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was

very bad.</sentence><sentence id="157">We used to get a little piece of bread in the morning and we used to get little bit of soup at night.</sentence><sentence id="158">But, like I told you, we tried to help each other in order to keep our <span class="NPIP">things</span> a little bit up.</sentence><sentence id="159">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, it was altogether different.</sentence><sentence id="160">It was hard to believe what was going on over there.</sentence><sentence id="161">We could see the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">We could smell the smoke.</sentence><sentence id="163">We knew the people that were taken over there.</sentence><sentence id="164">We were ones of the lucky ones.</sentence><sentence id="165">The minute we got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they started chasing us and they gave us the numbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and then they put us
