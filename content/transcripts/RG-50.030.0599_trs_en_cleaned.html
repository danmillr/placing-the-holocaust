<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: So it's really long.</sentence><sentence id="334">It's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="335">But she -- the reason I was picked for this is because of this interview that I did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">She ran -- she read through all these archives, all these interviews --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="337">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="338">A: -- and said, I need somebody who has been kicked out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who was a hero in the first world war.</sentence><sentence id="339">They really wanted to interview my father, but because he wasn't alive anymore, so they settled with me.</sentence><sentence id="340">And one of the -- one of the episodes of my life that they -- they staged in this film with somebody portraying the young kid -- nine year old kid portraying me, which might be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to go back to remember things.</sentence><sentence id="341">I remembered very clearly the Gestapo coming in and surveying all our belongings, which they did.</sentence><sentence id="342">I still have a list of -- a very, very detailed list.</sentence><sentence id="343">So many handkerchiefs, so much linen, so many knives, forks, and spoons; all the inventory.</sentence><sentence id="344">Most of which was confiscated.</sentence><sentence id="345">Ones -- we were allowed to take one knife, fork, and spoon per person.</sentence><sentence id="346">For a family of five we could take five things with us.</sentence><sentence id="347">And anything of value that they wanted too, any ornamentation that we had around.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="348">And we had a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span>, a carved glass <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> with a gold rim on the top.</sentence><sentence id="349">And I noticed they were going through getting anything -- any metals of any value, silver or gold, or anything that they were confiscating.</sentence><sentence id="350">So while they were rummaging through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- I was watching this -- I took this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> and held it under the kitchen faucet under hot water and wanted to see if the rim would come off.</sentence><sentence id="351">And tapped it, and believe it or not, the rim came right off.</sentence><sentence id="352">So they took the rim and they left us the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">We still have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="354">They were only interested in the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: -- in the metal part.</sentence><sentence id="357">Not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">It's a large carved glass <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">I thought it was quite handsome.</sentence><sentence id="360">Anyway, that part they staged in this -- in this little film, the history of the Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="361">I'm not sure what else I can tell you except the thought of this has never -- the thought of our background is somehow never very far from -- from my -- I've been a Professor of Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I've concentrated on minority populations.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="362">I guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background of minorities.</sentence><sentence id="363">And we do talk to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> groups and college groups and various groups in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Californi</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: I would like to do that.</sentence><sentence id="365">I haven't done that yet in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="390">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="391">I've never quite figured out.</sentence><sentence id="392">And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after your parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have asked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore.</sentence><sentence id="393">But I was relatively frail, underweight and very skinny.</sentence><sentence id="394">And for some reason or another, my parents decided to keep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather.</sentence><sentence id="395">Maybe they felt I was too young.</sentence><sentence id="396">My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the Kindertransport by her mother, you know.</sentence><sentence id="397">It's also very, very hard for me to conceive, as a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the unknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing with you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving your child to this...

id="857">And I have to admit that the whole experience probably made me more Jewish than I would have been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because we are relatively secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do belong to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> here as we did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, but it's reformed.</sentence><sentence id="858">As you know, Jews have reformed conservative and orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="859">So it's very much on the liberal or reformed side here.</sentence><sentence id="860">But certainly, I felt more Jewish because of what's happened there.</sentence><sentence id="861">It was interesting when we first came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- this was almost a couple years before Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war in Europe broke out.</sentence><sentence id="862">We arrived on August Ist.</sentence><sentence id="863">The war started September 1, 1939.And we were treated as enemy aliens here.</sentence><sentence id="864">We were considered German.</sentence><sentence id="865">When the Japanese were deported from the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> after Pearl Harbor, there was serious talk about doing the same thing with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="866">They never did it because our skin color was not so obviously different from everybody else's skin color, but there was serious talk about also doing that.</sentence><sentence id="867">I remember the FBI coming into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>, confiscating a Grundig radio that we had brought over because they thought it might receive shortwave.</sentence><sentence id="868">It didn't receive shortwave of course, but they confiscated it anyway.</sentence><sentence id="869">So at this time the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was marching up and down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> holding demonstrations.</sentence><sentence id="870">So <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> really had not a clue as to what was really happening there at all.</sentence><sentence id="871">And I was very instrumental in our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="872">We just finished building the very first LEED certified <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the world.</sentence><sentence id="873">A LEED is an international standard for rating energy efficient <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">It simply means Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.</sentence><sentence id="875">And so I was quite instrumental in getting that designed and built and LEED certified.</sentence><sentence id="876">So Lam active in that respect.</sentence><sentence id="877">I think the effect that this whole thing has had on me more is to -- is to really be very, very conscious of any type -- any types of discrimination.</sentence><sentence id="878">Right now I'm working closely with a Moslem group which is getting a lot of prejudice in our <span class="REGION">area</span>, and in many <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="879">Kids are being picked on in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">There's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of the same kind of ignorant prejudice.</sentence><sentence id="881">It comes really out of ignorance more than anything else, of not understanding and not even wanting to understand.</sentence><sentence id="882">You know, when I went back in the military to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I was</sentence><sentence id="884">the first Jew that many Germans had ever met, or had any contact with whatsoever, you know.</sentence><sentence id="885">But when they said, we had no idea of what was really going on, that was very questionable, because they -- well, maybe they knew enough not to ask the right questions.</sentence><sentence id="886">That was -- but they did see their neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="887">One thing I left out is that after I got out of the US Army, I took what was known at the time as a GI Bill of Rights which allows you to study.</sentence><sentence id="888">They give you a small stipend.</sentence><sentence id="889">I think it was $150 a month, which would make it very difficult to study in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> at a <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, but I could do graduate work in architecture in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">So against my father's best wishes, I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and spent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture.</sentence><sentence id="891">Had a very, very international class, a master's program in architecture.</sentence><sentence id="892">And a professor, who had fought on the front in the -- Sep Ruf, a well known architect in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, who had fought on the front.</sentence><sentence id="893">And one weekend decided to put us all in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, which is just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="894">And he insisted that I ride with him in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="895">And he tried to make a strong case for the fact that he was a soldier on the front, an officer on the front, and not really knowing what was happening back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, as far as the Jewish problem.</sentence><sentence id="896">I still -- I still have suspicions that if they wanted to find out what was happening, not only to the Jews at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but to the Jews of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that were -- that they were occupying during the war, they could easily find out.</sentence><sentence id="897">Even an -- even an artillery officer could find that out, what was really going on.</sentence><sentence id="898">But he took us to the <span class="DLF">memorial</span>.</sentence><sentence id="899">And explained to us all -- the <span class="DLF">memorial</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> had just been built.</sentence><sentence id="900">It was a very -- it was a very emotional trip.</sentence><sentence id="901">I was the only Jew in that architecture group, but the group was -- only included two Germans.</sentence><sentence id="902">The rest were from, really, all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="903">They had students from everywhere that came together and had a chance to experience that very, very powerful visit.</sentence><sentence id="904">And they seemed to -- beginning to really understand what -- what kind of mass hysteria had taken place there, even though this was just ten years after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: As far as getting back to the faith issue, there is a -- there is a -- a Jewish saying of attempting to heal the world, of acting in such a way, behaving throughout your life in such a way, it's tikkun olam, which means to heal the world.</sentence><sentence id="962">And in some small ways you're supposed -- ideally, it's to lead a life that would help to do that.</sentence><sentence id="963">So I've gotten very involved in, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, working with the homeless issue, which is prevalent in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> also, and in creating a sustainable <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that does a little bit maybe to heal the environment.</sentence><sentence id="964">And it was -- by the way, it was the first LEED certified <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the world.</sentence><sentence id="965">And hopefully -- and since then -- this was three years ago it was -- it was certified.</sentence><sentence id="966">And since then there have been many others that have also been certified.</sentence><sentence id="967">So if any affect it had on me, it's made me conscious of individual prejudices.</sentence><sentence id="968">When my</sentence><sentence id="970">wife and I talk to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> we try to get this across to kids as to picking on.</sentence><sentence id="971">Right now there's a big thing all over the news about bullying and what -- what harm that can do.</sentence><sentence id="972">Bullying because of -- you're gay, or because they're <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moslem</span> or because you're different from -- from the -- so the idea of differences and how we -- how we treat differences and how we only seem to gravitate to our own kind all the time needs to be addressed.</sentence><sentence id="973">And I think very slowly it is, but you know, it's very dangerous what's happening in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right now because when they say that the hysteria of Naziism was only because the Germans are so focused on the fuhrer, on a leader, that they will follow the leader over any <span class="DLF">precipice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">Some of the things we're seeing now, some of the prejudices we see with the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> being proposed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and what have you, it could happen here just as easily I think as -- as having anything happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 1930s.</sentence><sentence id="975">So we're not -- we're not above that.</sentence><sentence id="976">There are an awful lot of -- well, I won't get into politics too much, but -- okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
