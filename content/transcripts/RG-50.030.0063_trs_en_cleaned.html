<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: Robert, can you just tell me your name and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Well, I'm Robert Mills Donihi D-O-N-I-H-I, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erie</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>, May 18, 1915.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: What I would like to do is to get into that period of your life where you were about to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">Tell me how it is that you got involved in the trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: Almost accidentally.</sentence><sentence id="12">The Tennessee Bar Association -- I was practicing law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span>, and was an officer, I was actually the acting president of the Junior Bar Association.</sentence><sentence id="13">All the lawyer under 35 sort of grouped together and held our separate meetings at the State Bar meetings.</sentence><sentence id="14">We were having a meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> that year, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="15">I had been practicing for five years.</sentence><sentence id="16">The keynote speaker at the convention was Tom Clark, who was the Attorney General of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">I met Mr. Clark while I was there, and he invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with him, when he finished his speech, and he was going to introduce me or present me to the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">Having completed five years of practice, I was eligible to be sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court.</sentence><sentence id="19">That was quite an honor because every lawyer likes to have an Attorney General sign his submission and diploma.</sentence><sentence id="20">When we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, I was told by the Army people, who were in charge of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, that inasmuch as I didn't have orders that I wouldn't be able to ride.</sentence><sentence id="21">Well, I didn't feel like taking commercial that particular moment, so Mr. Clark suggested that I contact him when I arrived back at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and made a decision on when I'd be coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">I had a case that was going to be coming up at the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>, and I wanted to be there for that occasion, a little later.</sentence><sentence id="23">I think it might have been along about September, October, and another lawyer and I were scheduled to go together.</sentence><sentence id="24">A chap by the name of Whitworth Stokes, another prominent lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span>.</sentence><sentence id="25">We were staying at the <span class="BUILDING">Carlton Hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and I proceeded over to General Clark's office, went with him to the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>, was presented.</sentence><sentence id="26"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stokes</span> was present.</sentence><sentence id="27">As we came out onto the <span class="DLF">steps</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>, to my surprise Clark turned to Stokes and said, "Well, are you going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="28">Stokes said, "I'm sorry, but I would very much like to go, but my wife is opposed to it.</sentence><sentence id="29">Why don't you ask Bob."</sentence><sentence id="30">And he said, "Would you like to go?"</sentence><sentence id="31">And he didn't ask me to go, but he would ask if I would like to go.</sentence><sentence id="32">And I said yes I would but I would need ask my family.</sentence><sentence id="33">He said if you're interested, be in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at 1:00 today.</sentence><sentence id="34">So, we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">I made calls <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I recall the day was of course a landmark thing for me.</sentence><sentence id="36">My family said yes.</sentence><sentence id="37">I told them that I had been told that it would be about 90 days of work, and that seemed like a sort of leg up in my profession.</sentence><sentence id="38">I didn't expect it to be a very prominent kind of position, but I didn't even know what it would be except that it would be working with the Justice Department mission.</sentence><sentence id="39">And my family said okay if it was only going to be for 90 days, why fine.</sentence><sentence id="40">So, we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tureen</span>, if I remember well, of French onion soup sent up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span>, and when I finished it, we decided I would go and went over to <span class="BUILDING">Clark's office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">He had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> to speak to an American Bar Association meeting.</sentence><sentence id="42">Alice O'Donnell and Grace Murphy, who were his chief secretary and Administrative Assistant there, had been told by him that I might be coming and they were expecting me and they called the Chief of what was known as "Project K" as I learned later, for Keenan.</sentence><sentence id="43">Keenan was former head of the criminal division of the <span class="BUILDING">Department of Justice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">He had been Roosevelt's right arm, as liaison to the <span class="BUILDING">Senate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">He had a particular friendship with Senator McKeller of <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span>, whom I knew, and Senator McKeller was Chairman of the Senate, a very powerful Senate Finance Committee.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, Keenan was known by Roosevelt as Joe the Key because he was able to get Roosevelt's economic packages through the Senate with relative friendly ease.</sentence><sentence id="47">That was very important to the President.</sentence><sentence id="48">Keenan was known as a king maker in those days.</sentence><sentence id="49">I think his name today, all these years later, has very little significance, but at that time he was known by people to have recommended persons through the United States Supreme Court to the Cabinet and high positions otherwise, and known as a king maker.</sentence><sentence id="50">So, Keenan had been called by the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> staff, either Alice O'Donnell or Grace Murphy saying that I was coming down, and I remember the language well.</sentence><sentence id="51">She said the Attorney General wants Mr. Donihi to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">So, I went down.</sentence><sentence id="53">I didn't know at that time, but Senator McKeller had been contacted by Keenan and McKeller recommended me very highly.</sentence><sentence id="54">I didn't know that myself, because I later contacted one of our Senators who in turn again contacted McKeller.</sentence><sentence id="55">But in any case, Keenan was influenced by the fact that McKeller -- he had the option of choosing me or not choosing me.</sentence><sentence id="56">Apparently they began a process of investigating and I went back, not knowing what was going to happen, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">In fact, his Deputy, a chap by the name of John Darcian, Assistant Attorney General, was very discouraging.</sentence><sentence id="58">He said we have no money to employ you because it's a Justice Department Staff man that's going; as we have no funds.</sentence><sentence id="59">There's no use even talking about it.</sentence><sentence id="60">He was trying to discourage me from even wanting to go.</sentence><sentence id="61">So, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> not knowing.</sentence><sentence id="62">Subsequently--but I did make a contact with Senator Tom Stewart, our Junior Senator from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> who said, "Well, I'll talk to Senator McKeller and we'll get a recommendation over to the Attorney General."</sentence><sentence id="63">I didn't realize that Keenan had already received a recommendation.</sentence><sentence id="64">So, that really sort of nailed it for me.</sentence><sentence id="65">I was unaware of why or how, but patronage does seem to work that way, and I arrived back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> some days or weeks later there was a telegram that came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stokes</span>, saying that if you are not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> please contact Donihi.</sentence><sentence id="66">So he called and said, "They seem to want you.</sentence><sentence id="67">I called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">They told me they were processing at a given date in November.</sentence><sentence id="69">I came up, and then I was sworn to secrecy on everything.</sentence><sentence id="70">You can't tell anyone that you're employed or what's going to happen or anything.</sentence><sentence id="71">It was "Project K." And I recall very well going up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, there was an army captain who's father had been a United States Senator from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">In fact his father had captured the Kaiser in World War I and became famous as a result, and that sort of propelled him into political life.</sentence><sentence id="73">He became a U.S. Senator and a Financier in <span class="BUILDING">Rogers Coldwell firm</span>, Duke Lee, Jr. was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and I recall that he said, "What takes you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, Bob?"</sentence><sentence id="74">And I said, "Oh, just some routine business."</sentence><sentence id="75">At the end of the day we were on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, or the next day it was, we were on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> and he said, "Bob, did you have anything unusual happening in your day?"</sentence><sentence id="76">I said, "No, no, just routine, how about you?"</sentence><sentence id="77">The same thing.</sentence><sentence id="78">The next day to our mutual embarrassment, our pictures appear side by side in the National Tennessean telling the story and that's the first time I knew exactly what I was going to be doing.</sentence><sentence id="79">That we would be ring side in the trial of the Emperor if he was tried.</sentence><sentence id="80">I was sort of flabbergasted, because so far as I knew "Project K" had nothing but a name.</sentence><sentence id="81">Stokes seemed to think it would have something to do with the rewriting, recodifying of the laws of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, which wouldn't quite have been my thing, but I would have been glad to have the experience.</sentence><sentence id="82">The other, trial law, more my forte, I was happy to have an opportunity to work with lawyers who were more experienced of course.</sentence><sentence id="83">Well, that was it.</sentence><sentence id="84">I went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> expecting to carry books mostly and briefcases for some of the more experienced lawyers, but to my happy surprise, I was used in the trial itself as one of the trial counsel.</sentence><sentence id="85">In a project known, as let's see it wasn't a project, we divided it into phases and it was called the "Preparation of Japanese Opinion for War Phases, Police Control, Censorship" that sort of thing, and that was my phase, the very beginning of the trial.</sentence><sentence id="86">The trial became the longest in history at that time.</sentence><sentence id="87">I guess it still is.</sentence><sentence id="88">| was only there for one year, but you know, the 90 days were interrupted by a tragedy in my own family, and I had to keep working because we needed the funds.</sentence><sentence id="89">So, I kept working until it was possible to get my family together again.</sentence><sentence id="90">We had a tragic fire at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">So, fortunately I was making what then was considered to be very good money.</sentence><sentence id="92">I was able to send every penny <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because everything was taken care of in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, my board, my laundry, my driver, my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, my PX supplies, everything was handed to me.</sentence><sentence id="93">There was no reason for money at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="177">Q: When were you assigned to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, what was the year?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="179">A: Well, we arrived there on Pearl Harbor day of 1945, which was on the anniversary, the fourth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="180">Actually at Pearl Harbor, it would have been December 7.</sentence><sentence id="181">In <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> it was December 8, because of the <span class="DLF">time line</span> difference, one day.</sentence><sentence id="182">So, we arrived there I presume for whatever that propogandic value that might have to be there precisely on the day, four years to the day later.</sentence><sentence id="183">That trial was much different than the trials in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for me because we were a twelve nation trial.</sentence><sentence id="184">The Judges -- there were eleven judges on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, one of them representing two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">Eleven chief prosecutors from the various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, so my job, I had several bosses and all of them telling me what to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Did you know prior to coming about the <span class="BUILDING">war crimes commission</span>?</sentence><sentence id="194">Did you learn about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: Of course all lawyers had some concept, if you were interested at all in world affairs, you knew what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="198">These world affairs and the war trials and the war crimes, the London Conference, the Cairo Conference, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="199">Yes, I had some knowledge of it.</sentence><sentence id="200">I never dreamed that I'd be involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="201">First of all, I had no proficiency in Japanese whatever.</sentence><sentence id="202">I didn't know German at all.</sentence><sentence id="203">I spoke some Russian and Spanish, and of course that didn't suit me for either of the assignments, but I did find that English was the official language of the trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">And everything was on a simultaneous translation basis.</sentence><sentence id="205">We had soundtracks when we were standing at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> wearing headphones.</sentence><sentence id="206">Sorry I don't have pictures that show, yes I do think I have one, but the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, the U.S. VA Graduate School, which I'll be teaching a course in foreign affairs in a few weeks, they had that picture and they were going to return it to me.</sentence><sentence id="207">It's the only one I had of me while I was trying -- it turned out not to be the Emperor of course.</sentence><sentence id="208">As you know, politically, he was excused from the trial.</sentence><sentence id="209">He wasn't tried, he wasn't indicted.</sentence><sentence id="210">We tried Tojo as the lead person and all of the other 27 who were high ranking officers, we thought the top people.</sentence><sentence id="211">There were many other trials, but they were in another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span>, some in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">This was only one international trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>--the Tojo case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Can you tell me something about the preparation of that trial and what it was that you did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, we were broken into several phases.</sentence><sentence id="232">Preparation for Japanese opinion for war being the phase the I was assigned to.</sentence><sentence id="233">There were several of us, three lawyers actually, who were working on that phase, and I had the duty of interviewing people who were related to the press, the movie industry.</sentence><sentence id="234">We didn't have television in those days, and the newspapers and all of the various media used in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to bring about the raising of antipathy against the western nations, preparation for war, actually.</sentence><sentence id="235">To prepare the Japanese mind to accept this, because there had been a lot of pro-western feeling, I think, mostly pro-American feeling, by even a lot of the top leaders in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">The strata of administration of the trial with Keenan as chief American counsel also elected by his peers to be chief prosecutor of the international prosecution section as we were known a part of SCAPs, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Power which translates to MacArthur.</sentence><sentence id="237">Actually, although MacArthur is historically given credit for the trials, it's sort of a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="238">In fact, Keenan's orders, own orders were equal to those of MacArthur.</sentence><sentence id="239">They were presidential orders.</sentence><sentence id="240">I think all of the people who are aware of that period know that President Truman was not reluctant to fire the supreme commander of the Allied Powers, so the title didn't have a whole lot to do with whether or not the President was able to fork his will on the individuals who were American citizens.</sentence><sentence id="241">So, Keenan's presidential orders were equal to those of MacArthur.</sentence><sentence id="242">But, Keenan I think, to my sorrow at the time and continued, Keenan apparently felt reluctant, maybe it was on presidential instructions, but Keenan seemed to be reluctant to go off on his own.</sentence><sentence id="243">He sort of surrendered his authority to MacArthur when we got there, and became a part of the Supreme Command.</sentence><sentence id="244">So, instead of being the International Prosecution Section for the <span class="REGION">Far East</span>, it became a part of the Supreme Commander staff, even though we were called International Prosecution Section, it was the <span class="BUILDING">General Headquarters</span>, MacArthur.</sentence><sentence id="245">This had a very distinct, I think probably a weakening effect of the end results of the trial, because here we had all of the constituent members of what became the United Nations Security Council, were there on the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">You had <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and the Soviet Union and Great Britain and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">All of the <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> who were vying for top authority within the Security Council were there and could have taken it upon themselves at that point to become the United Nations representative in International War Crimes Trials.</sentence><sentence id="248">But you see, that didn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="249">It became more or less an American show because it was McArther.</sentence><sentence id="250">Even though we had the other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> in, it was international only to a limited extent.</sentence><sentence id="251">The American dollar was paying for it, which I guess, had to be expected.</sentence><sentence id="252">We had no subsequent proceedings.</sentence><sentence id="253">I'm getting a little ahead of myself because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the same thing prevailed, incidentally.</sentence><sentence id="254">It was also a part of the military.</sentence><sentence id="255">It was <span class="BUILDING">International Military Tribunal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">We were International Military Tribunal for the <span class="REGION">Far East</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">When the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, after Justice Jackson had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he had been the chief prosecutor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the Soviets had withdrawn, gone back to their zone of operation, so had the French, so had the British, leaving whatever was left of the American staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> under the charge of a very competent lawyer by the name of Telford Taylor, who still lives and who's at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia teaching</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">He must be in his 90s by now.</sentence><sentence id="259">He's a very capable lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="260">But he decided, for whatever reasons, possibly again on I don't know if it was Presidential orders, but for whatever reason, he decided that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> should continue in an international vein.</sentence><sentence id="261">That is, all the trials that would be held at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> under his direction from then on were to be called international trials.</sentence><sentence id="262">His <span class="BUILDING">tribunals</span> would all be known as international military tribunals.</sentence><sentence id="263">It was sort of a fiction because they were manned only by Americans who are very capable judges, prosecutors who are American, very capable prosecutors.</sentence><sentence id="264">I think very excellent prosecutors.</sentence><sentence id="265">Almost all personnel with the exception of those employed to do the translating and interpreting were of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">So, I felt that it was a fiction.</sentence><sentence id="267">We had voted this idea down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">I was on a committee to determine whether we would hold what was called "subsequent proceedings under American authority" but to be called international.</sentence><sentence id="269">Well, aside from that, the trials were very similar.</sentence><sentence id="270">The Tokyo trial was much like the Nuremberg trial, but the language was a barrier to public comprehension.</sentence><sentence id="271">The faces were different.</sentence><sentence id="272">The Japanese were not as easily depicted to the American imagination and mind as were the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="273">The German Bund was something that we could comprehend in their swashbuckling style, but the Japanese methods were very foreign to us.</sentence><sentence id="274">So, their infiltrative process -- as a matter of fact we misunderstood them to such an extent, that a lot of the Japanese U.S. citizens were thrown in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, as you know, when Pearl Harbor came about.</sentence><sentence id="275">I think today that wouldn't happen because we understand the <span class="REGION">Orientals</span> better than we did then.</sentence><sentence id="276">I don't know what we would have done with the German American Bund.</sentence><sentence id="277">It seems to me that a lot of those fellows probably should have gone to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> that didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="278">Do you understand what I'm saying here?</sentence><sentence id="279">Well, the strata I started to get at, that would be with MacArthur seemingly at the top as the Appellate Authority.</sentence><sentence id="280">It shouldn't have been that way.</sentence><sentence id="281">The Appellate authority really should have been the President of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I suppose ultimately it was, but MacArthur's been presented historically as the top authority.</sentence><sentence id="282">And Keenan as the chief prosecutor, the justices were working under the leadership of Sir William Webb of <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, who was the Chief Justice of the Tribunal.</sentence><sentence id="283">The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, just for the purposes of identifying the Americans, the U.S. representative was a fellow by the name of John P.Higgins.</sentence><sentence id="284">John Patrick Higgins, who had been the Chief Justice of the Superior Court system in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span>, very bitterly opposed by Keenan.</sentence><sentence id="285">Keenan didn't want him on the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">Unfortunately Higgins found that out, because when he was appointed, he had served in the Congress at one time with President Truman when Truman was a Congressman.</sentence><sentence id="287">The result of that was that they had an affection for each other and Truman appointed him after having asked Keenan what he thought of him, over Telecon, which is a very slow process of communication.</sentence><sentence id="288">I guess he figured that when you asked someone, when the President asked you're going to say, "Oh, yes, Mr. President we like him."</sentence><sentence id="289">But Keenan had sent a scathing kind of a commentary back over Telecon which the fate had been accomplished at that point.</sentence><sentence id="290">Higgins had been named.</sentence><sentence id="291">He had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, was able to read all the exchange of communications including that which was distressing to him.</sentence><sentence id="292">He possibly if he had been a different person might have quit on the spot, but he didn't want to put anybody in a position of embarrassment.</sentence><sentence id="293">So, he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">I talked to him many times, and he was an awfully nice gentleman.</sentence><sentence id="295">A very fine justice.</sentence><sentence id="296">The Chief Justice was extremely fond of him and they came to look upon each other as being equal in their comprehension of the law.</sentence><sentence id="297">But Higgins waited until an appropriate time and then he threw a bomb into the works by quitting.</sentence><sentence id="298">He didn't quit in a manner that should have embarrassed anyone, but he just said, that there had been many deaths on the <span class="BUILDING">Courts</span> in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> and I have to go back and take care of things, take charge.</sentence><sentence id="299">So, he left.</sentence><sentence id="300">That had the effect of sort

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="406">A: Yes, the Department of Justice, I think, primarily had sent lawyers over at the request of MacArthur, I presume.</sentence><sentence id="407">Every one of the accused, there were 28, had an American counsel.</sentence><sentence id="408">In addition to which, they also had Japanese counsel.</sentence><sentence id="409">Tojo refused American counsel.</sentence><sentence id="410">He didn't want American counsel, and to my thought, perhaps the most intelligent lawyer, the best scholar in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> was probably Tojo's lawyer, Dr.Kiosi (ph).</sentence><sentence id="411">I have very high regard for him and his capacity.</sentence><sentence id="412">As a matter of fact, I have very high regard for the ability of Tojo himself.</sentence><sentence id="413">When you're dealing with people like that you can't just water them off as being enemies.</sentence><sentence id="414">There is something very special about a man who's able to become the Prime Minister of his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="415">Tojo was known as old razor brains, and I can see why.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="429">A: Yes, but the system we used in the interrogation of Tojo one man on our staff was promised the sole and exclusive right to the cross examination of Tojo.</sentence><sentence id="430">In other words, Tojo was going to be his accused.</sentence><sentence id="431">I was assigned two people.</sentence><sentence id="432">General Hiroki, who had been sort of the tutor and sort of a well guiding force and godfather behind Hirohito as he was growing up, up through his years and until he became the Prince Regent, took over for his father in about 1928 or 1929.</sentence><sentence id="433">General Hiroki was the oldest accused in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">She probably had more influence on what happened in later years than anyone else there.</sentence><sentence id="435">Hiroki and the other was Hiroto.</sentence><sentence id="436">Hiroto was a diplomat and had been a foreign minister.</sentence><sentence id="437">These were my two for preparation for ultimate cross examination, which I never did conduct because I came here and then later went to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="438">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because of emergencies and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> after I had gotten the emergency somewhat in hand, but I had to keep working until I thought everything was right with my family again.</sentence><sentence id="439">Came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- I had resigned to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> thinking I was through.</sentence><sentence id="440">When I got back, I found that I wasn't able to really get away.</sentence><sentence id="441">My <span class="BUILDING">law practice</span> had dribbled out.</sentence><sentence id="442">Other lawyers had ruminants of it.</sentence><sentence id="443">I had been gone almost a year, and I needed a job very badly and one had been offered in the European trials, so I accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="444">But I sort of lost the trend of my thought there for a second with regard to the --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="461">Q: What was it like to meet Tojo?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="463">A: Tojo was what we were talking about a moment ago.</sentence><sentence id="464">It seems to me, or I was talking about, Jack Feeley, who had been I think the Solicitor General, he was either an assistant Solicitor General of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or the Solicitor General, also head of, if I remember correctly, of the Justice Department at one time, Criminal Division of the Justice Department at one time, had been promised by Keenan that he would be the sole and exclusive counsel to cross examine and prepare the case against Tojo, and this of course was more or less a center piece of the trial once the Emperor was out of the picture.</sentence><sentence id="465">So, that was Feeley's role.</sentence><sentence id="466">A very interesting fact that that promise was given to him all the way from the very beginning which lends itself to whether or not there was some question about whether the Emperor would be tried.</sentence><sentence id="467">You see, we didn't know it until down the <span class="DLF">line</span> some weeks later whether or not the Emperor was actually going to be tried or not.</sentence><sentence id="468">But I think Keenan had a pretty good idea because he was promising the chief individual in the trial, or what seemed to be the chief individual in the trial, Tojo, to this one man.</sentence><sentence id="469">It seems to suggest that back as early as our departure date which was the 2nd of December 1945, that there was some knowledge, but we did have a message delivered to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> just before departure.</sentence><sentence id="470">It came from the President.</sentence><sentence id="471">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Presidential car</span> came with this seemingly secret message to Keenan, and we knew it had to do with the Emperor because we were told after that that we would not be permitted to interrogate anyone in the <span class="BUILDING">Royal household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="472">That seemed to suggest many things that were happening in retrospect.</sentence><sentence id="473">It suggests also that the Emperor might not be tried, probably wouldn't be tried.</sentence><sentence id="474">Whether that had been a decision made, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="475">We do know that the people who are foremost in making that decision aside from the President himself, on the <span class="REGION">United States side</span>, were John McCloy who was the --well he was really running the War Department under Stimson in that time period, and MacArthur of course had a voice in it as did Joseph Grew who had been our Ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="476">All of these were opposed to the trial of the Emperor.</sentence><sentence id="477">Now, the Soviets wanted him tried.</sentence><sentence id="478">So did the British, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="479">There were various people who wanted the Emperor tried.</sentence><sentence id="480">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had the most to lose in that situation, if you can believe that by trying the Emperor that the Japanese would have fought to the last inch.</sentence><sentence id="481">It was thought that the assault on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Honshu</span>!</sentence><sentence id="482">which was being planned, might have cost millions of lives, American lives, and more millions of Japanese lives so that it would have been a wise practical decision to say, well, all it's going to take to have peace is you can have your Emperor.</sentence><sentence id="483">It was easy to lay the blame on the military.</sentence><sentence id="484">The Emperor, the assistant in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, the Emperor would have of course be following to a large extent, he was not quite the mouth piece that some people might have described to him for the military just saying yes.</sentence><sentence id="485">When I say the mouthpiece, I mean the yes-man.</sentence><sentence id="486">He had more voice than that, but he seemed to go along pretty well with what was wanted in those days.</sentence><sentence id="487">The Navy was opposed, for example, to the attack on Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="488">The Army was pushing for it.</sentence><sentence id="489">The Navy had to carry it out, of course and did it with dispatch.</sentence><sentence id="490">But they had fought against the concept.</sentence><sentence id="491">A number of the Navy people felt that it was a losing war if we did that.</sentence><sentence id="492">It appears that they were right.</sentence><sentence id="493">Going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tojo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="494">So, Feeley had total authority as to whether or not one would get to talk with Tojo at Sogolmo (ph) Prison.</sentence><sentence id="495">When I wanted to talk to Tojo, I had to do it through Feeley.</sentence><sentence id="496">Generally, if I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">Sogolmo Prison</span> with him, I could, but I was not permitted to speak, nor were any other lawyers to speak personally with Tojo, except off the record.</sentence><sentence id="497">Off the record we might have a few comments, but on the record, that which was to become part of his official affidavit sworn testimony, my name would not appear in it.</sentence><sentence id="498">Although there would be questions in it which I had propounded through Feeley which I would use in turn in my phase of the trial about censorship, propaganda, police controls and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="499">I recall one incident sort of in passing concerning the fact of his being called "Old Razor Brains" while we were there one very cold day in December or January, that winter of "45-"46, a couple of plumbers came into this little <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Sogolmo Prison</span> and those of us who were there were the interpreter was a Commander Maxim has written a book about his experiences.</sentence><sentence id="500">He was the interpreter, Jeff, he was an American Commander, a Navy man.</sentence><sentence id="501">Myrtle Mills was Feeley's own secretary who was taking notes.</sentence><sentence id="502">Feeley himself with me, and of course Tojo.</sentence><sentence id="503">Two fellows " The largest of the <span class="REGION">Japanese islands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="504">came in, two Japanese workmen began to pound on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiators</span>, it was terribly cold, with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wrenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="505">And the girl said "Hubba, Hubba" so they got up and went out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">That was being interpreted as very slang, so Tojo said something in Japanese to Maxim, the interpreter and they both began to laugh.</sentence><sentence id="507">They hubba-hubba back and forth a little bit, an then it was explained to us that Tojo said that every night when he left that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the guards would poke him in the back with their billy clubs and say hubba hubba and up until now he had always believed that meant remember Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="508">He knew it would get a laugh out of us.</sentence><sentence id="509">I'm sure he didn't really mean that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">And I would review these, all the evidence that had been gathered on them.</sentence><sentence id="745">I had my own opinions about whether they should be tried or not and then I would pass them along with a suggestion that they be tried or they not be tried or that they be reviewed by someone else so that it was sort of part of a chain link proposition, a <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> before they got to trial.</sentence><sentence id="746">In many cases, I'd put a case aside because I wanted to try it myself for one reason or because others didn't want to try it.</sentence><sentence id="747">If 1 wanted to try it and felt that it should be tried, I'd try it.</sentence><sentence id="748">I'm not sure how many lawyers may have been doing that.</sentence><sentence id="749">I was known as a chief trial attorney.</sentence><sentence id="750">That was my title.</sentence><sentence id="751">I worked under well really three other lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="752">One the head of the War Crimes Detachment which we normally call the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> contingent was a fellow by the name of Straight, Brigadier General Straight.</sentence><sentence id="753">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">Under him was a Colonel Howard Brissey.</sentence><sentence id="755">Brissey was the head of the Dachau detachment, where the trials actually were held, but the chief of the trial branch who was really my immediate overseer and boss was Leo Goodman.</sentence><sentence id="756">Leo had been an Army Colonel I think and before he died he had become -- two principle jobs he held.</sentence><sentence id="757">One was head of the American Chamber of Commerce in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but before that he was Counsel General, I believe, he went into diplomatic service.</sentence><sentence id="758">Well, Leo was the one I had to report to most directly and we had day to day contact.</sentence><sentence id="759">The others were looking at him and he was looking at them, but this was my chain of command.</sentence><sentence id="760">He was very competent, a very competent lawyer and a very nice man to work with and for.</sentence><sentence id="761">We were very good personal friends.</sentence><sentence id="762">I enjoyed that experience, I guess more because of him than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="763">It would have been very lonesome.</sentence><sentence id="764">He was a bachelor and he later married in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">He was a man of great high moral values and if it hadn't been for him I don't think I could have stood the thing away from family and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="766">So, anyhow, he wanted me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> as we were closing down the <span class="BUILDING">trial branch</span> and I said, "Gee I don't think it's my thing.</sentence><sentence id="767">I've had this thing offered to me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>."</sentence><sentence id="768">And he said, "Well, what if I won't approve of it?"</sentence><sentence id="769">I said, "Well, I think you certainly have that option.</sentence><sentence id="770">Out of all the things you've done for me I could hardly be angry about it but I would still say no."</sentence><sentence id="771">Well, you have to pay your own way back you know.</sentence><sentence id="772">Well, I'd be willing to do that.</sentence><sentence id="773">My wife was probably well enough for me to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and take over things without the 3 worry.</sentence><sentence id="774">He said, "Oh well, go ahead and take the job."</sentence><sentence id="775">It meant a promotion, so I was glad to do that.</sentence><sentence id="776">I was then on Lucius Clay's staff, legal staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> during the <span class="DLF">blockade</span> in a position known as General Counsel on High Priority Policy Matters.</sentence><sentence id="777">It really meant dealing with the Soviets as much as anything.</sentence><sentence id="778">That's about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="834">Q: What did that job entail?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="836">A: Somebody from the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> told me that they had read some of the opinions that I had written and were complimenting the fact that I had given the Italians back all of their artwork, that gives you an idea, the restitution of property.</sentence><sentence id="837">Just many <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="838">It really meant that I was doing a policy job of involving international matters that had to be adjudicated based as best we could on what law we had to work with and claims of other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="839">We worked on the currency reform matter, for example, which resulted in a break with the Soviets as you know.</sentence><sentence id="840">I guess somebody might know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="846">Q: How did you get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> on the first or second of January of 1947 and as soon as I reported I was put to work.</sentence><sentence id="849">I wasn't given a chance to do much except take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and start looking at cases.</sentence><sentence id="850">The first thing that I was doing was interrogating various people who had already been interrogated by investigators, trying to decide whether or not the testimony would stand up.</sentence><sentence id="851">Looking at the record of what evidence was there to try cases, and I started trying cases myself first with some of the other lawyers who had been there awhile and then later as the Chief Counsel in whatever trials I was taking on.</sentence><sentence id="852">Really, in an administrative matter am I getting there.</sentence><sentence id="853">I would like to have stayed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> except for one thing, and that was the subsequent proceedings ran contrary to two things.</sentence><sentence id="854">One my own personal belief in calling something international that has really become unilateral as they had.</sentence><sentence id="855">It had the color internationalism because it was all being done on international law to some extent.</sentence><sentence id="856">But it was not international law as far as personnel was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="857">I felt that if maybe the French of the British would have stayed there or the Soviets that they -- it was only bilateral.</sentence><sentence id="858">You could still call it international and it would stick, but when all but the Americans had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the American Judges and the American prosecutors or the people who had to deal with it you have to appeal to only one source from then on and that's the Supreme Court of the United States, and that becomes an American Trial as far as I am concerned.</sentence><sentence id="859">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> held me wrong in that.</sentence><sentence id="860">One of the trials-- I have to say very quickly that those cases at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> were very well tried, excellently tried.</sentence><sentence id="861">And I think all the lawyers, all the Judges that I knew were splendid.</sentence><sentence id="862">They did their job very well, so I wouldn't fault that.</sentence><sentence id="863">I just had this strong feeling against calling something what it isn't.</sentence><sentence id="864">But the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> held against my thinking in the Frederick Flick case.</sentence><sentence id="865">And I knew Flick.</sentence><sentence id="866">Flick had asked me to defend him at a later time.</sentence><sentence id="867">What he actually asked, after he had been imprisoned, he had a relatively shortened prisonment and was at <span class="BUILDING">Lansburg prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">I had a request while I was still trying cases at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, I had gotten quite a bit of publicity in the German press as a result of that Lottenbaucher(ph) case.</sentence><sentence id="869">I think that gave the 4 wrong impression to the Germans, that maybe I was sympathetic with the Germans, which I was not, with the Nazis, which I certainly was not.</sentence><sentence id="870">But after all, he was one of the top people in the German government, and head of the Hitler youth, and he was acquitted.</sentence><sentence id="871">So a lot of these Germans thought perhaps that they needed my services.</sentence><sentence id="872">Baroness Von , | think she was a Baroness, she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and asked me if I would go she said her husband had requested that I come down and see him at <span class="BUILDING">Landsberg prison</span>, that he had been convicted by a <span class="BUILDING">war crimes court</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and this really piqued my curiosity because I was doing some writing anyhow about the various <span class="BUILDING">war crimes court</span>, and I wanted to find out more about that, to that extent I wanted to talk with him.</sentence><sentence id="873">I did go down.</sentence><sentence id="874">He had been a diplomat in the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beijing</span> (ph.)</sentence><sentence id="875">He had been tried by a <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, which I thought had died really about World War I days, but apparently he had been tried by <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="876">Apparently that didn't cause the State Department any kind of turn.</sentence><sentence id="877">They normally, I think, might have said, well we have no business doing that and turned it over to the Army, but he was convicted and somehow ended up in <span class="BUILDING">Lansburg Prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="878">But what he wanted to see me about was the fact that he was a friend of Frederick Flick.</sentence><sentence id="879">Now Flick was running the .</sentence><sentence id="880">Flick was really big league and what Puttcomer said to me is that Mr.Flick who was present during this conversation that we were conversing in English primarily although by that time I did speak a workman like kind of German, but we were talking in English and Puttcomer said that "Flick says if he is released from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that he has the plan for rebuilding <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the cuff of his sleeve."</sentence><sentence id="881">Interesting commentary.</sentence><sentence id="882">Well, apparently he did.</sentence><sentence id="883">Because as you know when he was realised--So, he wanted to know if I would take the case.</sentence><sentence id="884">I said, "You know, I have a problem.</sentence><sentence id="885">I'm an insider and I'm not sure that I can get released to do it, but if I can, can we talk money."</sentence><sentence id="886">He said, "Well would you talk with my board at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="887">Apparently it was what was the makings of the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Farbinworth</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="888">So, I did.</sentence><sentence id="889">I talked with them, and we agreed that if I could, my job in this case would be to make an appeal on this case to see if I could at least get clemency and get him out on the grounds that he really could do something about the rebuilding of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">And the whole thrust at that point of our new policy with Marshall Plan and so on coming in was to do just exactly that to try to rebuild <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="891">So, it seemed like an interesting concept.</sentence><sentence id="892">I wasn't at all sympathetic with the slave labor thing.</sentence><sentence id="893">As you know, I had tried a number of people because I felt that slave labor was something that people shouldn't prosper from.</sentence><sentence id="894">And I tried persons who had been kind to slave labor, thinking of the Schindler movie, for example, turning that over in my head.</sentence><sentence id="895">Probably had his case come across my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, I would personally have tried him, because I think he shouldn't have escaped simply because he was willing to try to help some people.</sentence><sentence id="896">He wasn't such a great person himself.</sentence><sentence id="897">You know, if you want to be just about it, he was probably not any different than some of the others.</sentence><sentence id="898">I did try one, a couple of brothers, not brothers, a couple of relatives I think they were the Wuelfert Meat Packing.</sentence><sentence id="899">I was wandering a little bit here.</sentence><sentence id="900">5 Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="956">Q: Robert, I'd like you to give us a sense of the process.</sentence><sentence id="957">How did they choose perpetrators?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="960">How did they get them?</sentence><sentence id="961">How did you decide the cases?</sentence><sentence id="962">What kind of cases came across your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>?</sentence><sentence id="963">Can you give us a sense of what the process was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="964">A: I think I can give a sense of the choice both in Europe and in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and there was a little variation and it probably has to do with employment of personnel as well.</sentence><sentence id="965">The personnel employment started at the very top level, as I indicated.</sentence><sentence id="966">The Attorney General, then Keenan and eventually both at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> the authority passed to the War Department, who were engaging different persons for jobs here and there.</sentence><sentence id="967">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> insofar as the accused were concerned, we started with several lists.</sentence><sentence id="968">The State Department the Foreign Service had lists of persons who were likely suspects.</sentence><sentence id="969">So did the military.</sentence><sentence id="970">So did the various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who came in and we took these and we were able to find the common denominator amongst all of them.</sentence><sentence id="971">They all presumably had Tojo on them, for example.</sentence><sentence id="972">I don't want to say the Emperor.</sentence><sentence id="973">I can't recall that any of the U.S. lists had the Emperor on specifically.</sentence><sentence id="974">Some of the foreign lists did.</sentence><sentence id="975">In Europe the personnel thing worked pretty much the same way, and so did the choice of the original persons.</sentence><sentence id="976">We had four <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> that were looking at lists in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">Arriving at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, the people who you had lists of names -- first of all, you knew immediately who was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when you took over.</sentence><sentence id="978">General Jacob Devors, who I think was Eisenhower's operations officer on the invasion, I was on a lecture tour with him, oh a number of years after the trials, but he told me that one of his units had overrun <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and he had gone in there.</sentence><sentence id="979">Well, they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw the conditions of the inmates.</sentence><sentence id="980">In his case, just as a matter of some interest, I got back into the subject of witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="981">There are two categories.</sentence><sentence id="982">There was the German people who lived around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> as well as those that were inmates.</sentence><sentence id="983">He was so outraged by what he found there that he had his troops round up everybody that they could find in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and bring them out there to see what was there.</sentence><sentence id="984">He said from the looks on the faces of the German people, of the residents of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, he was inclined to believe that they did not really know.</sentence><sentence id="985">Well, it was one of those things, speak no evil, hear no evil, you don't see no evil.</sentence><sentence id="986">I think that's perhaps it more than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="987">They knew, but they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="988">They chose not to know, because you couldn't not really know.</sentence><sentence id="989">In any case, he believed that they were ignorant of the facts.</sentence><sentence id="990">Now, you have all these terrible things that you find there.</sentence><sentence id="991">Stacks of bodies, emaciated persons, people who are hardly able to -- you get a lot of names.</sentence><sentence id="992">These are people who are going to be used possibly as witnesses at what took place.</sentence><sentence id="993">No matter <span class="NPIP">where</span> they went, they eventually got some requests to come back and testify.</sentence><sentence id="994">Those who were surviving.</sentence><sentence id="995">And they were given an opportunity, those who came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="996">Now, this was not just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, of course it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, you name them, all of the camps.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1030">Q: You mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> trials included more than --?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1032">A: From our perspective they did.</sentence><sentence id="1033">They included all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1034">They 6 included all of the atrocities which were committed against U.S. citizens.</sentence><sentence id="1035">We had something known as "fire cases."</sentence><sentence id="1036">These were our airmen who were brutally murdered when they were shot down.</sentence><sentence id="1037">There were various categories of trials that were tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">But the true primary kinds were one that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> atrocity cases and those which were the special cases which involved not just camp personnel but a lot of the people on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Gestapo, the SS the SA, the Police organization, the paramilitary organizations who had committed atrocities against various allied prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1039">Well, all those involving American citizens were tried there.</sentence><sentence id="1040">All of the cases that were committed against inmates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> within what we call the American Zone of Occupation, whether it be <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or whether it be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, were tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1041">That was the site of all the war crimes trials, other than the very few cases tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1042">See, only a total of 13 cases were tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1043">One of those was the original four power international trial involving Rudolf Hess and the others.</sentence><sentence id="1044">The other 12 cases were what we called subsequent proceedings.</sentence><sentence id="1045">Excellent cases for trial.</sentence><sentence id="1046">They had to be tried no matter how they were tried they had to be tried.</sentence><sentence id="1047">There was no question about that.</sentence><sentence id="1048">My only difference was to call them international or not international but either way they were well tried.</sentence><sentence id="1049">So, those 13 cases were the only cases tried by American authority in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1050">The only other cases that were tried by American authority or personnel were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1051">All of the cases involving atrocities committed in our zones of occupation, our zone of control.</sentence><sentence id="1052">We brought them all there to try them.</sentence><sentence id="1053">And frequently we'd get someone from another zone.</sentence><sentence id="1054">If I knew a name that was on a list in the Soviet Union who was not particularly wanted by them in the Soviet zone of occupation or the British or the French, then I could put in a request through our channels and ask for that person to be sent to us so that we would either try him or use him as a witness, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1055">The routine that was followed primarilly--So I have established now how we gained witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="1056">These were primarily the inmates or the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, depending on the category of the trial.</sentence><sentence id="1057">Then we have a line up procedure, much like a <span class="DLF">police line</span> up in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in which the inmates who are assigned to a particular category of geographical category say at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1058">They were camp personnel.</sentence><sentence id="1059">They were guards.</sentence><sentence id="1060">They were administrative personnel, whatever they were.</sentence><sentence id="1061">They are now in a prison uniform of some sort and they're marched across a <span class="DLF">stage</span> with a number around their heads.</sentence><sentence id="1062">Sitting out in the audience are people who have been in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1063">This may involve several lineups, because people who come from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> may not be there at the same time, so you might have a similar lineup on the same people at different times before you conclude what you're going to do about the individuals that are wearing that number.</sentence><sentence id="1064">So, with a piece of paper which has certain questions on it, kind of a questionnaire which will carry the name as put in my the prospective witness, the former inmate.</sentence><sentence id="1065">He writes his name and the data about himself, where he can be reached and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1066">Question one, do you recognize any one on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1067">If he answers yes, then he's going to have to go on from there.</sentence><sentence id="1068">It it's no, then obviously he's not concerned with that lineup any further.</sentence><sentence id="1069">If he answers yes, please identify him.</sentence><sentence id="1070">It's so and so and so, number 3, number 17, number 19.</sentence><sentence id="1071">Where did you know them?</sentence><sentence id="1072">I knew them at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dachau</span> at such and such detail, maybe it's the medical detail or the slop detail or the concentration -- I 7 don't remember, what did they call it -- the Brause, the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, really, detail.</sentence><sentence id="1073">And they've indicated where within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they knew him.</sentence><sentence id="1074">Now they're asked what the specific name is.</sentence><sentence id="1075">They identify a name.</sentence><sentence id="1076">Now, obviously the next step that an investigator who's looked at this paper, if he finds any error in it, he knows that error has to be corrected or this is not going to be a good witness.</sentence><sentence id="1077">What did this individual do?</sentence><sentence id="1078">For example, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> case there were a lot of important elements of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> case that were going to effect the whole history of the trials.</sentence><sentence id="1079">One of them was the fact that Ilse Koch, the wife of the camp commandant had chosen individuals apparently for extermination based on the fact that she wanted to have a lampshade or bookcover out of a tattoo that the individual had.</sentence><sentence id="1080">How to prove it?</sentence><sentence id="1081">The positive evidence against her included on one case that she straddled a <span class="DLF">trench</span> where some prisoners were working and she urinated on them.</sentence><sentence id="1082">When you consider the health conditions of those prisoners it could have been something that caused their death ultimately, and that she had hit one or some of them with a riding crop.</sentence><sentence id="1083">That could cause the death of a very emaciated person, because they weren't getting much to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Actually they were getting virtually nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1085">So, that she could have caused the death of these people.</sentence><sentence id="1086">It doesn't mean that she did, because there was no proof that she did, but that she hit them is uncontroverted.</sentence><sentence id="1087">That she's there, that she's part of the system that is part of a conspiracy she could be tried on the common design element of it.</sentence><sentence id="1088">All of these were provable cases against Ilse Koch.</sentence><sentence id="1089">Now, you get to the more serious charge of choosing someone for extermination so that she can have -- in other words we have a murder case against her.</sentence><sentence id="1090">In any case, you got a murder case against her.</sentence><sentence id="1091">You can say that under the common design "X" number of people are exterminated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dachau</span> and she's a part of the administration which caused that death.</sentence><sentence id="1092">In my case, I would ask for a death penalty for her if I had tried her on those <span class="DLF">grounds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1093">But when you choose a <span class="DLF">path</span> to try to pressure in on the fact that the big crime that she committed is the lampshades the question is are you going to be able to prove your case and to prove it -- so some of these people who were in the lineup and saw her with a number now have said on their questionnaire her name is Ilse Koch.</sentence><sentence id="1094">She was a camp commander's wife.</sentence><sentence id="1095">She has done these things that I know of at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1096">So, Bill Denson and Bob Kunzo who are the trial counsel, very competent trial counsel in that particular case, had to take the evidence as presented to them by the investigators who were going over what had happened in the lineup procedure and who were sort of trying to farm out what was good and bad evidence were going to find when they went to trial that two things would happen.</sentence><sentence id="1097">One there had been a leak on the publicity on what we call raw materials.</sentence><sentence id="1098">What does the witness really know?The witness said they knew that Ilse Koch had chosen these particular individuals for extermination for lampshade tattoos and bookcovers are now in evidence.</sentence><sentence id="1099">So, what were the names of the prisoners who were exterminated.</sentence><sentence id="1100">Then you get down to the fine points of cross examination and they had some pretty good trial counsel, I take it.</sentence><sentence id="1101">And they were unable to properly identify who it was.</sentence><sentence id="1102">Joe, I don't know his last name, I don't know his number.</sentence><sentence id="1103">Where did Joe go?</sentence><sentence id="1104">Well, the last time I saw him he was headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1105">I don't know where he died.</sentence><sentence id="1106">So you have a hard time identifying.</sentence><sentence id="1107">I do know that I recognize that tattoo.</sentence><sentence id="1108">I recognize that lampshade as having been his tattoo.</sentence><sentence id="1109">But it's a loose kind of thing that troubles the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, because they look at this evidence as being not quite 8 tied up.</sentence><sentence id="1110">There were some death penalties in that case.</sentence><sentence id="1111">Bill Denson if he's interrogated will be able to tell you who was and who wasn't executed as a result of his good prosecutor work.</sentence><sentence id="1112">She got a relatively light sentence.</sentence><sentence id="1113">I think like 13 or 14 years.</sentence><sentence id="1114">I was on Clay's staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> when her case came up for review there and Clay cut it way back.</sentence><sentence id="1115">And then she was turned over to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1116">Clay was criticized for this.</sentence><sentence id="1117">The lawyer who did the review was a very conscientious lawyer named Dick Higgins, Brigadier Major General, in fact, if he's still living, a reservist in the air corp.</sentence><sentence id="1118">Dick Higgin was on our staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> both in the trial branch and later in -- by the way he'd be a good person to interview if he's still living here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Later he was on the review staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> when I refused to go there, he went over.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Later he joined our staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> doing much of the same thing I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> except that he had the job of looking at all of the records of those that Clay wanted to go over to see whether or not on the petitions that were being presented to him they should have commutation of sentence or maybe even a pardon.</sentence><sentence id="1121">In the case of Ilse Koch, Higgin said he couldn't find adequate, essentially I'm putting words in his mouth.</sentence><sentence id="1122">He may be living and deny this, but whatever he said to Clay he thought the sentence should be commuted to a lesser one because the evidence wasn't adequate.</sentence><sentence id="1123">That essentially is what it added up to.</sentence><sentence id="1124">So, Clay commuted the sentence and she was turned over to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1125">I don't know what happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="1126">I understand she got a little stiffer sentence in the <span class="BUILDING">German courts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1127">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="1128">She was a bad one.</sentence><sentence id="1129">But again, the evidence was weak there.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And I myself tried some of those lampshade and bookcover sort of cases, the tattoo things.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And it's awfully hard to make a case there.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I tried, myself I used to try bear down on what I thought was the more cogent part of the charges.</sentence><sentence id="1133">If an individual is present in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as an integral part of the machinery that was putting hundreds of thousands of people to death, in that particular complex or even thousands, you had a good murder charge against them.</sentence><sentence id="1134">What difference does it make about <span class="BUILDING">lampshades</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1135">So, you could throw that in in passing, but don't bear down on that so that the defense leaps on it and says it has a lot of weak spots in it and they make a little impression on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> could not deny the fact that an individual who's in there pointing a billy club or a gun or a club at somebody and sending them down here and another step and another step and the next step the fellow's emaciated and he's being dragged by the heels down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and they take down the data and he's given a towel and a piece of soap and locked into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1137">Everybody in that <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> is guilty.</sentence><sentence id="1138">You can't get around that fact, and that's the way I approached all of my cases.</sentence><sentence id="1139">A lot of people got thrown off on what I call the glamour side of the trial.</sentence><sentence id="1140">It looked better to talk about some of these specific things.</sentence><sentence id="1141">For example some of them you could make a case more easily in the medical cases, the experimental cases.</sentence><sentence id="1142">They had some crazy kinds of things that were done in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1143">It's painful to me to think of these things, but anyhow, I recall there was one little sort of an operation type room was set up in the <span class="BUILDING">camp hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1144">They could hose it down after they blew a few brains out there.</sentence><sentence id="1145">They'd bring people in as if they were going to take photographs of them.</sentence><sentence id="1146">Set them all up as if they were going to take their photograph, and then somebody behind them would just blow their brains out.</sentence><sentence id="1147">You know, neither rhyme nor reason.</sentence><sentence id="1148">Maybe the person was a trouble maker in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1149">But there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to that kind of murder.</sentence><sentence id="1150">And they had experiments such as trying to freeze people 9 to see whether or not they could recover by putting a couple of warm bodies.</sentence><sentence id="1151">They would take individuals and bring them down to the temperature of the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span>, for example, presumably the thought was that some of the German airman or seaman who were thrown into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> one way or another there could survive if they were given a certain kind of treatment afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1152">So, they put a couple of girls in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with this body after this person after he reached a certain temperature or had been exposed to cold water for a certain period of time to see whether that would revive him.</sentence><sentence id="1153">Whether human body heat would revive him.</sentence><sentence id="1154">Any kind of experiment would seem to go.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And of course they had other kinds of experiments with medications and injections and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1156">Mostly the damage was done by virtually working them to death.</sentence><sentence id="1157">They reached a certain point of <span class="BUILDING">infirmity</span> or they came in and they were of no use to the work program.</sentence><sentence id="1158">When I think about it, my God why didn't -- if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted to use these people for the work program, or the sustenance, why didn't they feed them well.</sentence><sentence id="1159">Why didn't they treat them well.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Why not use them as free labor but try to save them.</sentence><sentence id="1161">Why kill off your free labor.</sentence><sentence id="1162">That's a good thing to get rid of.</sentence><sentence id="1163">It made no sense really.</sentence><sentence id="1164">The SS were terrible people.</sentence><sentence id="1165">They were terrible people.</sentence><sentence id="1166">And I doubt if Hitler was ever in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1167">I think these people at the top level tried to save themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1168">I wonder whether Imler was ever in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, Gering, people who were accountable for them.</sentence><sentence id="1169">I have no evidence that they ever were, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1170">The final solution?</sentence><sentence id="1171">Well, I doubt if they even looked at the refinements of the final solution.</sentence><sentence id="1172">The language probably just meant that somebody else is taking care of it.</sentence><sentence id="1173">Like superior orders, it's the law, everybody relying on the law.</sentence><sentence id="1174">That's why we had to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1175">It was always somebody up there that he did it, not me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1321">Q: Were you present at these <span class="DLF">lineups</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1322">Did you see that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1325">A: No, everything that reached me was after the <span class="DLF">lineups</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1326">I never -- they were still going on I'm sure, all the time, but no, I didn't bother with lineups.</sentence><sentence id="1327">First of all I was trying to look at the material that came out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> up in a professional way.</sentence><sentence id="1328">As to whether or not a case could be made.</sentence><sentence id="1329">If there were weaknesses I would write a little memo as to what I thought were the weaknesses in it and pass it to someone else.</sentence><sentence id="1330">They were either able to strengthen it with further evidence or maybe they wanted to try it that way they could.</sentence><sentence id="1331">I wouldn't try a case that I didn't think was prepared enough for trial.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1339">Q: Can you give us an example?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1341">A: Well, the ones that I just talked about would be good examples.</sentence><sentence id="1342">If a case came up -- no, really there's a couple of cases I defended simply because I realized they were not defensible and it was partly because I had a feeling with regard to the other counsel.</sentence><sentence id="1343">This doesn't make me look very good, but my friend Jim Phelps, with whom I really practiced law for a while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1344">Jim was part Indian.</sentence><sentence id="1345">I understood from people that knew him very well that he was Audi Murphy's C.O. That he was a captain, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1346">The time we knew him, he had just been discharged.</sentence><sentence id="1347">He was a captain.</sentence><sentence id="1348">He had apparently been a first lieutenant when he commanded troops at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anzio</span>, or the Italian campaign, and Audi Murphy with all those medals, the most decorated soldier had to go either forward to the 0 Germans of course, do all these magnificent heroic things that he did, or go back to Jim Phelps.</sentence><sentence id="1349">I've always said, knowing Phelps it was a lot hell of a lot safer to go forward to the Germans than to come back to Jim Phelps.</sentence><sentence id="1350">He was part Indian and he was mean, awfully mean.</sentence><sentence id="1351">But we were friends.</sentence><sentence id="1352">Anyhow, Jim had a case and he had gotten lazy.</sentence><sentence id="1353">He was an awfully good lawyer, and he had gotten lazy and there was one case that I had gotten familiar with.</sentence><sentence id="1354">I had looked at it and asked if I would take the defense on it.</sentence><sentence id="1355">Goodman was looking for someone to defend the case, and it looked like an open and shut case, as far as Phelps was concerned, and I guess as far as Goodman was concerned it seemed to be.</sentence><sentence id="1356">But I did a little investigation on it and decided I was criticized later for not telling the administration that it shouldn't be tried, but I did try it.</sentence><sentence id="1357">It was a farm lad who had apparently seen an airman descending, a U.S. airman descending, parachuted out of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1358">The police chief there had apparently knew there was something going on above.</sentence><sentence id="1359">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> shot down so he had acerned about where it was going to come down.</sentence><sentence id="1360">He got into his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, drove out to what was the <span class="REGION">area</span> and saw this farm lad standing there with a great big fence post in his hand, kind of like a tree limb.</sentence><sentence id="1361">And he was oddly turning his head from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="1362">The airman was dead on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> with his head all caved in.</sentence><sentence id="1363">And he said the ghost made me do it.</sentence><sentence id="1364">That was what he said and this was made a matter of the official record by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1365">So, the police chief took the lad back and took a statement from him.</sentence><sentence id="1366">Now, that's all the evidence that the government had.</sentence><sentence id="1367">Phelps presented the evidence, strutted around a little bit, try to top that one if you will and I said, "Chief have you known this accused?"</sentence><sentence id="1368">I knew in advance what was going to do it. "</sentence><sentence id="1369">Have you known this accused for a long period of time?"</sentence><sentence id="1370">He said, "I've known him all of his life." "</sentence><sentence id="1371">As a matter of fact, did you have any kind of fiduciary relationship with him, that is were you not his guardian?"</sentence><sentence id="1372">He said, "Yes, I had been his guardian." "</sentence><sentence id="1373">How did that happen?" "</sentence><sentence id="1374">His family was dead and he couldn't get into service.</sentence><sentence id="1375">He was kind of a dull kind of individual and he seemed to be kind of harmless."</sentence><sentence id="1376">I said, "Well this is not a harmless thing that's done here.</sentence><sentence id="1377">He's confessed to a crime here, has he not to murder?"</sentence><sentence id="1378">He said, "Yes, but he never committed a murder."</sentence><sentence id="1379">I said, "Well, why would you say that?"</sentence><sentence id="1380">He said, "Well, it wasn't unusual for him to confess to a crime.</sentence><sentence id="1381">He confessed to all the crimes that were ever committed in the community."</sentence><sentence id="1382">And I said, "did he commit any of those crimes?"</sentence><sentence id="1383">He said, "No, he never committed any of them.</sentence><sentence id="1384">He was really rather harmless sort of fellow."</sentence><sentence id="1385">I said, "Well this is not a harmless act, chief.</sentence><sentence id="1386">Let me ask you this.</sentence><sentence id="1387">Did you see that airman as he was descending."</sentence><sentence id="1388">He said, "Yes, I did." "</sentence><sentence id="1389">Would you tell the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> about what level his parachute opened?" "</sentence><sentence id="1390">Oh" he said, "it never opened.</sentence><sentence id="1391">He landed on his head."</sentence><sentence id="1392">Well, of course that blew the case out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, and the President of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> criticized both Phelps and me.</sentence><sentence id="1393">Phelps for not preparing the case better and me for not telling the administration which paid my salary.</sentence><sentence id="1394">That was mischievous.</sentence><sentence id="1395">Obviously that case should not have been tried and I shouldn't have done what I did, and Phelps should have done a better job, but other than that, and I tried that Lotterbaucher case.</sentence><sentence id="1396">I did that out of mischief as well, but I didn't like the lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="1397">I'm not proud of that, but that's what that was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1455">Q: Would you describe the Lotterbaucher case?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1459">A: Well, I was --tensions were very high.</sentence><sentence id="1460">We were trying to wrap up all this work at the end of the war crime.</sentence><sentence id="1461">We were told to close the program down by the first of January, I believe it was of 1948.</sentence><sentence id="1462">And so I had cases really stacked up along side my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>, and I was using my own tule of thumb.</sentence><sentence id="1463">If there were not 10,000 deaths asserted in the indictments that were going to be drafted to be attached to the case, I figured well, put it on the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="1464">Keep rotating it down so that those with the larger numbers could be referred to trial and recommend this is ready for trial, this one is ready trial, this one is not because the evidence is not sufficient and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1465">Obviously the ones with even one death that is provable is ready for trial.</sentence><sentence id="1466">So, some of them, because of the nature, the horror of the nature of the particular case could be referred to trial such as, well I suppose Phelps felt that one was horrible enough because of the manner of the killing of the American airman with a club over the <span class="DLF">fence post</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">I'm not sure whether that's a case that he referred to trial himself or somebody else had, anyhow he had it at trial.</sentence><sentence id="1468">He had options just as all of us had who were chief trial counsel.</sentence><sentence id="1469">He probably was doing much the same sort of thing as I was.</sentence><sentence id="1470">Here's a stack of cases.</sentence><sentence id="1471">On one occasion then while I'm in the midst of very serious work and I've got all my own problems I'm thinking about anyhow, one of the lawyers there was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, a major, a Bigelow Boison.</sentence><sentence id="1472">And Boison was sort of a mystery character in the war crimes program.</sentence><sentence id="1473">It was known that he had been there pretty much from he beginning.</sentence><sentence id="1474">He was working on one case.</sentence><sentence id="1475">He seemed to be single minded about it.</sentence><sentence id="1476">He didn't seem to want to work with anyone.</sentence><sentence id="1477">He didn't want to work on any other cases, and he was left pretty much to himself.</sentence><sentence id="1478">So, on this particular occasion, he was not a likeable individual.</sentence><sentence id="1479">He stuck his head in the <span class="DLF">door</span> of my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and he said, "Donihi, you're going to be my assistant in the Lotterbaucher case."</sentence><sentence id="1480">And I said, "Two questions: Who the hell is Lotterbaucher and who said so?"</sentence><sentence id="1481">After all, I knew I was a chief trial counsel.</sentence><sentence id="1482">I didn't know what he was.</sentence><sentence id="1483">I just knew he was a member -- I didn't even know whether he was even a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="1484">He was a member of the Judge Advocates General staff which I suppose qualified him in military law.</sentence><sentence id="1485">But I don't know whether he was a counsel lawyer or not.</sentence><sentence id="1486">And so he said, "Lottenbaucher is the person who was secretly selected to succeed Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="1487">That's who he is and Leo Goodman if you must know said."</sentence><sentence id="1488">Well Goodman was my boss and Leo was his boss, so I went down to see Leo and I said, "Why have you done this to me?"</sentence><sentence id="1489">And he said, "I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1490">He asked whether he could have you to assist him, and I said if it's all right with Donihi, it's all right with me."</sentence><sentence id="1491">I said, "In that case, would you please permit me to defend the case.</sentence><sentence id="1492">I don't like him" and I didn't know Lottenbaucher from Johan Schmidt at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1493">As I got into the Lotterbaucher case I could see where Boison was sort of hanging himself rather than Lotterbaugher and I was really permitting him to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1494">And it offered an opportunity I could also see to properly dispute the evidence that he wanted to present about the selection of Lotterbaucher, I had to have some testimony from Nazis, high ranking Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1495">So as Lotterbaucher had worked as the Deputy Chief of the Hitler Youth under Alder Von Shurock who had been tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in the original case, Von Schirach was the head of the Hitler Youth, Von Schirach had then gone from that job to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> as the Gauleiter of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1496">Hitler chose individuals to head large <span class="REGION">political areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1497">He had gerrymandered <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into various <span class="BUILDING">Gaus</span>, states if you like, and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was considered to be a Gau, as was <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and so 2 forth, and each one of them had a gauwlighter placed in charge of them as they were put under German command.</sentence><sentence id="1498">So, in the case of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, this particular chap that was head of the Hitler Youth and gotten the job and as his deputy Lottenbaucher moved up into the number 2 position as the head of the Hitler Youth.</sentence><sentence id="1499">Now, Lotterbaucher then was chosen later and it had to be by a personal choice of Hitler, because he personally chose all the gaulighters, he was chosen to head the Gau of which was a large industrial, very important <span class="REGION">industrial area</span>, and he became also the president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1500">A very important job actually, and really I think any lawyer worth his salt would try Lottenbaucher with ease if he had properly tried the case would have gotten a death penalty.</sentence><sentence id="1501">Not that there's anything to be bragged about in getting a death penalty, but I think probably all these fellows deserved it.</sentence><sentence id="1502">Anyhow, now I'm going to be defending him and the weakness in the evidentiary link was whether or not we were going to be able to counter the evidence which is coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="1503">And Telford Taylor had written a letter, sort of a safe passage for one -- see if I can even think of his name.</sentence><sentence id="1504">He's written several books since then.</sentence><sentence id="1505">He was a very hard person to like ina <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1506">As a witness he would turn the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> against himself more than towards himself.</sentence><sentence id="1507">Under my cross examination he admitted, I wish I could think of his name right now, he admitted that he considered himself to be the father of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> and the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1508">Now, imagine the defense bringing in that kind of a character in this kind of a case to finger out Lotterbaucher who had a much lesser position.</sentence><sentence id="1509">This chap had married Goering's niece, according to his own testimony in order to save his own neck, he says.</sentence><sentence id="1510">Well, he's in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">Herman Goering factories</span>, a tremendous job using slave labor.</sentence><sentence id="1511">He was a bad one.</sentence><sentence id="1512">He should have been on trial.</sentence><sentence id="1513">But for some reason he had been granted immunity by Taylor probably because he was offering enough evidence against others.</sentence><sentence id="1514">And so now here he is offering evidence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and that was his primary testimony.</sentence><sentence id="1515">Well, of course, Rudolf Hess and who's the other one, I can't think of his name.</sentence><sentence id="1516">My memory fades a little bit at times.</sentence><sentence id="1517">They were the top ranking a higher rank in the seniority of things <span class="NPIP">within</span> in the German hierarchy than was this particular witness.</sentence><sentence id="1518">So, I felt that their testimony would be important.</sentence><sentence id="1519">I had no idea that I'd be able to get in, but I sent a message to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> asking permission to interrogate them and both of them had been convicted at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and were incarcerated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">It's a <span class="BUILDING">four power prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1521">In order to get there you'd have to get the permission of the Russians, the British, the French as well as the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1522">My avenues of approach had to be through the American mayor.</sentence><sentence id="1523">I'll call him mayor.</sentence><sentence id="1524">We had four military districts and the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was quartered with the British and the French and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and Russians, each in charge of one of those, we called them sectors.</sentence><sentence id="1525">But the four they were commanders of the American well not quite a concern, the <span class="REGION">American sector</span>, and each one had his own command and they came together in what's known as the commanditoria.</sentence><sentence id="1526">Together they represented one mayor.</sentence><sentence id="1527">They were the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> jointly.</sentence><sentence id="1528">Of course they had a water system, a telephone system, all of these things, light system, all of these things that involved running a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, had to be coordinated amongst the four of them.</sentence><sentence id="1529">In order to get to see Rudolf Hess I had to ask,"Will you let me in?"</sentence><sentence id="1530">My request came through the American representative, Frank Howley, who is generally known as a man who wanted to go to war against the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1531">He used to be called 3 "Howling Mad Howley".</sentence><sentence id="1532">Now, he never said he wanted to go to war against the Russians, but what he did say that got a lot of publicity is "Let's run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> down the <span class="DLF">Autobahn</span> and put a stop to this nonsense" the <span class="DLF">blockades</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1533">Clay was on his way- - Clay of course had seniority in the sense of the overall international picture, but Clay was on his way to report to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when my request arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and Clay was apparently going to be there for several days and Howley saw this as an opportunity to try to get the <span class="DLF">gates</span> open at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> for historians and scholars.</sentence><sentence id="1534">He had no idea who I was and didn't certainly know that I was going to be coming for the defense.</sentence><sentence id="1535">He just knew that I had a title that came out of the American government.</sentence><sentence id="1536">So, he jumped on that and decided that this would be a good opportunity to get the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of pride open into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for some of our people.</sentence><sentence id="1537">In order to accomplish that he would have to put a request on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and ask the Russians, the British and the French to consider it favorably, within 48 hours.</sentence><sentence id="1538">It had to lay there for 48 hours.</sentence><sentence id="1539">Now, the last day of business would be Friday.</sentence><sentence id="1540">He decided to wait until Friday, 10:00 in the morning, thereabouts, put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1541">It would have to lay there for 48 hours which would be Sunday morning.</sentence><sentence id="1542">Then, tell me as he did to arrive at the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> at 10:00 on Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="1543">They hadn't even considered it.</sentence><sentence id="1544">They merely have got it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">commandatoria</span> with a 48 hour rule.</sentence><sentence id="1545">Now, obviously anyone would know right away that this would be a device and I knew it was going to be a device, but I was following instructions, I wanted to get in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1546">And of course there was no trouble getting in under the circumstances but talking to the accused was another thing.</sentence><sentence id="1547">I should say the convicted, the convicts.</sentence><sentence id="1548">Hess was in a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cage</span>, much like an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">animal cage</span> if you can imagine a lion's cage at the <span class="BUILDING">circus</span>, as was Von Schirach, the Hitler Youth leader was in another one.</sentence><sentence id="1549">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were lined up on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for all of the four powers representatives, for myself, my interpreter, and court reporter.</sentence><sentence id="1550">It was a great temptation.</sentence><sentence id="1551">I wanted to get over and start talking to them immediately but I was told by each of three who were there the American, French, and British that their instructions were no, you can't do it unless the Russians show because we don't want a break on this thing.</sentence><sentence id="1552">And the Russians have said no, so I said well, could you get the Russian on the telephone for me and I told him that I was unable to come back.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I told him the truth about that that I had to do it now or never.</sentence><sentence id="1554">And he said well, he was very apologetic, he understood my <span

rather than ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1555">We don't feel that the 48 hour rule has ever meant to circumvent the good orderly approach to consideration of business.</sentence><sentence id="1556">I had to agree that that sounded pretty reasonable to me.</sentence><sentence id="1557">I said, "I'm here and I have to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1558">They're over there.</sentence><sentence id="1559">I'm looking at them right now and as soon as I hang up this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1560">Here I lied to him.</sentence><sentence id="1561">I said I'm going to start these interrogations but I feel that I have to apologize to you and to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because I don't want anyone to feel embarrassed by this but I have to do it now or never, but I do feel that I owe it to you to tell you that one of the subjects I'm going to get into is communism on Hitler's staff.</sentence><sentence id="1562">He was there almost that fast.</sentence><sentence id="1563">Well, he was in a bind.</sentence><sentence id="1564">I sort of calculated that he'd come.</sentence><sentence id="1565">Obviously I knew that that would peak his interest.</sentence><sentence id="1566">He had to answer to something if that happened and I went out of there and said that these two inmates have now identified communist on Hitler's staff, it would have made news.</sentence><sentence id="1567">There's no question about that.</sentence><sentence id="1568">So, 4 he was there to see what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1569">It wasn't the subject at all.</sentence><sentence id="1570">I had no intention of getting into that because I'm not qualified to get into it at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1571">But we did go through the whole thing and we had a little drink and they have a tiny club there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spendell</span> or did have and we all had a little drink and toasted one another.</sentence><sentence id="1572">I understood then the next day then the Russians really created quite a ruckus and <span

that I don't know, probably not.</sentence><sentence id="1575">Now, I mentioned Dick Higgin.</sentence><sentence id="1576">Dick Higgin among his other jobs later, on the State Department's

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1709">A: Well, Hess was my total subject matter had to with why I was there.</sentence><sentence id="1710">Whether or not Lottenbaucher was a high enough member of the Hitler team to have been even considered remotely as a successor to Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="1711">Von Schirach, the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1712">The testimony of Von Schirach was somewhat helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1713">I did put that in evidence as having some sense in it.</sentence><sentence id="1714">Also, by reputation Von Schirach had an American Mother and I think maybe the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> thought he was more believable than if he didn't have any American blood.</sentence><sentence id="1715">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="1716">It wouldn't make sense, but I believe that could have had something to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="1717">Hess, however, his document was pretty much -- he was trying to be cooperate when he found out I was there for the defense.</sentence><sentence id="1718">But he was pretty much giving me a self-serving declaration.</sentence><sentence id="1719">He was trying to make his own distorted views known.</sentence><sentence id="1720">He wanted to make a complaint against <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1721">So, I didn't want to put it in evidence because I didn't think it served my ace very well.</sentence><sentence id="1722">I did offer it to Boisen and Boisen looked at it distinctly and he didn't want it.</sentence><sentence id="1723">So, I still have the original interrogation, otherwise it would have been in evidence just as Von Schirach's was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1739">Q: What had Von Schirach done?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1741">A: On the essentials they both said, they didn't know about any secret meeting that would have considered Lotterbaucher.</sentence><sentence id="1742">They didn't think that was possible.</sentence><sentence id="1743">That was the essential thing, as far as I was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="1744">That's all I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> for at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="1745">And whether the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was influenced by that as much as it was against the witness who was brought in by Boisen, I think my cross examination of that witness was very telling because he admitted to being the father of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> and the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="1746">And you could see the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> immediately, he ought to be hung right here in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1747">And he had one of these large fencing scarves on his face.</sentence><sentence id="1748">Apparently he was one of that club of I'm trying to think, the military clique where they used to bandage their faces up and then they'd hit with a sabre.</sentence><sentence id="1749">You've seen those scarves, I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="1750">I'm trying to think of his name.</sentence><sentence id="1751">It may come back to me.</sentence><sentence id="1752">Right now it doesn't.</sentence><sentence id="1753">Anyhow, have I departed from the general subject around here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1769">Q: What was the disposition of that case?</sentence><sentence id="1770">You won that case?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1773">A: There were a great many people.</sentence><sentence id="1774">I guess you would have to say it was a total victory in some ways because there should have been a lot, put it this way, and I don't mean to be boastful about this.</sentence><sentence id="1775">I think any lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> could have prosecuted that case, any of the chief trial counsel could have prosecuted that case and had a number of hangings including Lottenbaucher's.</sentence><sentence id="1776"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lottenbaucher</span> went scott free.</sentence><sentence id="1777">The Kreisleiter of the particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where some of the deaths occurred some of the deaths and that were ascribed to leadership because of what was known as a Borman (ph) order to dispose of American airman.</sentence><sentence id="1778">The Americans were supposed to be recruited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to be airman and that Borman (ph) order was making a point of the bestiality of the kind of people we were dealing with.</sentence><sentence id="1779">Anyhow there was a lot of the proof that was adduced by Boisen was to try to carry out the influence of the so-called Borman (ph) order, the treatment of flyers.</sentence><sentence id="1780">Normally the Kreisleiter through whom this order would have emanated from the Gestapo and the SS, the Kreisleiter would have been hanged for sure, by a fellow by the name of Peiffer and he only got -- he got life imprisonment but he didn't get death, and of course that means he's out now someplace if he lived through his imprisonment, and all the others with lesser sentences.</sentence><sentence id="1781">The only one that went free as far as I know is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lottenbaucher</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1782">He was keynote in the trial.</sentence><sentence id="1783">He should have -- I was relying more on Boison's failure than I was on any talent of my own.</sentence><sentence id="1784">Every day at the end of the trial, I've forgotten how long that case went on.</sentence><sentence id="1785">It may have been a couple of weeks, but anyhow I'd go up to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and pick up the notes that were left by the Judges.</sentence><sentence id="1786">This is an old trick in these things anyhow, and then I'd knew pretty much how the judges were feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1787">I lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1788">At that point I had moved out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as I was so depressed living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> that I finally asked permission to live in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that was reserved for the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> and they had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they let me have there and I knew these judges very well.</sentence><sentence id="1789">They were mostly pretty good solid military men and they made good judges as a general thing, but they were very prejudiced I'm sure against Boisen in this particular case, and they may have been prejudiced towards me out of friendship, although I think that probably would have been a minor part.</sentence><sentence id="1790">But I picked up these notes and a lot of them would say "Why doesn't Donihi pin back Boisen's ears."</sentence><sentence id="1791">Well of course the court member didn't realize that I was waiting for them to do the pinning back.</sentence><sentence id="1792">It's an old defense ploy, but it gave me a quick readout as to how their minds were running at the end of every day.</sentence><sentence id="1793">And Boisen had a habit if sticking his finger up in the faces of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1794">He get up right close to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and he would just sort of waive his finger and you could see the expression on their faces you know.</sentence><sentence id="1795">They wanted to clip him, and he was a major, now if he had been a civilian perhaps they might have accepted it better.</sentence><sentence id="1796">He was a major and they were colonels all the way down the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1821">Q: Give me an idea of the kinds of cases that would come across your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lawyer's desks</span> that you would review and decide to do the case or not to do the case and which cases did you want to do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1825">A: Well, I made reference earlier to the Schindler matter, and I had a similar case to that.</sentence><sentence id="1826">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> there was the prisoners called it the <span class="DLF">Wuelfert detail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1827">W-U-E-L-F-E-R-T detail.</sentence><sentence id="1828">There were two, I think they were brothers-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="1829"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuelfert</span> was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but the two man who ran it had a canning, <span class="BUILDING">meat canning factory</span>, a very large, let's say like Armand Hammer or Hormel or something of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="1830">They had made literally millions and millions of dollars out of the slave labor they had working there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1831">Everyone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wanted to get into the Wuelfert detail because they were treated so well.</sentence><sentence id="1832">They had a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to rest and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1833">They stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="1834">They didn't return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, except for some grave infraction they were never taken off that detail.</sentence><sentence id="1835">They were there until the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1836">They were well fed, well treated.</sentence><sentence id="1837">So in a matter there was a similarity to Schindler here.</sentence><sentence id="1838">But as I looked at the case, nobody seemed to want to try that case that lawyers are sort of picking and choosing what they wanted to try which I guess was a fair way to do it because they do their better work that way.</sentence><sentence id="1839">And no one seemed to want that one and I decided I would try it myself, because to my way of thinking, I didn't care how good they were to the prisoners, it's the fact that they were getting rich on these prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1840">Of course, I think if all of the Germans who were using slave labor treated them as Wuelfert did, perhaps it would have been for a better end of the war and maybe we wouldn't have had a war crimes program of the same dimensions.</sentence><sentence id="1841">Schindler and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuelfert</span> were similar in this regard.</sentence><sentence id="1842">Anyhow, I tried them and I remember Claudio Delatallo and Claudio had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1843">Claudio is he in college days had roomed in <span class="BUILDING">University of Belsano</span> I believe it was had roomed with Tagliati who was the head of the Italian Communist Party, who subsequently became the head of the Italian Communist party.</sentence><sentence id="1844">I don't know whether that says that Claudio is involved in communism or not, but he refused, Claudio refused to, some others lawyers did too, to prosecute any of the cases.</sentence><sentence id="1845">The lawyers were expected generally to be on call to either prosecute or defend.</sentence><sentence id="1846">The cases that I defended sometimes I didn't want to defend, but they had to be defended.</sentence><sentence id="1847">I thought you go ahead an do your job on it.</sentence><sentence id="1848">Sometimes I'd turn it down if I absolutely refused to I would be permitted.</sentence><sentence id="1849">But it was considered bad taste not to defend a case if you were asked to.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And somebody had to be there in the defense.</sentence><sentence id="1851">It was part of the regulation.</sentence><sentence id="1852">But Claudio refused to take any for the prosecution, and that was permissive.</sentence><sentence id="1853">And he prosecuted no cases and he defended a lot of them and he was defensive of the whole system in many ways.</sentence><sentence id="1854">Anyhow, Claudio complained to our mutual boss Leo Goodman.</sentence><sentence id="1855">He used to say that this Donihi he is vicious, he is vicious.</sentence><sentence id="1856">I never thought I was vicious.</sentence><sentence id="1857">It's just that I tried to try my cases in a workmanlike manner.</sentence><sentence id="1858">And sometimes I'd try to put the lawyer on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> on trial, that's sort of an old ploy in <span class="BUILDING">trial court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1859">Anyhow, this particular case of the Wuelfert's, Claudio was feeling that very strongly because he was sympathetic with them.</sentence><sentence id="1860">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wuelferts</span> I forgotten the term of years, maybe four, five, six or seven, it doesn't have much meaning at this point as to the time, it was relatively short sentence, and I guess I was asking for the death penalty as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="1861">I had very strong feelings that if you're part of the system using slave labor why, you know you can't fall back on the business that I was nice to the prisoners any more than you could say it was superior orders.</sentence><sentence id="1862">In fact, it's worse that superior orders.</sentence><sentence id="1863">They guy's that saying superior orders is saying I was forced to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1864">This guy is doing it because he's making money.</sentence><sentence id="1865">And if you 7 were there and listening to the various stories about these things that prisoners were required to do and a lot of them died if they were working in the <span class="DLF">rock quarries</span>, they might die.</sentence><sentence id="1866">If they tried to make an escape, the dogs would be sent after them.</sentence><sentence id="1867">They might be torn to death.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Some of them were beaten to death for trying to raid the garbages from the SS men's kitchen, that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1869">It was just unbelievable sort of things.</sentence><sentence id="1870">There were so many people there that I suppose the SS figured a few more less isn't going to make that difference.</sentence><sentence id="1871">They were nearly dead, you hit a guy and he drops over, he can't recover.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1919">Q: In the course of the trial, did you rely more on witnesses or on documents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1921">A: Well, documents were of course the mainstay of the membership in an organization which was considered to be, had been held to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1922">The original <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> trial had held to be infamous and unlawful organizations, criminal organizations, and all you had to have was that document showing the membership and the organizational the indictment against the organization itself.</sentence><sentence id="1923">You could rest on that, but usually you wanted to have a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="1924">You wanted to know something about their particular participation, maybe he was the president of the organization or I should say the Fihrer, the local Fiihrer of the organization.</sentence><sentence id="1925">By the way, I meant to say about Hess.</sentence><sentence id="1926">It was interesting to me that the tenure of Hess's comments and you have more than just reading of the testimony itself, you have to almost hear the inflection in his voice, and he spoke with such fondness of the Fiihrer.</sentence><sentence id="1927">It sounded like he still was hoping for a comeback.</sentence><sentence id="1928">I don't think he expected the Fithrer to come back, but I think he did think that maybe Nazism would.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1937">Q: When you couldn't rely on documents, and you needed to rely on witness was that --?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1939">A: Well, you really didn't have to rely totally on -- you always had a common design to fall back on.</sentence><sentence id="1940">If a person occupied a position in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, or in the Gestapo or the SS or the SA, obviously that was adequate.</sentence><sentence id="1941">You had enough to start with there.</sentence><sentence id="1942">In the case such as the one with the young farmer that was beating someone with a <span class="DLF">fence post</span>, you had to have specific evidence because that was related to a specific event.</sentence><sentence id="1943">Somebody had to know what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1944">Phelps thought he had enough evidence in the sworn testimony with the kid that said that the Ghost made him cave in the head of the airman.</sentence><sentence id="1945">Well, it wasn't enough as it turned out, but normally it should have been.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1953">Q: Did the cases that came across your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> not of parties members but of people who were hired by the system but who were not necessarily party members you wouldn't have that level of documentation?</sentence><sentence id="1954">They were---</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1957">A: No, if I understand that question correctly, whether they were party members or not, you know we're dealing mostly with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and obviously a lot of people in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> who are prisoners were not party members, a lot of them might have been prisoners who should have been tried themselves as habitual criminals, murderers 8 possibly who are in there doing the bidding of the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1958">We call them Kapos.</sentence><sentence id="1959">The Kapos, people who wanted at the cost of the lives of others, maybe I'm being too harsh on them but anyhow, people who were willing to do the bidding of the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1960">Frequently you'd hear of the SS people were interrogating the SS people.</sentence><sentence id="1961">You would hear them say something like if there were any deaths or if there were any killings the prisoners themselves must have done it.</sentence><sentence id="1962">Well, the truth is, is that the SS wanted to let the fault for that fall as much on the prisoner command as they could, the Kapo command, you could call it that.</sentence><sentence id="1963">But there's no escaping the fact that it was the SS really.</sentence><sentence id="1964">There was no way that the Kapo command was not running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but they were doing an awful lot of the chores.</sentence><sentence id="1965">Just like a trustee in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1966">Now, if that's the kind of person that you are referring to when you asked if a person who is not a party member, generally speaking, everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was some kind of a party member.</sentence><sentence id="1967">If you applied for -- first of all, if you joined the Hitler youth, no matter what your age, you're kind of a party member right there.</sentence><sentence id="1968">If you applied for a driver's license, you've joined the automobile club, you were kind of a party member.</sentence><sentence id="1969">You couldn't get the sustenance that it took to keep life going unless you were in some kind of a party structure.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1989">A: Well, anyone who is an SS person or an administrative personnel within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, was automatically going to be tried because he was a member of a common design there.</sentence><sentence id="1990">Anyone who had a position such as a Kreisleiter, we'll say a mayor, we'll say a Gauleiter, a governor, head of the Hitler Youth, anyone who came across say any of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> with that kind of category, was categorically in a criminal organization and therefore, was subject to trial for the criminal acts of that organization.</sentence><sentence id="1991">If you wanted to be more specific about what his particular role was then you dug deeper, but he could have been tried on the common design theory alone, if you wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="1992">Lawyers were reluctant to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1993">I did that with regard to the Wuelfert case simply because I felt like don't let them get off simply because they were being nice to prisoners and letting them eat.</sentence><sentence id="1994">What you're saying in a situation like that is Oh we let them live.</sentence><sentence id="1995">We let them sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> where it was nice and warm.</sentence><sentence id="1996">You could hardly call that kindness.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2005">Q: So, the witnesses if you were going to go deeper, not through documentation but through eyewitness testimony, you would find witnesses of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2006">You wouldn't use generic witnesses about what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in general?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2009">A: Well everybody who came to a lineup of course was -- I see what you're saying.</sentence><sentence id="2010">In general well you could use an expert witness of course, if you wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="2011">I never did rely on them.</sentence><sentence id="2012">I used specific witnesses with specific <span class="DLF">fences</span> or specific conditions.</sentence><sentence id="2013">To that 9 extent you might be using someone generically who could testify as to the conditions of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but you really didn't need expert witnesses on that.</sentence><sentence id="2014">There was much, it was so easily provable with what you had at hand.</sentence><sentence id="2015">I'm not sure maybe if we had used experts as you suggest, maybe you could have shortened the length of some of the trials down to maybe a day or two instead of several days and trying to prove specific things, but that was not my practice anyhow.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2029">A: Thad a lot of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2030">A lot of that had to be turned over to -- we couldn't possible try all the cases that were there.</sentence><sentence id="2031">That's why we were trying hysterically to get the most important things out.</sentence><sentence id="2032">Important in terms of the maximum number of deaths.</sentence><sentence id="2033">The gravest offenses.</sentence><sentence id="2034">Those things which we felt should be given a priority in trial.</sentence><sentence id="2035">It wasn't at all possible.</sentence><sentence id="2036">So, I guess whatever was left over went to the Germans for trial.</sentence><sentence id="2037">I sort of washed my hands of the whole event, because I didn't go with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> with the rest of the team who took on the job of reviews, but then I went up to Clay's staff as I've just indicated, and that removed me totally from war crimes for the time being.</sentence><sentence id="2038">0 Tape #3</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2051">A: I think the first time was when I came back after being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on emergency, I was asked at the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> -- I had to make some reports for Mr. Keenan, the Chief Counsel, and I was asked if I would consider taking a job in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2052">I think the feeling was that maybe I would be able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and get back and forth <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2053">Everyone knew that I had had this emergency.</sentence><sentence id="2054">But I sort of tucked in my back pocket for future consideration, and then I was asked again after I had resigned.</sentence><sentence id="2055">That was several months later, and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and thought about it and then I called them and said yes, I would take it.</sentence><sentence id="2056">It was that simple.</sentence><sentence id="2057">I got orders to report that they've given time to the <span class="BUILDING">court of departation</span>, I guess they called it, the fourth of December 1946.</sentence><sentence id="2058">I was there and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2059">It was terribly cold when I arrived and went from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2060">It was just a hop skip and jump and then I went to work immediately after the first of the year trying cases.</sentence><sentence id="2061">I tried cases all of 1946 and 1947.</sentence><sentence id="2062">I guess there was two years of trial work, quite a few cases.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2075">Q: About how many?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2077">A: Ok, I guess if I were to count the ones that passed across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> for someone else to try that I was just looking for trial, I would have to say probably close to a thousand cases that went through my hands.</sentence><sentence id="2078">And I was in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> almost every day of the five days of the week trying some part of some case, so you could figure that five days a week, not necessarily a different case each day, but if you were to count it that way that would be 20 cases a month that I myself would be trying which would add up pretty close to 200, maybe in the neighborhood of 200 cases a year, or 500 cases that I personally probably tried, or was part of a trial.</sentence><sentence id="2079">I wasn't necessarily the lawyer because a lot of these cases had several lawyers in them.</sentence><sentence id="2080">On the <span class="REGION">prosecution side</span> you would have several lawyers for one reason or another, break down the work.</sentence><sentence id="2081">On the <span class="REGION">defense side</span> frequently you would have conflicting testimony, conflicting interest so that they had to have different defense counsel.</sentence><sentence id="2082">Each accused was entitled to his own counsel.</sentence><sentence id="2083">If it in any way conflicted with the trial of the others on trial.</sentence><sentence id="2084">There's -- you know I'm just one of several lawyers that was trying cases.</sentence><sentence id="2085">I think Phil Denson who was there before I was probably tried more significant cases than I. Certainly the Buchenwald case was more significant public relations wise and it was the original -- I tried several Buchenwald cases, but they were sort of subsequent, the wrap up of the administration.</sentence><sentence id="2086">He got the top people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in whatever cases he tried.</sentence><sentence id="2087">Bill would know more about the original conception of those trials over there than I would.</sentence><sentence id="2088">I think he was there from 1945 on, whereas I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, Johnny come lately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2101">Q: How did it come about that people were able to say, "I will not defend anybody?"</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2105">A: I guess there were three people, if I'm not mistaken, Joe Frisky who is close to the <span class="REGION">upper peninsula</span> in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>, not quite that far north, but he was a judge up there.</sentence><sentence id="2106">He was a very nice man.</sentence><sentence id="2107">I think he's one of those who preferred just to defend.</sentence><sentence id="2108">I think partly it's out of a habit pattern of being a defense lawyer much of their lives.</sentence><sentence id="2109">I mentioned Claudio Dellatalla.</sentence><sentence id="2110">I don't know why Claudio did.</sentence><sentence id="2111">Claudio would sit in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of people, and I think a part of it was just mischievous because if he wanted to start almost a riotous conversation, he'd say well one of these days they're going to erect a statue out here of Hitler and part of it's going to be because he had the right idea.</sentence><sentence id="2112">Oh my Lord, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> would divide right down the middle.</sentence><sentence id="2113">People were ready to throw rocks not only at him but at each other.</sentence><sentence id="2114">He could start a lot of arguments that way.</sentence><sentence id="2115">So, you have to draw some conclusion from that.</sentence><sentence id="2116">Maybe he was anti-semitic.</sentence><sentence id="2117">It seemed so.</sentence><sentence id="2118">Maybe it was just mischief.</sentence><sentence id="2119">I can't imagine, but he was one of those that only defended.</sentence><sentence id="2120">Frisky only defended.</sentence><sentence id="2121">I'm sure the motivations were not the same.</sentence><sentence id="2122">Don Ross, a Navy captain, I don't remember him prosecuting any cases.</sentence><sentence id="2123">He seemed to prefer defending, but I think in the case of Frisky and Ross, I think they probably had experience in defending cases more than in prosecution, and I must say, the prosecution of the cases to a trial lawyer in a setting like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> is not any challenge.</sentence><sentence id="2124">The challenge to a lawyer sometimes means a great deal, and I think probably those who are prosecuting cases must have had the experience that this is sort of spearing fish in a barrel.</sentence><sentence id="2125">I defended some cases out of a sort of a feeling that you have a duty as a lawyer not to just prosecute all of them, and I defended some cases that I would have rather have prosecuted.</sentence><sentence id="2126">I mean personally would have rather prosecuted because of my distaste for the deeds that were really provable in the case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2149">Q: Were there lawyers who refused to defend anybody?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2151">A: Yes, I think many of the Jewish lawyers did, and quite understandably.</sentence><sentence id="2152">They had such a feeling of antipathy in that setting, gosh, how can you possibly be fair and impartial.</sentence><sentence id="2153">Fair is one thing, impartial how can you be impartial if you have relative and friends neighbors who have been affected by these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in an adverse way.</sentence><sentence id="2154">So, I can understand why they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2155">I knew several of the lawyers there who absolutely would not take on a defensive case.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2161">Q: Can we talk a little bit about witnesses and was it difficult using survivors as witnesses given the trauma that they had just gone through?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2163">A: Yes, it was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2164">| recommend that is a good tea.</sentence><sentence id="2165">I remember seeing, this hardly enlightens, but, an image comes to my mind of Churchill on one occassion when he was addressing a joint session of the Parliment and he had a suprised look on his face as he picked up what he thought was a glass of water. "</sentence><sentence id="2166">This is really tea."</sentence><sentence id="2167">But-- There were so many people.</sentence><sentence id="2168">They came into your <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2169">You got their names, you asked to speak with them because you know that they're witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="2170">They've been through a line up procedure.</sentence><sentence id="2171">And you kind of feel that in my situation, here it is a couple of years after they have been 2 released from that terrible encampment, you kind of expect they're going to come in looking fairly healthy.</sentence><sentence id="2172">And they come in and they're still emaciated.</sentence><sentence id="2173">They're trembling.</sentence><sentence id="2174">They've lost teeth.</sentence><sentence id="2175">Their memory seems to lapse.</sentence><sentence id="2176">Their eyes show various kinds of distress.</sentence><sentence id="2177">You talk to people like this day after day, it's not long before you begin to feel a little bit like them.</sentence><sentence id="2178">It's a terrible sensation, really to realize -- I guess I could illustrate this because none of us could possibly know exactly what it's like to be in one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> any more than we could unless we've been in battle we couldn't know what it's like to be shot in a battle.</sentence><sentence id="2179">I guess it was Easter of 1947.</sentence><sentence id="2180">Three of us went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together, and we found that our money was rapidly running out.</sentence><sentence id="2181">The <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> prices were just out of this world.</sentence><sentence id="2182">If you went into a <span class="BUILDING">French nightclub</span> some waiter had put a 10,000 frank bottle of champagne on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and uncorked it before you even had a chance to say I don't want it.</sentence><sentence id="2183">It seemed like everyone was grabbing.</sentence><sentence id="2184">There were a few things that were frozen.</sentence><sentence id="2185"><span class="INT_SPACE">Hotel rooms</span> were frozen in the war time price freeze.</sentence><sentence id="2186">Transportation other things -- so we decided that we just couldn't afford the life that was supposed to be a Parisian gay life.</sentence><sentence id="2187">We better get back to work, and I checked with <span class="BUILDING">Horley Airport</span> to find out how we could go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> by <span class="DLF">air</span> without spending too much money.</sentence><sentence id="2188">I found out that they had a war time price freeze on air travel.</sentence><sentence id="2189">It was very inexpensive.</sentence><sentence id="2190">We were going to be able to fly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> for less I guess than it had cost us to come down by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, so we decided we would do that and we could exchange our French francs such as they were or on a one to one basis for Algerian francs.</sentence><sentence id="2191">And then at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> for Tunisian francs and then we'd be on our own getting Roman or getting Italian lira.</sentence><sentence id="2192">Well, we had some difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="2193">We got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> on the first leg of the journey and we're going through immigration and the chap who was checking us told me over and over again you can't go because you don't have a visa.</sentence><sentence id="2194">And I kept handing him my passport saying but I have a diplomatic passport.</sentence><sentence id="2195">You have no visa, which he was talking French, and I don't know much French, anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="2196">I had pushed by b-4 bag back at him.</sentence><sentence id="2197">These other two people with me were looking kind of uncomfortable as though they were willing to turn around and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2198">I kept pushing my bag towards him because he picked the bags up and moved them over where they go up a <span class="DLF">ramp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2199">Finally in some disgust, I guess he figured let them learn for themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2200">He took my bag and he pushed it over and he just waived us on.</sentence><sentence id="2201">So, we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> and to our amusement and misfortune we found that the immigration Frenchman there was excellent in English and he said, I am awfully sorry, you cannot come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> without a visa, an admission.</sentence><sentence id="2202">I said, "Well, we won't be any trouble.</sentence><sentence id="2203">Just let us-- we'll make our reservation back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2204">He said, "I'm awfully sorry, but you cannot leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> without a visa, an exit visa.</sentence><sentence id="2205">So, I said, what are we going to do.</sentence><sentence id="2206">And he said, well where are you headed what are you going to do and one thing and another and I said we were with the war crimes program.</sentence><sentence id="2207">It seemed to impress him, and it was true that I was going to try a case when I went back involving the death of some 10,000 Frenchmen.</sentence><sentence id="2208">So, I was able to tell him truthfully that from the French point of view it was important for me to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2209">So, he called a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we got what they claimed was Eisenhower's <span class="INT_SPACE">suite</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2210">It was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="2211">We learned it was very little cost, very lost cost.</sentence><sentence id="2212">And the same bottle of champagne, for example, that would have been 10,000 francs was something 3 closer to 100 francs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2213">It was crazy this difference in prices.</sentence><sentence id="2214">So, we felt rich.</sentence><sentence id="2215">We were having a great time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2216">We were told that we'd have to see their <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> and our own <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> on Monday, which we did.</sentence><sentence id="2217">We there on the weekend.</sentence><sentence id="2218">So, after enjoying a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>, I-- foolishly -- I did it without checking things that needed to be checked.</sentence><sentence id="2219">I made reservations by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span> after I had gotten our visas.</sentence><sentence id="2220">I had gotten visas for us to leave by way of, I don't know whether it was Mason Blanc Air (ph), but anyhow, an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>, and that's stamped in the passport that we're going to need the visas.</sentence><sentence id="2221">Well, we got onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2222">We couldn't get transportation out by <span class="DLF">air</span> so we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and dumped out on the dessert -- we had <span class="INT_SPACE">state rooms</span>, -- dumped out on the dessert when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> turned south and we were stranded waiting for the next one to come along.</sentence><sentence id="2223">It was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="2224">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was packed with Arabs and kids that were noisy.</sentence><sentence id="2225">We waited several hours out there on a little <span class="DLF">platform</span> in the middle of the dessert with little bonfires going around, it looked like tribal bonfires.</sentence><sentence id="2226">It was not exactly an exciting scene, and then when we got to the border of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span>, I was taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and told that we were not permitted to go through on the visa because it said we were going to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> by <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2227">What do you do?</sentence><sentence id="2228">I was trying to tell them in French that I was involved with the criminals--the war criminals.</sentence><sentence id="2229">They got the wrong impression from that.</sentence><sentence id="2230">They thought maybe I was an escaped war criminal and giving us a very hard time.</sentence><sentence id="2231">We finally got an English interpreter who explained to them that I was a prosecutor that there were 10,000 Frenchman involved.</sentence><sentence id="2232">So, the chap called the chief of police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span>, got authority for us to come through, back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and the chief of police met us in his own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2233">Enough of that.</sentence><sentence id="2234">I'm going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2235">That first night in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we were having dinner and the desk clerk came in and said, there's a gentleman here who wants to speak with you, and I thought right away maybe the police are here because of the way we came in without visas.</sentence><sentence id="2236">It turned out to be a gentleman who was in the high -- boots of a field engineer.</sentence><sentence id="2237">He was a civil engineer in the engineering trousers suit.</sentence><sentence id="2238">He had the dress of his profession.</sentence><sentence id="2239">Invited him to have coffee and dessert with us and he was very belligerent.</sentence><sentence id="2240">He said you owe me some money and I said you know what money do I owe you.</sentence><sentence id="2241">He explained that he and his wife were Buchenwald survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2242">That when they were released at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> they agreed between themselves they would never again speak of the terrible things that they've been through.</sentence><sentence id="2243">They were going back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2244">They did apparently went back, I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2245">They went back there and still the surroundings were constant reminders of the Nazi occupation and the things that had happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="2246">So, he apparently obtained work and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2247">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span>, he said they succeeded in not ever talking about it again, but two letters came, one to him and one to his wife.</sentence><sentence id="2248">The kind of letters that we sent out to the survivors asking them to come back and go through this lineup procedure, give testimony, stay and identify and be part of the whole trial procedure.</sentence><sentence id="2249">So, he said they took these letters and they sat down and they cried.</sentence><sentence id="2250">He and his wife both sat there and cried.</sentence><sentence id="2251">It was pathetic.</sentence><sentence id="2252">If you looked at this man you knew how serious he was, and that they decided that they did have a duty, one of them would go.</sentence><sentence id="2253">He was the one who was going to go, so he immediately went.</sentence><sentence id="2254">He paid his own way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Dachau hotel</span>, automobile rental, all his food, he paid for and he said and nobody has ever reimbursed me.</sentence><sentence id="2255">It seems to me to be very obvious because obviously the U.S. Army is really running that operation and you'd 4 have to have travel orders to travel on and with these orders you would get your meals.</sentence><sentence id="2256">You would get everything in the routines that are provided by the military.</sentence><sentence id="2257">I'll tell you what.</sentence><sentence id="2258">I'll take the facts down as you give them to me and present them back to our finance officer and then he may be in touch with you and you can work it out between yourselves.</sentence><sentence id="2259">He was very grateful.</sentence><sentence id="2260">He said let me come back and take you all to my <span class="BUILDING">night club</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2261">Well, we wanted to see some of the <span class="BUILDING">nightclubs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2262">He took us out on the Gold Coast and we went to three clubs, and these things were posh.</sentence><sentence id="2263">You know, the sort of thing you'd expect to find in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Las Vegas</span> and he threw away an awful lot more money on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roulette tables</span> than we ostensibly owed him.</sentence><sentence id="2264">I asked him afterwards how come.</sentence><sentence id="2265">He said, well it's the principle of the thing.</sentence><sentence id="2266">You caused us a lot of pain, an awful lot of pain, and you're going to pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="2267">It meant an awful lot to him.</sentence><sentence id="2268">It was evident.</sentence><sentence id="2269">Well, I did present this thing back to our finance people and I suppose if he's lucky why he got this money, but if he's not, it's still in the court of claims.</sentence><sentence id="2270">Anyhow, the only point is that was a terrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="2271">These were people who didn't want to come back, who wouldn't have come back except that we appealed to their loyalty to those who had not survived and the need for someone to come and identify the malefactors.</sentence><sentence id="2272">So, he did, but you see he was in a very unhappy state to have to do that.</sentence><sentence id="2273">It was hurting him personally.</sentence><sentence id="2274">And that's the kind of thing that everybody came with.</sentence><sentence id="2275">Those terrible memories that they had.</sentence><sentence id="2276">They didn't want to come back.</sentence><sentence id="2277">They didn't want to repeat it.</sentence><sentence id="2278">You may be able to tell in talking to me or listening to me that I am troubled when I even reflect back on my secondhand experience in living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2279">It was really terrible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2397">Q: In some ways you don't want to talk about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2399">A: Well it isn't a matter of not wanting to.</sentence><sentence id="2400">It's had an affect on you and I dare say that every one of the people who were there, and went through it, after all they were all human beings, day after day after day, you put in two years of this sort of thing and one day after another and you get some feeling of being on sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carousel</span> that's never going to stop in the atrocity.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2403">Q: Did you and the other lawyers talk about this?</sentence><sentence id="2404">What affect it was having on you all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2407">A: No, I don't guess we did in that sense.</sentence><sentence id="2408">I have no memory of -- we talked about specific cases, of course, I mean I might mention to someone what I thought about a case that I was trying.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2411">Q: Did you notice things that happened to you?</sentence><sentence id="2412">Did you have bad dreams?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2415">A: I probably did have a lot of -- I did have some nightmarish dreams.</sentence><sentence id="2416">I still do as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="2417">1 woke up screaming one time a few days ago.</sentence><sentence id="2418">My wife was wondering what had happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="2419">That has been a long time since that had happened before, but that was in the last few days.</sentence><sentence id="2420">Curious isn't it, these second hand affects.</sentence><sentence id="2421">I guess that's a fair analysis, but, anyhow, all these people coming in day after day after day.</sentence><sentence id="2422">Men, women, what should have been children, now grown up, young people in a terrible condition that 5 they are in.</sentence><sentence id="2423">It's a terrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="2424">I recall meeting some of the survivors even at this late date, so long afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="2425">I taught a foreign affairs seminar out at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockwell</span> and I met quite a few of the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2426">Some of them attended my <span class="BUILDING">class</span>, as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="2427">I had the same impression.</sentence><sentence id="2428">They never recover.</sentence><sentence id="2429">They never recover.</sentence><sentence id="2430">Some of them seemed to have recovered, but they just don't, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2431">And to illustrate some of what I'm talking about, under the law of return, of course as you know, a lot of people who go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, did go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, had claims.</sentence><sentence id="2432">And I used to use as a speaker a lady who was assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> from here, I think she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jeruselum</span>; I think she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, but she was a lawyer and assigned to do some legal work here for a year or two, and she used to come out and talk to my class at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockwell</span> at the Montgomery college foreign affairs seminar that I had.</sentence><sentence id="2433">Her job when she was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in, I don't know whether it was the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span>, but she was in the application of some of the laws under the law of return, was to decided who was going to get a portion of the money which had been paid in reparations.</sentence><sentence id="2434">So, she would say this one is entitled to this much, that one is -- and I suppose no one ever got enough.</sentence><sentence id="2435">She said it was very painful and she herself, you could tell in talking with her that she was suffering as a consequence of the affect of it.</sentence><sentence id="2436">It was very interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2459">Q: Is there anything more you'd like to say about the war crimes trials?</sentence><sentence id="2460">Were they sufficient, were they insufficient?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2463">A: The language I can think of -- we were talking about the attorney general Tom Clark.</sentence><sentence id="2464">I was in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on one of my trips <span class="BUILDING">home</span> reporting to him, and a congressman was in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at that time and several of his deputies were up there and I was just standing in the group of them, and because I was present the subject got around to war crimes program.</sentence><sentence id="2465">There were some demurer being raised about what is it doing?</sentence><sentence id="2466">How do we justify it and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2467">Everybody had a different view.</sentence><sentence id="2468">I recall what he said, "Well, it all does seem to be expo facto, but what the hell are you going to do with those guys?"</sentence><sentence id="2469">That I think says it all.</sentence><sentence id="2470">What are you going to do with them?</sentence><sentence id="2471">You can't let a thing like that go.</sentence><sentence id="2472">I've been asked several times about what to do about -- and I wrote an article about the Gulf War crimes, some part of it is about the Gulf War crimes.</sentence><sentence id="2473">What are you going to do with a fellow like Saddam Hussein.</sentence><sentence id="2474">Is he supposed to go free?</sentence><sentence id="2475">Apparently he is, but you have no proper record.</sentence><sentence id="2476">You've got a newspaper record.</sentence><sentence id="2477">You've got perhaps some military records, but this is not the same.</sentence><sentence id="2478">You really need a judicial record of this sort of thing in order to justify the existence of war crimes.</sentence><sentence id="2479">If he goes free it sort of justifies winking and letting him go free across the board in the future, despite the fact that the U.N. has now authorized a war crimes program, but it's not going to be any better than the nations who apply it.</sentence><sentence id="2480">Apparently <span class="COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Kuwait</span> they don't want to apply it.</sentence><sentence id="2481">I had taken the position when I was asked in those days of the Gulf War, after the Gulf War, what to do about it.</sentence><sentence id="2482">My feeling was we don't have to be involved personally but we should encourage the Saudies who would have a case, the Kuwaities who would have a case, the Egyptians who would have a case, and certainly the Israelies who would have a bigger case, that all of these would have a voice, but somebody should try these scoundrols meaning Suddam Hussein.</sentence><sentence id="2483">Otherwise you don't have a judicial history of the thing.</sentence><sentence id="2484">To 6 answer specifically the question about what I think about the war crimes case, it does give you a judicial history that condemns certain kinds of behavior.</sentence><sentence id="2485">That's important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2509">Q: Was it enough?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2511">A: Well, its as much as we could do.</sentence><sentence id="2512">You know, there were a lot of people that got off light.</sentence><sentence id="2513">Really the war criminals who did not get hanged in the ming and in the European and Asian Theater, but particularly in the <span class="REGION">European Theater</span>, they can thank God that they were tried under a Western System of justice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
