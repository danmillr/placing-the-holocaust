I've learned, very sympathetic to Hitler and was very much involved locally or never... I don't know whether he just took over the business, didn't buy it.</sentence><sentence id="25">But I know there was all the family felt pretty badly about that.</sentence><sentence id="26">And some members of my family never want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">Her two sisters have never gone back.</sentence><sentence id="28">We did a little bit of exploring.</sentence><sentence id="29">My mother, there's a small <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>, my mother had a sister who died, a fourth sister, who died early, either when her mother gave birth to her... her mother had been married, her father had married twice.</sentence><sentence id="30">But there is the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of the young child, who either died, was like a month old.</sentence><sentence id="31">And so that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was still kept in quite good condition.</sentence><sentence id="32">I don't think there was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="33">It's coming back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="34">But we really did not meet any members of the Jewish community and I doubt if there are any Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberstein</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">Because when we did go, we then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">We had not been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> at all, because it was in the East zone.</sentence><sentence id="37"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was in the West zone and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> is the next large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe River</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">So when we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, they were having, it had been badly bombed in several major raids.</sentence><sentence id="39">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of about three hundred thousand people, an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="40">We lived in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, we'll get to this a little bit later, but we had... and the Russians had renamed all the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, so they were just starting to rename them back.</sentence><sentence id="41">And so we had a little trouble finding, trying to orient the map to show Mother where we used to live and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> we used to live in, where it was.</sentence><sentence id="42">Now there's just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">memorial tablet</span> in the <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">office building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">But that is gone.</sentence><sentence id="45">But then we, it happened that during the week we were there, they had a memorial exhibit to the Jewish community from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> in one of the... there's a <span class="BUILDING">cloister</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="46">There's a very large <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, which is fairly famous.</sentence><sentence id="47">And there was actually, the week we were there, they were having a, one of these annual conferences of the 3</sentence><sentence id="49"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 4 Protestant gathering in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that moves around.</sentence><sentence id="50">All the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> were there and they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booths</span> set up and they had services in the main square.</sentence><sentence id="51">And one of the groups there was a group that was trying to promote better relationships between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">And they, they were not Jewish, but that was the mission of this group.</sentence><sentence id="53">And they pointed us in the direction of some people who knew some of the Jewish folks.</sentence><sentence id="54">Again, we went to see this exhibit and I can get into that with you a little bit, because one of the exhibits involved, it was a diary written by the person who was the Rabbi in the congregation with my father, who had written a diary when they were picked up to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">I mean to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">So, this is a long winded way of telling you that there, we know there was a Jewish congregation.</sentence><sentence id="57">When we were walking around the <span class="BUILDING">city buildings</span>, and we had this...bumped into this woman who was Jewish or who knew the Jewish... had some connection.</sentence><sentence id="58">And she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span>, worked with the mayor, just happened.</sentence><sentence id="59">And so, it happened when we were walking by that the mayor came out and we spoke to him a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="60">And he said they were just trying, starting, he was interested and glad to meet mother and said the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was starting to put together an event like a lot of other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> had done, to bring the Jewish members of the congregation or for the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> for a kind of gathering and reconciliation sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="61">But I don't think that's happened or she continues to get mailings now from the congregation which is... there was not an active <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that we knew of or could find.</sentence><sentence id="62">I think they said there were several hundred families, but we really didn't go out of our way.</sentence><sentence id="63">I've got a book, little brochure at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or here, from that exhibit, which was very touching and very nice.</sentence><sentence id="64">Had a huge <span class="DLF">wall</span>-sized photograph of the inside of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> where my father was the, where my dad was involved.</sentence><sentence id="65">Anyway there were very few Jews, I think.</sentence><sentence id="66">And it was not an organized congregation yet, but we either didn't bump into them correctly.</sentence><sentence id="67">I mean, we were, it was more of a sight-seeing trip than an effort to dig into records about the congregation sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="68">Because we also had a limited amount of time.</sentence><sentence id="69">And so we got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we did drive over to the <span class="REGION">section</span> where Mother, my dad and my mom first lived, when we came there.</sentence><sentence id="71">I mean, when they first, when my father first married Mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Idar-Oberstein</span> and then they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">It was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">garden apartment</span> kind of place, a little young couple's new... I'm sure at the time looked very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="73">That <span class="REGION">area</span> had not been bombed and was still there.</sentence><sentence id="74">It was just much more rundown.</sentence><sentence id="75">I mean it was like going to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was 50 years old.</sentence><sentence id="76">But the flower boxes were there and we did manage to... you know, we drove by where they probably lived or near where they, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">Remarkable for me to see, because my dad didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he bicycled to work every day.</sentence><sentence id="78">People either walked or took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> right into, in the twenties and thirties.</sentence><sentence id="79">I guess he moved to, well I was born in "31, so he and Mother had been married two years.</sentence><sentence id="80">So it was this very pretty little... it was kind of like being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbia</span> and taking a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span>, biking into work every day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="163">Had your father been, you said he met your mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Idar-Oberstein</span>?</sentence><sentence id="164">Had he been from there or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: My dad was a, he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leer</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ost-Friesland</span>, which is in the northwestern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, near the <span class="REGION">Frisian Islands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">And I have a family... I was just looking and we have a pretty good family tree on his mother's side of the family, going back to the 1700s.</sentence><sentence id="170">His father was a junk dealer and he had nine brothers and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="171">He had a large family.</sentence><sentence id="172">And then his father, unfortunately, when he was very young, committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="175"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 5</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: Your father's father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: My father's father.</sentence><sentence id="187">Leaving my mother!</sentence><sentence id="188">with this huge, rather large family when they were... I think at that point he was probably like fifteen or sixteen.</sentence><sentence id="189">And so, he went, spent some years in an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> and then went on to our equivalent of <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and to be a Jewish school teacher, which when you think back about it, was quite an achievement.</sentence><sentence id="190">He had an older brother, Sammy, and several sisters.</sentence><sentence id="191">He also had a younger brother, who also committed suicide.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Your father's younger brother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Yeah, named Meir, who had an affair, I think with a non-Jewish girl, and decided... which was a no-no in a big way back then.</sentence><sentence id="201">But he had several sisters, Jetta and Martha, both of whom married of all things, butchers in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">And they came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">One of them is named Dan de Vries.</sentence><sentence id="204">His wife's name is Martha.</sentence><sentence id="205">They've both died in the last ten years and their son lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">And his wife is actually the woman who published the coffee book for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">His name is Alan de Vries.</sentence><sentence id="208">He'd been married before, but Judy and he've been married for many years.</sentence><sentence id="209">And then he had this other sister, Jetta Van der Wyck, married Nathan Van der Wyck.</sentence><sentence id="210">They came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and had three daughters and she is still living.</sentence><sentence id="211">She's ninety...

Dan de Vries lived, well he actually outlived Alan's mother, but he lived to be about in his eighties.</sentence><sentence id="220">And I think Martha was right around eighty when she died.</sentence><sentence id="221">But my father, you know this large family, his mother's name was Wexler before she was married to a Rosenberg.</sentence><sentence id="222">And her father and her father's father were fairly prominent rabbis in this northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">The Wexler family, that was there.</sentence><sentence id="224">So, there was a very heavy religious influence in my father's family.</sentence><sentence id="225">And my dad was very knowledgeable in Jewish law.</sentence><sentence id="226">He knew the five books of Moses by heart.</sentence><sentence id="227">You could start him in the Torah.</sentence><sentence id="228">If you go into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, the five books of Moses are in the scroll and you could start my father anywhere and he could give you the rest of the passage.</sentence><sentence id="229">So, he was a Jewish school teacher.</sentence><sentence id="230">When he got his degree, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Idar-Oberstein</span> I think originally, probably as a practice teaching.</sentence><sentence id="231">But he came there as a young bachelor.</sentence><sentence id="232">And he met, to be a school teacher.</sentence><sentence id="233">And... or whether a <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> teacher in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">And he met my mother, who was a student.</sentence><sentence id="235">She was like sixteen when he met her.</sentence><sentence id="236">I think he had another, I think he had a year of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="237">And he came and he went.</sentence><sentence id="238">He was, she said a very jealous man, when she was still going with some other, this Hans or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="239">And she was <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 6 18, I guess, quite young, when they were married.</sentence><sentence id="240">Then he took her back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span>, where he got a position with the Jewish, with the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and the Jewish... it wasn't the welfare agency, but it was like the United, not United Jewish Appeal... sort of like the Central Kentucky Jewish Organization.</sentence><sentence id="241">He was assisting the, assisted the rabbi as a, not as the cantor, but as the lay leader, with services and with classes.</sentence><sentence id="242">And then he also taught classes to people, to Jews who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, in Hebrew, and preparing them to go.</sentence><sentence id="243">And I think he wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but my mother did not.</sentence><sentence id="244">She wanted to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, if they were going to leave, because her family was here.</sentence><sentence id="245">And I think my dad really wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but they were, like many others, not really, did not think this thing was going to get as bad as it did.</sentence><sentence id="246">So that's where he met her and then brought her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.133741" long="11.700878">Magdeburg</span> in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">garden apartment</span>, this very pretty, young woman.</sentence><sentence id="247">And then a year later...

I don't know if they ever had one before the war, whether they just got... I mean the Jewish community learned right away about his vast knowledge of Jewish culture and religion and that he could actually officiate at a service.</sentence><sentence id="1696">And so he began officiating in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spartanburg</span> and started writing sermons in English.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And did the whole thing, I mean he was quite

had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spartanburg</span>, <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> and were totally in a new environment.</sentence><sentence id="1705">I mean it's always been, I've always thought it's been very remarkable when you 23</sentence><sentence id="1707"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 24 think about it.</sentence><sentence id="1708">I mean, they didn't stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where people spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="1709">I mean my mother and her sisters sort of still speak

which was about seventy- five miles away, I think, also had no rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="1713">And he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gastonia</span>, because there was a family named

brought their whole, their <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing facility</span> over and they were living near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gastonia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1717">So, I think they contacted Dad to see if he couldn't start helping them with services.</sentence><sentence id="1718">And so my dad started commuting between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spartanburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gastonia</span> and officiating at services in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gastonia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1719">And so after a couple of years, Daddy in the

the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> where he went to work.</sentence><sentence id="1720">He started moving up a little bit and became a shift manager and a foreman.</sentence><sentence

about it.</sentence><sentence id="1723">And became very good at it.</sentence><sentence id="1724">And so, several years later, the family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gastonia</span> asked Dad or Mr. Heilbronn asked him if he wouldn't come to work for him as a, I think as a shift manager.</sentence><sentence id="1725">And then he also, when he got to <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1928">Q: I was going to ask you about that.</sentence><sentence id="1929">It seems that, well I've heard other people talk about arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and there being a lot of encouragement for Jews who were immigrating to go to various other parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1930">And so many people just didn't want to do that and felt so strongly about that, that they stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> even though there was no economic opportunity at all.</sentence><sentence id="1931">And I guess this is more of an observation than a question, but your dad seems to have been somebody who was very open-minded and aware of opportunities, and that probably shaped your life a lot, too.</sentence><sentence id="1932">I mean, being a child in a situation where you experienced this extreme disadvantage through having your childhood interrupted so much, and then having your family really be broken apart, and many of them killed.</sentence><sentence id="1933">But for you to be able to arrive in this new <span class="NPIP">place</span> and be kind of honored for who you are and what your history is... it's kind of different than what Jewish kids in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, who were immigrating were experiencing for the most part, it seems to me.</sentence><sentence id="1934">There were so many immigrants, and so many survivors and people who weren't really overall encouraged to talk about what had happened to them.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3277">A: Well, I think, you know, philosophically you obviously, Quakers, if you take that position, take a strong pacifist position, you are in a sense ready to die when someone points a weapon at someone you love and is ready to pull a trigger.</sentence><sentence id="3278">And you're not going to interfere with that sort of situation.</sentence><sentence id="3279">Or you feel that there is never any justification for violent action.</sentence><sentence id="3280">And I don't think I'm in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3281">I mean I think there probably are situations where you may find yourself willing to react violently or to take up arms against somebody else under certain situations, under those situations.</sentence><sentence id="3282">Like a war.</sentence><sentence id="3283">And you use a war to end a war.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3767">A: Well, I think really... I don't know that in 1959 when I graduated, I mean 1962.</sentence><sentence id="3768">That was, <span class="BUILDING">Ole Miss</span> was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3769">And I think Julius Chambers went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlotte</span>, I think we had some very serious discussions about civil rights work.</sentence><sentence id="3770">And it was in the papers.</sentence><sentence id="3771">And I think I really did, while I was on the <span class="BUILDING">campus of UNC</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3772">I mean, by that time it was the foremost issue in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3773">It was school desegregation, Brown.</sentence><sentence id="3774">People were still not complying with Brown!(r).</sentence><sentence id="3775">It was the Ross Barnett!",</sentence><sentence id="3776">Ole Miss. It was the summer of Meredith trying to get in"*.</sentence><sentence id="3777">So, and <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> wasn't on the forefront of desegregation efforts either.</sentence><sentence id="3778">I don't think any of the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> were.</sentence><sentence id="3779">So I think by the time that I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, I thought that I would really want to be in the Division if I could get there.</sentence><sentence id="3780">I think in my mind I was going to come back to the South to practice law.</sentence><sentence id="3781">Or that I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at some point to <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> where my family was living.</sentence><sentence id="3782">And that I felt that what the government was doing was right.</sentence><sentence id="3783">And that it would be a great opportunity to be a part of that as a Southerner.</sentence><sentence id="3784">I guess you kind of feel like you're helping to improve the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you live in from a <span class="NPIP">position</span> where you could do some good.</sentence><sentence id="3785">I think I was pretty convinced that this was not going to happen entirely voluntarily.</sentence><sentence id="3786">And that it would take that kind of activity to do it.</sentence><sentence id="3787">Even though those were very, very small steps.</sentence><sentence id="3788">The Division was very small and was really... there was Meredith.</sentence><sentence id="3789">Most of the work the Division was involved in involved voting rights at the time.</sentence><sentence id="3790">There were very few <span class="REGION">Federal areas</span> where the government had the authority to intervene, besides voting.</sentence><sentence id="3791">There was no legislation yet until 1964 where anything could be done about public accommodations or employment.</sentence><sentence id="3792"><span class="BUILDING">Housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3793">All of those were yet to come.</sentence><sentence id="3794">So John Doar had accepted his position at the end of the Eisenhower Administration.</sentence><sentence id="3795">I think he had only been there a couple of years.</sentence><sentence id="3796">He was a lawyer from <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span>, a plaintiff's lawyer, who was willing to undertake this job.</sentence><sentence id="3797">And then when the Kennedys came in he was in the South, in <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> working.</sentence><sentence id="3798">Normally they might have appointed... Doar was a Republican.</sentence><sentence id="3799">And I think Bobby Kennedy read one of his affidavits he had filed or was looking at one of the cases that he was involved in and was so impressed, he interviewed him and asked him if he would stay on as First Assistant, when Burke Marshall became the Assistant Attorney General!(r).</sentence><sentence id="3800">And he said he would, so he was the boss, that I interviewed with.</sentence><sentence id="3801">And I think he was also somewhat attracted to the fact that I was from the South.</sentence><sentence id="3802">I was also a little older and was a veteran and had done well, so he took a chance.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3841">A: Yeah, it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3843">Q: How did you manage it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3845">A: I mean you just had to bang on his, you had to keep coming down.</sentence><sentence id="3846">But he was traveling so much and I don't know whether it was part of his system.</sentence><sentence id="3847">I mean it was a very small, and some people USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 51 would say a little bit of an elite group of people.</sentence><sentence id="3848">There were several people who had worked in the Division for a long time, who had been in the Department of Justice and the <span class="REGION">civil rights area</span>, the government had not been very active.</sentence><sentence id="3849">We also had authority in police brutality cases already, but I think generally it was not an <span class="REGION">area</span>, it was an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the United States attorneys who were in the various <span class="REGION">states</span> pretty well controlled.</sentence><sentence id="3850">It was seen as something that the government was not doing much about.</sentence><sentence id="3851">Mistreatment of blacks in the South by police officers.</sentence><sentence id="3852">The U.S.attorneys were in charge of that, and many of them were from those <span class="REGION">areas</span> and they were just not going to do very much about it.</sentence><sentence id="3853">I mean the discrimination and segregation was very blatant.</sentence><sentence id="3854">In many of the <span class="REGION">southern counties</span>, there was... I mean Governor Barnett and Wallace"?</sentence><sentence id="3855">just defied the government, said we're not going to let blacks in these <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, right.</sentence><sentence id="3856">And that was the way the voting thing was all over the South at the time.</sentence><sentence id="3857">You could not, blacks couldn't vote.</sentence><sentence id="3858">If they went up to try and register they'd lose their jobs or their lives.</sentence><sentence id="3859">So, it was very, and there were very few resources that were being devoted to doing anything about it, until the Kennedy Administration.</sentence><sentence id="3860">And I suppose the President was still, in retrospect, was somewhat criticized.</sentence><sentence id="3861">But when Bobby Kennedy came in, I mean there were only, this was a very small, still a very small division.</sentence><sentence id="3862">And it started growing, very small, in small numbers budgetarily.</sentence><sentence id="3863">But John Doar's idea and I think Burke Marshall's was to do one step at a time.</sentence><sentence id="3864">And we were in <span class="BUILDING">Southern courtrooms</span> with Southern judges and even Federal judges were oftentimes from a background, from segregated communities and were not willing to step out and enforce the law.</sentence><sentence id="3865">So, when we first started we lost many of those cases, until they were appealed... our job was to... and generally the FBI in many of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> was not sympathetic.</sentence><sentence id="3866">The FBI wanted to, they wanted to go out and solve bank robberies.</sentence><sentence id="3867">What we wanted them to do was to come with us to a <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> and stand there all day with a microfilm machine and photograph voting records, which we would then take back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and we would spend days and nights analyzing those records.</sentence><sentence id="3868">We would, because the FBI was also, most of those people from that <span class="REGION">area</span>, they weren't very good about interviewing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">black community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3869">Probably were not sympathetic to having those people register to vote.</sentence><sentence id="3870">So, we, John developed the notion--which sounds very sensible, but had not happened--of basically going into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and identifying the black leaders either through the NAACP"!</sentence><sentence id="3871">or they'd go in a <span class="BUILDING">funeral home</span> or they'd make a complaint, or one or two people that, do you know this person, and who else, and we would meet with those people and find out that yes, Arwen Donahue tried to register to vote ten years ago or somebody went up to the <span class="BUILDING">courthouse</span> and did try to register to vote a couple of years back.</sentence><sentence id="3872">Her name or his name, and every once in a while you'd find out that they might have let one or two people register.</sentence><sentence id="3873">The guy who owned the <span class="BUILDING">local funeral home</span> or somebody who was well-known in the community, that the white business community was aware of and that the registrar was aware of.</sentence><sentence id="3874">But they would either not let them vote or register at all, because they would lose their jobs.</sentence><sentence id="3875">This job that John Doar, this case John was working on, that Kennedy had read, involved a fellow named Atlas"* in <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span>, who was a farmer, who raised cotton himself.</sentence><sentence id="3876">He had a small <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3877">He went up to register to vote and they found out, and they wouldn't let him.</sentence><sentence id="3878">But beyond that the local ginners then refused to gin his cotton.</sentence><sentence id="3879">He went to a number of <span class="NPIP">places</span>, they simply, they refused, they just would not gin his cotton.</sentence><sentence id="3880">So, he went to <span class="BUILDING">Federal court</span> to try to order them to gin his... to stop interfering with his right to vote.</sentence><sentence id="3881">And that was how that began.</sentence><sentence id="3882">But then John, I think, was up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haywood</span> and some of the <span class="REGION">Tennessee counties</span>, and wherever people USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 52 started writing from, we would get some complaints.</sentence><sentence id="3883">And so we would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and find out who tried to register and get those names.</sentence><sentence id="3884">And especially if they were able to fill out a form.</sentence><sentence id="3885">And what these <span class="REGION">Southern counties</span>, what was going on was they were administering a literacy test.</sentence><sentence id="3886">And basically using a literacy test to deny black applicants.</sentence><sentence id="3887">Teachers, people who wrote very articulate constitutional sections and they would give blacks very difficult sections to interpret, which you and I might not be able to interpret at all.</sentence><sentence id="3888">Or if they gave them an easier <span class="REGION">section</span> they would turn them down.</sentence><sentence id="3889">And at the same time they were registering whites who were illiterate, essentially illiterate, and who wrote, and/or who wrote very incomprehensible answers that didn't make any sense.</sentence><sentence id="3890">It didn't matter what they wrote basically.</sentence><sentence id="3891">And so I've got <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">notebooks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3892">And we would then go back, find the records of those persons, and go to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and ask the black registrant applicant to testify, and they would prove, could prove their literacy. "</sentence><sentence id="3893">Yes, I'm a teacher, I've been a teacher for ten or fifteen years.</sentence><sentence id="3894">I have a Master's from <span class="BUILDING">Tougaloo College</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3895">And then we would have also found the registration forms of those whites who either looked as though they couldn't write or maybe even in some cases there were even x's.</sentence><sentence id="3896">And ask that person, and would have the FBI go out and see the white persons and ask to show them their form and ask them to read, when they couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="3897">And so we would subpoena them to <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, and they would show that they couldn't read or that they were just given help.</sentence><sentence id="3898">They could testify, "Yes I came up and I registered.</sentence><sentence id="3899">I wrote my name." "</sentence><sentence id="3900">What about a constitutional section?"

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4575">A: Yeah, the case had happened in 1964, but the delay, the defendants challenged the legality of the indictment under federal law.</sentence><sentence id="4576">So, the case actually went to the United States Supreme Court on the legal question.</sentence><sentence id="4577">This was not a murder conviction.</sentence><sentence id="4578">You know, it was a... they were charged with conspiring to deprive the defendants of their civil rights.</sentence><sentence id="4579">It's a federal conspiracy charge.</sentence><sentence id="4580">There was an issue of whether that was a crime, because it involved private individuals as well as some law enforcement.</sentence><sentence id="4581">And the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> in that case said, yes it was a crime.</sentence><sentence id="4582">And so then, all that took time, so it wasn't until 1967 that the trial actually took place.</sentence><sentence id="4583">And when I left, one of the last things that I did in 1970 when we left, was to write a brief.</sentence><sentence id="4584">They were about to be, they were still trying to prevent them from their arrest.</sentence><sentence id="4585">They were still raising legal questions.</sentence><sentence id="4586">And I think that... and we were successful in resisting the objections and they finally then took the people who had been convicted -- they weren't all convicted -- to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, where they served their time.</sentence><sentence id="4587">And I understand that they are today, finally, what is this?</sentence><sentence id="4588">1999?</sentence><sentence id="4589">Thirty-two years later they are thinking about charging them with murder, convening a state grand jury finally.</sentence><sentence id="4590">As they did in the Beckwith case.3"</sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean we didn't have the Kennedys come to our wedding, but everybody, a lot of the people from the Justice Department and the Civil Rights Division and our associates.</sentence><sentence id="5192">So, I think they were really, as a general matter, very pleased with what I was doing as a lawyer and the work I did there.</sentence><sentence id="5193">And the work I did here.</sentence><sentence id="5194">I think they would never, there was always the question of why I did I just not go into a <span class="BUILDING">law firm</span> and make a whole lot of money?

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5249">Q: What's your response to that kind of remark?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5251">A: Well, I mean, I think it's the same sort of driving force, in a way, that says they are, historically have valued education, and have seen that if you get an education, that you are motivated to succeed and you can be someone.</sentence><sentence id="5252">And I think African-Americans see that, too.</sentence><sentence id="5253">But I think, I think, as I say, part of it is a vicious circle, part of it is, that's what Jean does, sometimes it's one at a time, that people who are born into these poor economic circumstances, we have a whole generation, we have several generations of welfare in <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span> and in the South.</sentence><sentence id="5254">And it's hard to break that cycle in a variety of situations, people, and we... I don't know that welfare reform isn't all bad.</sentence><sentence id="5255">It can be done, in my mind, and I think Jean's, in a more humane way.</sentence><sentence id="5256">But people have to have some support systems, and if you come out from, if you have a series of generations where education isn't valued, for example in <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span> you could get a very good job mining coal, you didn't need an education for years and years and generations, all you had to do... I mean, it was hard work, dangerous work in some ways.</sentence><sentence id="5257">But it was the kind of work that people knew.</sentence><sentence id="5258">It was all manual labor.</sentence><sentence id="5259">As that ends, people don't have those jobs, and they don't have the options, they find themselves in those situations where there is disparity, they have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="5260">And I think the black, in the South, you have the history of segregation for a couple of hundred years, where you don't have equal opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="5261">Where you have terrible <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, and where you're expected to be a sharecropper, really don't have an equal opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="5262">Then you can't have, those children can't have the expectations of being successful.</sentence><sentence id="5263">Now people debate that nationally.</sentence><sentence id="5264">Black leaders debate that, you hear it all the time. "</sentence><sentence id="5265">We can be successful.</sentence><sentence id="5266">We should not have Affirmative Action."</sentence><sentence id="5267">I think Affirmative Action has been a very successful tool.</sentence><sentence id="5268">But the pendulum has swung.</sentence><sentence id="5269">Now you find Justice Thomas*, and you find black leaders who say, "Affirmative Action is unfair.</sentence><sentence id="5270">It's unfair to whites.</sentence><sentence id="5271">It's unfair in that it gives, we don't need an unfair advantage," or to label it as an unfair advantage.</sentence><sentence id="5272">To some extent it's subjective.</sentence><sentence id="5273">Those are my own feelings about... I think you do have to make additional opportunities available to people who have been historically discriminated against.</sentence><sentence id="5274">We have had it and to try to isolate that advantage to those very few situations where you can actually prove that this company discriminated in this bad way and so they're supposed to overcome that.</sentence><sentence id="5275">But I don't, and I don't think my dad, anymore than anybody else, was... I certainly wish he had been more broadminded about that, I'm just saying he's not perfect, none of us are perfect and he had his imperfections and that was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="5276">As far as philosophically, he didn't go around making speeches about it.</sentence><sentence id="5277">But I think he was still proud of what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="5278">I think it was easy, he would be the first, among others, he would say, "Well they should be, certainly not prevent people," think it was wrong to try to enforce the right to vote or even the right to go to public facilities or to have the same legal rights as everyone else.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5317">A: (Talkover.)</sentence><sentence id="5318">It's the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="5319">I mean it is essentially the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="5320">In a different way.</sentence><sentence id="5321">I mean it's the mistreatment of blacks, maybe it isn't genocide, but there were certainly the lynching periods when many blacks were killed.</sentence><sentence id="5322">Not in the scale that we're used to here, that was true in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5323">But I think it's the same thing that motivates, helped to motivate me to work there.</sentence><sentence id="5324">And work in <span class="BUILDING">legal services</span>, where you're essentially trying to do something similar to that on an individual basis.</sentence><sentence id="5325">To provide those opportunities so that people are at least even in the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> and that they can find lawyers to advocate their positions, which they, in the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span>, which they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.</sentence><sentence id="5326">And I've said many times, I think it's the mark of, a good mark, one of the things that this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ought to be proud of, is the fact that it does fund programs like ours, so that people, and provide lawyers to low-income people.</sentence><sentence id="5327">And even makes it possible to sue the government if necessary, that biting the hand that feeds you, if you have to.</sentence><sentence id="5328">You don't have to do that as much as we did.</sentence><sentence id="5329">But we don't get the funds that we ought to have, that's regrettable.</sentence><sentence id="5330">Just as regrettable as it was that it took so long to get to the days of the civil rights, it took... Brown against the Board of Education is 1954 and we aren't fully at the end of it yet, with regard to higher education.</sentence><sentence id="5331">It takes thirty and forty years.</sentence><sentence id="5332">Court processes are slow.</sentence><sentence id="5333">But I think it all has to do with human rights, treating people, giving everyone the same opportunity, whether they are young or old, or white or black, or... whoever.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5359">A: I met Jean in the Civil Rights Division of the <span class="BUILDING">Department of Justice</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5360">She was, I was the Deputy of the Southeastern Section, which handled <span class="REGION">Alabama</span>, <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5361">No <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> and not <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span>, then.</sentence><sentence id="5362">My section chief was Frank Dunbaugh(tm) and Jean came to the <span class="REGION">section</span> as a research analyst, which she mentioned to you.</sentence><sentence id="5363">They are now called paralegals.</sentence><sentence id="5364">We call them also administrative representatives here.</sentence><sentence id="5365">They do a little different work in my <span class="BUILDING">organization</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5366">But John Doar was invited to speak at <span class="BUILDING">Earlham College</span>* in Jean's senior year, or maybe her junior year.</sentence><sentence id="5367">Her roommate, Dorothy, now Landsberg, was then named Shelton, was in charge of the speaking program, and for some reason she had heard about John Doar's work and asked him to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Earlham</span> to speak.</sentence><sentence id="5368">And he came there and then he, I believe first hired Dorothy for the summer to work for him and he also met Jean.</sentence><sentence id="5369">Or she came to, or she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5370">I don't know whether he hired her then.</sentence><sentence id="5371">They were about, they were the two, I think, the first research analysts.</sentence><sentence id="5372">Dorothy later on after I... and so, Jean came to this section and we began working together.</sentence><sentence id="5373">Of course we were sort of... I was second in charge of the section and she was working on cases, and so | think we once... a group of us went on a skiing trip and that was the first time we had any opportunity to be together socially. "</sentence><sentence id="5374">Cause we were still I guess drawing some <span class="DLF">lines</span> when we were at <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5375">She was just a new employee and working under, not directly under me, but with some other lawyers in preparing cases.</sentence><sentence id="5376">What they would do is <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 72 analyze the documents, like the voting records we brought back.</sentence><sentence id="5377">We similarly started doing the same thing with <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5378">Normally in a school desegregation case, someone like Jean might go into the <span class="BUILDING">Superintendent's office</span> under a court order or voluntarily and start analyzing where the white students and the black students in the <span class="REGION">county</span> lived and why they were not being assigned... say, it was pretty apparent in the segregated school systems that you'd have, especially where there was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span>, that black children would need to pass a <span class="BUILDING">white school</span> to be assigned to their <span class="BUILDING">black school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5379">And to put those patterns together and to analyze how the school system assigned students deliberately, so that white students would be together and black students would continue to be together.</sentence><sentence id="5380">Or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">route buses</span> in a way that made sure that <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> remained segregated.</sentence><sentence id="5381">So they were really analyzing those records, which they would then present to the lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="5382">And the same thing in employment cases, whether, you know, in a large <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, where you looked at the number of applicants for jobs and determined that a black was passed over, even though, let's say that maybe he had made an application to get to a particular <span class="NPIP">job</span> and the company said, "Well you weren't qualified," in another <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5383">By looking at several of those situations you could look, you'd only know from the records whether the person who was actually put in had the qualifications or not, or whether they passed over someone who was black, or they didn't, the black who had applied was obviously qualified, or less qualified than the person they hired.</sentence><sentence id="5384">That kind of analysis, which was then given to the lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="5385">So, that's what Jean was hired to do.</sentence><sentence id="5386">And then we, later on when we were, she had worked there about a year... well, let's see.</sentence><sentence id="5387">It might not have even been a year.</sentence><sentence id="5388">When we went to <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> on this voting rights case, the Jim Clark case, Jean was there with me.</sentence><sentence id="5389">She was involved in some records analysis.</sentence><sentence id="5390">And I almost, we were not yet married, but I almost had to put her on the stand, but I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="5391">And there were a couple of other situations where she ended up in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where, in a case that I was working on, where we began to suspect that John Doar was deliberately sending her to cases that I was working on, since we had started dating or people knew that we had sort of started dating.</sentence><sentence id="5392">So, after we worked on this case involving Jim Clark, we went over to, it was sort of a night and day affair.</sentence><sentence id="5393">She was telling you that we had this unfortunate situation where Lois Baker, who was our

id="5404">And it happened that I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> for a legal services meeting and one of the lawyers who works in my program, Larry York, and I went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Selma</span> for a couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="5405">There was a... they have a small <span class="BUILDING">voting rights museum</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="5406">There were some people around who we visited and I visited Lois, who had since gotten married and had two, several children.</sentence><sentence id="5407">And we were thinking back...She's the head of the computer section at Montgomery Air Force Base or something at this point in time.</sentence><sentence id="5408">But after that Jean and I went over to <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5655">A: I think she'd been there once, I'd have to ask her.</sentence><sentence id="5656">But I think she had been down once and that was probably a clue to them, because I didn't bring women by.</sentence><sentence id="5657">I'm pretty certain that she had been to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> once before.</sentence><sentence id="5658">So, they knew of her and they knew...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5669">A: Well as Jean told you, she was there without me with the both of them facing each other for a little while, so I guess they were a little bit new to each other.</sentence><sentence id="5670">But her father is a pretty extroverted person, who has a lot of interests and was then much younger, quite young.</sentence><sentence id="5671">Was very interested in spiritual things and I think my dad was able to talk to him.</sentence><sentence id="5672">And they got along very well.</sentence><sentence id="5673">And Jean's mother and my mother hit it off really well.</sentence><sentence id="5674">I think Jean's mother had been a secretary and was always doing transcription work of one sort or another.</sentence><sentence id="5675">And in fact, in the last fifteen years or so she would not, well after we were married, Jean's mother wouldn't take a full time job, she worked for Manpower", so they could come down and see Michael or be with the grandson and then the grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="5676">We were both, in the sense that her father's background was German and was the son of a tailor immigrant family.</sentence><sentence id="5677">His mother was very strong.</sentence><sentence id="5678">He grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> at a time when much of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown New York</span> was still <span class="DLF">farm</span>, farming country.</sentence><sentence id="5679">There are some old letters in her family that I was reading when I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, where they were describing the winter and it was cold and they'd have to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> to relieve themselves.</sentence><sentence id="5680">And they were literally living in a farming area where the <span class="BUILDING">United Nations Building</span> is now.</sentence><sentence id="5681">But the point was that they were sort of both from old European generation backgrounds, where the fathers were working and more sort of the dominant, and they were making the money and the mothers were at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> was sort of run the way the fathers said it was run.</sentence><sentence id="5682">And in that way, I think, there was some commonality, even if the religions weren't the same and the families got off to a pretty good start.</sentence><sentence id="5683">They didn't stay very long on that occasion and I don't remember, I mean they saw, saw each other periodically and from time to time.</sentence><sentence id="5684">Jean's parents used to, as she said, came to visit us a lot more.</sentence><sentence id="5685">They came down here a lot.</sentence><sentence id="5686">They really took a major interest in their grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="5687">My parents had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and did not really come up, they made a trip up after we moved here from <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span>, when they were still living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gastonia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5688">As I said my father, "65, let's say in 1966... Let's see, we got married in "67.</sentence><sentence id="5689">He retired about that time and they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> shortly thereafter.</sentence><sentence id="5690">So that we would go see them usually at Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="5691">But they didn't make many trips up.</sentence><sentence id="5692">Right after we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> they made a, they drove over, got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pikeville</span> and the <span class="DLF">four-lane</span> was just being developed, was being blasted open between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pikeville</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5693">So they got within thirty miles of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then had to take a thirty mile detour around the back hollers from Wheelwright and I don't think, I think USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 76 that sort of, was enough for them.</sentence><sentence id="5694">Although they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>, they never really made another big driving excursion up this way.</sentence><sentence id="5695">So I don't know that I have many more, it's one of those things I don't have a lot of... Jean probably recalls better than Ido.</sentence><sentence id="5696">We went back for...after we got married and worked in the Civil Rights Division, when Jean then, when Michael was born in 1970 in April, we had decided then to leave the Division.</sentence><sentence id="5697">That was when the Nixon Administration had come in, and even though I was Chief of the Criminal Section, they were not, pretty much still let me have a free hand.</sentence><sentence id="5698">The Houston school case was one of the last cases that they filed in which the government, which I had written the pleadings in, in which we asked for bussing as a relief.</sentence><sentence id="5699">And they were generally to eliminate segregation, to start bussing black kids across to <span class="BUILDING">white schools</span> and whites to <span class="BUILDING">black schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5700">We didn't get all of that in the relief.</sentence><sentence id="5701">We did pair up some <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and we made some other major improvements.</sentence><sentence id="5702">But they were, in my view, certainly, and others, were retreating on school desegregation.</sentence><sentence id="5703">And it wasn't really... the climate was not what it had been and I, we decided then, I think, that we had been there long enough.</sentence><sentence id="5704">Besides I had been there, was in a very senior position and at that point you're starting to almost price yourself out of the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> if you want to make a career change.</sentence><sentence id="5705">You might stay with the government and decide to go, to keep, to go up another notch or two or maybe make more and more money.</sentence><sentence id="5706">Or if you're going to a <span class="BUILDING">law firm</span>, in order to get a reasonable salary, too, it was at the point where it was a good time for me to do that.</sentence><sentence id="5707">So we, and Michael had just been born, it was a nice time to take off for the summer.</sentence><sentence id="5708">And we decided then to, we would go ona large camping trip.</sentence><sentence id="5709">We got our little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span>, and folded it.</sentence><sentence id="5710">We bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Peugeot</span> for eight hundred dollars that looked like it had a lot of miles left on it.</sentence><sentence id="5711">And we headed North and we went North along the American and <span class="DLF">Canadian coast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5712">We went to the Canadian -- American National Parks, Fundy and all the way along, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cape Breton</span>, out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cape Breton</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prince Edward Island</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5713">Came back to <span class="REGION">Quebec</span> and basically got away from it all.</sentence><sentence id="5714">I think I had one call from a <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> and decided to leave it, not to bother with it.</sentence><sentence id="5715">And we weren't really sure where, we knew we wanted to do something useful, where I felt I was using my legal talents to somebody's benefit.</sentence><sentence id="5716">And I had talked to some <span class="BUILDING">firms</span> and that didn't really excite me at the time, but I think I was just more, we were really more into making the decision to leave, which was a big thing, because we didn't have a job.</sentence><sentence id="5717">But we wanted to get away for a while and we had some money saved up, so we, while I was on that trip one of the... when we came back... what was it?</sentence><sentence id="5718">--Someone left a message for us.</sentence><sentence id="5719">One of my former colleagues from the Division, Terry Lenzner was the head of legal services for the Office of Economic Opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="5720">And he was the one who suggested while we were on this camping trip that we might want to drive through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span>, West, to come through <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> and to <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5721">This is by way of answering you about my parents, because they had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5722">And we were sort of on our way to be at the Jewish, to spend the Jewish holidays with my parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>, which is about this time of year, in September.</sentence><sentence id="5723">So we were off, I think we returned from, we were, went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cape Breton</span> and we went back to <span class="REGION">Quebec</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5724">And it was really cold and we bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tent heater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5725">And then we went from there down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and all of a sudden it was ninety-six and we were staying with former colleagues of the Civil Rights Division, who were in <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span>, I think.</sentence><sentence id="5726">And they had this small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> without an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air conditioner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5727">We were burning up.</sentence><sentence id="5728">Well anyway, we started back down and Terry Lenzner got in touch with us and we went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5729">And the program in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> was then associated with this group in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span>, called Appalachian Research and Defense Fund, which had been founded by three lawyers, four lawyers, who wanted to start a public interest law firm.</sentence><sentence id="5730">And they had begun some environmental work, but were having a tough time economically.</sentence><sentence id="5731">And they had gotten in 76</sentence><sentence id="5733"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 77 touch with Terry Lenzner at OEO and he wanted to, was willing to do some, to fund an organization to do, under the auspices of legal services, to look at some of the symptomatic issues around poverty in the <span class="REGION">Central Appalachian area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5734">Out-of-state mineral interests, black lung disease, environmental damages related to <span class="DLF">coal mining</span>, deep mining and <span class="DLF">surface mining</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5735">And Paul Kaufmann, who was one of the four, there, of those lawyers--there were four attorneys, Kaufmann was a former gubernatorial candidate and was real active in Democratic politics, had been a private attorney.</sentence><sentence id="5736">And John Boettner, fellow named Ratliff?</sentence><sentence id="5737">and a woman named Naomi Cohen.</sentence><sentence id="5738">And then there was a small group here in <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span> of lawyers, who had worked as a group called Mountain People's Rights.</sentence><sentence id="5739">And there was a fellow named Howard Thorkelson, who was from <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5740">And he had gotten a couple of other lawyers to come down here, although they were not yet licensed and they were having financial difficulties.</sentence><sentence id="5741">So the two of them were sort of interested in working together and getting this federal money through the <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> organization.</sentence><sentence id="5742"><span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> then had a Republican governor, Arch Moore*!.</sentence><sentence id="5743">And he was hostile to legal services, as was the Republican governor in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>, Louis Nunn*?.</sentence><sentence id="5744">So there was a, the West Virginia Technical Institute, was an educational institution, so Terry concocted a scheme whereby he would fund West Virginia Tech, because educational grants were not subject to gubernatorial veto as the other OEO grants were and then they would in turn fund Appalred&gt;".</sentence><sentence id="5745">But anyway, I guess I'm getting a little ahead of myself.</sentence><sentence id="5746">I was just, we were on this camping trip and so we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charleston</span> and talked to the people there.</sentence><sentence id="5747">And Paul said, "Why don't you go down to visit with the Kentucky people, because Howard Thorkelson is going to leave and they need someone to replace him and we're going to be funding them.</sentence><sentence id="5748">If you're interested we would seriously consider asking you to take over this group in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>."</sentence><sentence id="5749">So, we came down here and came here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> on an August or a September evening and pitched out <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> out there at Jenny Wiley(tm).</sentence><sentence id="5750">Back then, oh actually the <span class="BUILDING">campground</span> was at the other end up here near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auxier</span>, at that <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5751">Jean wanted me to go out and make sure there weren't any bears or foxes, she had heard... there wasn't anybody there but us.</sentence><sentence id="5752">It was really after the camping season.</sentence><sentence id="5753">But we met the people who were here and everybody seemed very friendly and we decided to go down and... I had already gotten some names of people, Harry Caudill, who you know wrote Night Comes to the <span class="REGION">Cumberlands</span>, was on the Appalred Board in West Virginia(r)".</sentence><sentence id="5754">He was a friend of Paul Kaufmann's, I think, and had been very, Kaufmann had put some people from <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> on his Board.</sentence><sentence id="5755">He wanted this thing to be more of a regional program because there were so many of the issues were common to the <span class="REGION">Central Appalachia</span>, and that the <span class="DLF">state lines</span> really didn't mean anything.</sentence><sentence id="5756">The strip mining problems in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> and <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> were the same.</sentence><sentence id="5757">Unregulated <span class="DLF">strip mining</span>, land owners having their <span class="REGION">land</span> torn up without their consent, and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="5758">So, I went down and talked to Harry Caudill.</sentence><sentence id="5759">There was a woman, here on <span class="DLF">Mud Creek</span> they were doing a lot of, they were having a lot of problems around health issues.</sentence><sentence id="5760"><span class="BUILDING">Hospitals</span> weren't taking people who couldn't pay.</sentence><sentence id="5761">Eula Hall was her name, she is a good friend, who still works at the, founded the <span class="BUILDING">Mud Creek Clinic</span> here in our area"(r).</sentence><sentence id="5762">And I went over into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blackey</span>, <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5763">There was a fellow named Joe USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 78 Begley, who was running a <span class="BUILDING">country store</span>, who was a very strong anti-strip mining advocate?"</sentence><sentence id="5764">And his wife, Gaynell Begley, she had gotten a Master's in Education from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5765">She was a wonderful person.</sentence><sentence id="5766">They... Joe was born here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Floyd County</span>, and he was part Indian.</sentence><sentence id="5767">We talked a lot about their history and the problems that he saw, poor people, and that people were getting run over by strip miners.</sentence><sentence id="5768">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Kentucky</span>'s <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> allowed mining without, strip mining without land owner approval.</sentence><sentence id="5769">Because these out of state mineral owners had come here in the late 1890s and bought out all the minerals.</sentence><sentence id="5770">We were talking about country people and being acceptance of outsiders.</sentence><sentence id="5771">Have you ever read Harry Caudill's book, Night Comes to the <span class="REGION">Cumberlands</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5772">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="5773">Well you know, he describes this situation so well where these land agents for the Northern philanthropists, like Rockefeller and large oil holding and mineral holding companies sent their agents down here.</sentence><sentence id="5774">They would visit these farmers who lived in very remote hollers, where they were farming the mountain hills, really.</sentence><sentence id="5775">And they would come in and tell their stories, and spend the night, talk about all the good things that were going on in the world and how nice this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="5776">And then they would present them, they would suggest to them that they ought to go ahead and sell over their mineral rights because it wasn't really any benefit to them that they could see.</sentence><sentence id="5777">No one knew what <span class="DLF">mining</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="5778">There wasn't any huge deep <span class="DLF">mine</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="5779">The only use they made of their coal would be to cut into the <span class="DLF">hillside</span> enough to get the coal to use for heating up their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> and their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, which is what most of them did.</sentence><sentence id="5780">You could see the outcrop of the coal and they would run a scraper along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and take out a little bit of coal.</sentence><sentence id="5781">But no one... certainly they were aware as they were in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> of deep mining methods.</sentence><sentence id="5782">And I'm sure these agents didn't talk a great deal about the possibility of having a huge, deep <span class="DLF">mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5783">This was in the 1890s, 1900s, was before the time of the <span class="DLF">railroads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5784">And subsequently the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> came in once all these minerals had been bought up, I mean they literally bought up all of the mineral ownership in <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5785">And under the common law, the <span class="DLF">mineral estate</span> is severed from the surface, so what you have left is the land on top.</sentence><sentence id="5786">And they gave them, the deeds they signed as you know, were known as Broad Form Deeds because they were so broad in their language.</sentence><sentence id="5787">They literally gave the owner of the minerals the right to take the minerals and all steps reasonably necessary to build <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="DLF">railroads</span> and <span class="DLF">tram roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5788">Whatever might be necessary that's incidental to taking out the coal.</sentence><sentence id="5789">And then they would sign those minerals away.</sentence><sentence id="5790">And the <span class="BUILDING">Kentucky courts</span> held that those deeds were so broad that they gave the mineral owner the paramount right to the surface owner, as long as the mineral owner didn't arbitrarily misuse that right.</sentence><sentence id="5791">As long as he mined by reasonable methods and took the coal out by an acceptable method, the surface owner could not object to that.</sentence><sentence id="5792">So those, Joe had one of those old deeds and told me what an awful instrument was, that even though at the time when they executed the deeds, no one could have envisioned these current methods of mining.</sentence><sentence id="5793">Bulldozer, mechanic... and these huge, mechanized equipment that was in use seventy-five years later, that the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> would hold that to be allowable.</sentence><sentence id="5794">In most contract law, the contract applies to those things that are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties, like deep mining.</sentence><sentence id="5795">There was no doubt that if you were going to <span class="DLF">mine</span> back then you would deep <span class="DLF">mine</span> to get the coal out.</sentence><sentence id="5796">We never challenged that.</sentence><sentence id="5797">But the notion that they could use a method that was not at all in anybody's contemplation was rejected in other <span class="COUNTRY">states</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5798">Virtually.</sentence><sentence id="5799">I mentioned <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> a while ago, I guess that wasn't really right.</sentence><sentence id="5800">The <span class="BUILDING">West Virginia courts</span> had said you have to have landowner consent.</sentence><sentence id="5801">You could get a surface mining permit and you could pay for that.</sentence><sentence id="5802">And that was what <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>, and <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, and many of these others, <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>, all the other <span class="REGION">states</span>, <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> had said, but not <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5803">So Joe, we talked for <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 79 a long time, was pointing out, also how poor people couldn't get lawyers to challenge those deeds.</sentence><sentence id="5804">And they couldn't get lawyers to challenge a permit application if someone applied for a permit.</sentence><sentence id="5805">But there were many situations where he thought it would be just a wonderful thing if we could have lawyers available to represent poor people.</sentence><sentence id="5806">Because he saw these situations coming up so often.</sentence><sentence id="5807">And so, we went on, we went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> to visit my mom and dad and while on the way I think we kind of decided that this would be an interesting opportunity to try to come to <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5808">It would be a worthwhile way to practice law and to provide that opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="5809">There was a lot of interesting work to be done and useful and perhaps important work to do on behalf of low-income clients.</sentence><sentence id="5810">And also to help start this legal services program, which was, had sort of a small beginning in mountain people's rights.</sentence><sentence id="5811">So then we came...decided to come, and we came.</sentence><sentence id="5812">And moved to <span

(</sentence><sentence id="6095">Laughing.)</sentence><sentence id="6096">Somebody said, I think it was, whatever the various combinations people had been throwing out, was that I suggested it be called Kentuckians Fair Tax Coalition.</sentence><sentence id="6097">But the other issue it took on was the Broad Form Deed.</sentence><sentence id="6098">And the group started very small, it was just kind of a get together really.</sentence><sentence id="6099">One of the members who, one of the folks who was there was a young man named Joe Zakos, who had come from <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> and was interested in working with local citizens groups.</sentence><sentence id="6100">And he had come, was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">David</span>, I think and had gotten involved in some issues over in <span class="REGION">Martin County</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6101">It didn't have anything to do with the Broad Form Deed.</sentence><sentence id="6102">It was really a proposal to move a low-income community out of a flood-prone area.</sentence><sentence id="6103">And they were going to fill it in and put in new <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> or industrial... the only thing was they forgot to discuss it with the people who were living there.</sentence><sentence id="6104">And he organized an effort there to... which ultimately stopped that.</sentence><sentence id="6105">They backed off on that project.</sentence><sentence id="6106">But in the process began a group called the Martin County Concerned Citizens, who then were involved with a number of environmental and socially active, social... got involved in issues of social concern.</sentence><sentence id="6107">We represented them one year in a case challenging the application of... Kentucky Power wanted to build another <span class="BUILDING">power generating plant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6108">And the reason they wanted to build it was to sell more power to other companies, but it would have raised the rates of everyone, including the Martin County citizens, people who lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6109">And we had a lawyer in legal services in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span>, Tony Martin, who focused on energy work, and basically demonstrated that there was no need for the <span class="BUILDING">power plant</span>, that all it was going to do was increase everybody's power bill.</sentence><sentence id="6110">They had plenty of generating power, they were just trying to expand themselves.</sentence><sentence id="6111">And the stockholders might benefit, but the Martin County citizen group was the named party.</sentence><sentence id="6112">And so that was just to say that, even though a group that was called Kentucky Fair Tax Coalition and decided later to rename itself Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, because local chapters were working on different issues of local concern.</sentence><sentence id="6113">Didn't necessarily involve minerals and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="6114">But they really put themselves on the map with the campaign to get the constitutional amendment passed.</sentence><sentence id="6115">So that amendment was on the ballot in 1988, along with the lottery.</sentence><sentence id="6116">And the lottery barely passed.</sentence><sentence id="6117">It passed by, I think, fifty-one or - two percent of the vote.</sentence><sentence id="6118">Ninety-two percent of the vote, people voted for the Broad Form Deed amendment, which showed people knew what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="6119">In fact, I remember when, early when we had been here not too many years, the Courier-Journal | think did an informal poll.</sentence><sentence id="6120">And something like ninety-three percent of the people thought they shouldn't allow anybody to 81</sentence><sentence id="6122"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 82 <span class="DLF">strip mine</span> your <span class="REGION">land</span> without your consent.</sentence><sentence id="6123">But I was then, one of my, the coal industry decided they wanted to challenge the constitutionality of that constitutional amendment as violating the federal constitution.</sentence><sentence id="6124">Because they claimed that mineral ownership rights had been established by these series of Kentucky cases in the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> over the years and that people when they bought mineral rights expected to be able to legally surface mine.</sentence><sentence id="6125">And we argued... and I was representing an older couple in <span class="REGION">Johnson County</span>, Garnet and Eugene Ward, who lived on a small <span class="DLF">farm</span>... they really weren't farming.</sentence><sentence id="6126">It was in a holler that had not been mined.</sentence><sentence id="6127">And there was a mining application by a company.</sentence><sentence id="6128">And at the <span class="BUILDING">trial court</span>, one of the attorneys who was here then was handling, handled that case, and it was on appeal and it came to me and I took the case over.</sentence><sentence id="6129">And we ended up arguing the constitutionality of the amendment in the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6130">And the Attorney General argued in our support and the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> then agreed with our theory that they never had the right in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> to grant the right to <span class="DLF">strip mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6131">So it took a lot of years, but finally the right was... you cannot today surface mine anybody's <span class="REGION">land</span> without their consent.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="6332">The problem was there was no water, the water system was unreliable.</sentence><sentence id="6333">They had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pump</span> that was literally held together by chicken wire.</sentence><sentence id="6334">They were afraid to take the gamble unless they had water.</sentence><sentence id="6335">So we were sort of diverted for a couple of years until we were able to figure out with our local area development district how to, ultimately we were able to get a grant, which helped one of the existing water districts bring water to a number of their new customers in the <span class="REGION">rural part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6336">The Beaver-Elkhorn water district supplied water to a lot of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> on Right and Left Beaver Creek.</sentence><sentence id="6337">By getting them additional, those <span class="DLF">lines</span>, they agreed they would run a <span class="DLF">line</span> over to David, an extension.</sentence><sentence id="6338">And we established a David Water District and went to the Public Service Commission to get approval to bring water to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">David</span> through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">water district</span>, which would buy its water from this Beaver-Elkhorn Water District that agreed to extend its <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6339">And when we got that done, by that time Mr. Tiller had been transferred to somewhere, <span class="REGION">Western Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6340">People were afraid the corporation was going to go in, go down, because he was really sort of a driving force.</sentence><sentence id="6341">But there was an old coal miner, retired, who had black lung, named Ashland Howard, whose nickname was "Hawk".</sentence><sentence id="6342">And he had the energy and the spirit and the--even though he may not have had the formal education--to push this group along.</sentence><sentence id="6343">And he took over, became the Chair of that group.</sentence><sentence id="6344">And we then, once we got the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">water district</span> in, we put together a financing package, where we had a first mortgage from the <span class="BUILDING">local bank</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> and a second mortgage from a group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, called the Housing Assistance Council.</sentence><sentence id="6345">And the idea was that if the corporation could buy the property, all of David, then the renters could buy their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in turn and the <span class="BUILDING">local bank</span> would make those mortgages.</sentence><sentence id="6346">So the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> would turn its money over quickly and get its mortgage paid back as people bought their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6347">And the Housing Assistance Council in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> helped, encourages developments of this sort.</sentence><sentence id="6348">They were, I think we paid them back twice as fast.</sentence><sentence id="6349">So, we were able to purchase the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6350">We had another lawyer, by that time I had another lawyer named Kay Adrion, who works over in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> now as a private practitioner.</sentence><sentence id="6351">And she helped sort of put the deal together.</sentence><sentence id="6352">And then after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>... we did all, this was a <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 85 large amount of legal work.</sentence><sentence id="6353">Public Service Commission, all this deed work.</sentence><sentence id="6354">And we were also able to get the <span class="BUILDING">corporation</span> to realize they needed to get some staff people.</sentence><sentence id="6355">So we helped them to write a Vista grant to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Vista</span> out there.</sentence><sentence id="6356">At the same time a young man named Danny Greene had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">David</span> and started a, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he had taken in some foster care kids.</sentence><sentence id="6357">He came down as a volunteer with the <span class="BUILDING">Mission</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6358">And he started this <span class="BUILDING">David school</span>, which over the years has obtained some national recognition for helping <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> dropouts.</sentence><sentence id="6359">He realized there was no real <span class="BUILDING">alternative school</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="6360">Kids would drop out, that was the end of it.</sentence><sentence id="6361">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> really just wiped their hands of them.</sentence><sentence id="6362">He bought the old <span class="BUILDING">store building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6363">We bought most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="DLF">ridge</span> to <span class="DLF">ridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6364">And he bought several others and was able to get some financing for the old <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, which became the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6365">There's now a brand new <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, which is very beautiful, that has been built in the meantime, and the story of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I've been on their Board and we've done a lot of things together.</sentence><sentence id="6366">But afterwards the corporation built and developed about twenty-five new <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Farmer's Home</span> owned... put up new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where the old ones were, had deteriorated in one of the hollers.</sentence><sentence id="6367">It's a very nice, attractive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="6368">It was sort of the Appalachian, we had this big battle over a strip mining permit at one point.</sentence><sentence id="6369">There was a large block of coal left underground.</sentence><sentence id="6370">I said <span class="DLF">strip mining</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6371">There were some strip mining attempts that we were able to fend off.</sentence><sentence id="6372">But there was also a large amount of coal that had not been mined because they hit water in the <span class="DLF">mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6373">There was an attempt to re-open that, to start, to get a permit to mine that block of coal.</sentence><sentence id="6374">And Danny and the community got very upset about that.</sentence><sentence id="6375">And so we opposed that permit and there was a lot of community pressure, a lot of help.</sentence><sentence id="6376">And thankfully that was, we were able to fend that off.</sentence><sentence id="6377">But we've been very much, you've had deep mining and <span class="DLF">strip mining</span> and coal truck traffic, all the problems that you see all over, in one little <span class="NPIP">spot</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">David</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6378">You have the craft co-operative as a little, as a new, which has become fairly successful.</sentence><sentence id="6379">It's anice community.</sentence><sentence id="6380">There were actually, we had plans to develop other parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">David</span>, to expand it, but basically the community sort of decided it didn't want to get any bigger.</sentence><sentence id="6381">It's a very interesting <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6382">And we learned a great deal and I think had a lot to be proud of in terms of what the community did and the role that we were able to play, because they could never afford it, that sort of legal work, help.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6477">Q: Okay, we were just talking a little bit, off tape, about how many things we'd, I'd still like to cover about your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> and working for, working with Appalred.</sentence><sentence id="6478">And that we probably don't have the time to get into it all today.</sentence><sentence id="6479">So, I was thinking about, when we were just talking a little bit, off tape, about your time here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span>, and maybe you can reflect on your work here and a little bit on just the, what you've, it turns out that you've devoted your life to.</sentence><sentence id="6480">I mean you had the opportunity of becoming a chemical salesman and you decided that wasn't what you wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="6481">And you've gone more and more in the direction of service.</sentence><sentence id="6482">Any reflections or words on that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6489">A: Well, I think what I'm doing now has been in many ways has been most fulfilling over the last thirty years.</sentence><sentence id="6490">Working with the Civil Rights Division was a great opportunity to learn to practice law and to do something very worthwhile.</sentence><sentence id="6491">The big difference is that in the Civil Rights Division, we didn't live in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and that we came and went.</sentence><sentence id="6492">Whereas, and I have great admiration for the people who stayed there and their courage and how difficult their lives were.</sentence><sentence id="6493">The lives, the life we've had for the last thirty years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> has been here.</sentence><sentence id="6494">And I wouldn't at all compare myself to the African-Americans who lived in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> and the life they had and how difficult that was, because we are white.</sentence><sentence id="6495">And we live in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where 85</sentence><sentence id="6497"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 86 there are very few African-Americans.</sentence><sentence id="6498">And I think their life has been difficult at times although it's gotten much better.</sentence><sentence id="6499">I mean there is also a fair amount of blatant racism in this particular <span class="REGION">area</span>, and some of it is direct racism.</sentence><sentence id="6500">But over the years I've been able to recruit, at least the only practicing attorney in <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span> right now, is the woman who has my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in Jackson(r)!.She's been there a number of years.</sentence><sentence id="6501">And we've tried unsuccessfully to recruit some others, because they don't...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6517">Q: You're talking about African-Americans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6519">A: Yeah, African-American lawyers, and paralegals.</sentence><sentence id="6520">You have to have a support system as a minority person to live, I think, wherever you are.</sentence><sentence id="6521">It's difficult to be alone.</sentence><sentence id="6522">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hazard</span> we have a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to which Cynthia from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jackson</span> belongs.</sentence><sentence id="6523">And there are some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">black communities</span> that are concentrated in our <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6524">So the few people who have looked, that have really taken a little look at it, I think were, very cautious about, or were not convinced they could feel comfortable living here.</sentence><sentence id="6525">We do have a black secretary in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barbourville</span> and one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harlan</span> and we have a paralegal in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span> having a fairly much larger African-American community.</sentence><sentence id="6526">But the population is about ninety-eight percent white in our thirty-seven <span class="REGION">counties</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6527">But I think the point I wanted to make was that we do, <span class="BUILDING">legal services offices</span> are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> where our clients are and so you are much more associated and you are a part of that community.</sentence><sentence id="6528">I think we're a lot closer to our clients and you get to know your clients.</sentence><sentence id="6529">And you get to see the problems and live with the problems from day to day.</sentence><sentence id="6530">Not to say that all of us are poor, but I think after your kids, especially when your children get into the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, you begin to feel that you have much more of a stake in trying to develop, do something about that community.</sentence><sentence id="6531">You find other parents who really want the best thing for their children, even though it may be what we're doing in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> is not always popular.</sentence><sentence id="6532">Maybe our value systems are not on the same track as the other lawyers who for a large part are driven by the money they are going to make in private practice.</sentence><sentence id="6533">They do some good things in private practice along the way, but generally in the social structure people are driven by money.</sentence><sentence id="6534">So, I feel that the work we do, we represent about 7,000 clients a year and much of the work we do, whether for each of those clients, the case we help them on is the most important thing in the world, whether you've got to talk about an abused spouse or someone who's about to be evicted from an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or someone who we're helping with social security benefits or something small, or whether we're involved in some major issue involving the Broad Form Deed or safety discrimination, the cases that tend to get the headlines.</sentence><sentence id="6535">Or working on black lung, working on trying to help make black lung regulations more responsive, little more liberal, where more than five percent of the claims are approved.</sentence><sentence id="6536">Or something like David.</sentence><sentence id="6537">Each of those are a real, I think, positive contribution to helping people lead better lives and making the society a more just one.</sentence><sentence id="6538">So, I think it's, you asked me a while ago did I think we were going to be here thirty years when I came and I said I thought we'd be here maybe two or three years.</sentence><sentence id="6539">But I think the work has been so challenging and the opportunity to do this work has been a real privilege, that I always say we're fortunate at least to be paid for doing something we want to do.</sentence><sentence id="6540">And the government, state and federal governments are willing to provide funds to do it.</sentence><sentence id="6541">I think the newer, our younger lawyers give up a great deal to work for us, because they are working at very low salaries and many of them have large loan re-payments.</sentence><sentence id="6542">They start at 25,000 dollars a year and some of them have really huge debts of 80-90,000 dollars to their <span class="BUILDING">law schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6543">We have a small loan re-payment program <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 87 now that helps them, up to 2,000 dollars a year.</sentence><sentence id="6544">But they're the ones in a way who are, I think, making a substantial sacrifice to work.</sentence><sentence id="6545">I mean you'd hope that the government, we can do better than that.</sentence><sentence id="6546">That eventually we could work out, and develop more programs that would encourage people to spend their lives in this sort of work.</sentence><sentence id="6547">But I think it's been so, in part satisfying and challenging and all those adjectives, that I've enjoyed it.</sentence><sentence id="6548">I probably, there may have been times that Jean might have wondered whether we wouldn't be better off going for a better educational system for our kids.</sentence><sentence id="6549">Michael was academically very gifted and sort of ahead of the pack.</sentence><sentence id="6550">And we had our difficult times, early times with... one of the teachers asked him to explain Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday one day, and when

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6603">A: I remember the teacher virtually threatened him because he couldn't keep the crayons within the <span class="DLF">lines</span>, which is still a problem for some children.</sentence><sentence id="6604">I mean she was more concerned about his drawing, keeping the crayons in the <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6605">And what, how that would, then realizing how, what a negative reaction this could have on a child, who was basically an academically-gifted young boy.</sentence><sentence id="6606">But you know, those were... the teacher eventually left, and we, I think we were fortunate that we had some teachers who saw how bright he was and that he began, that he was able to get the best for himself, was able to do quite well.</sentence><sentence id="6607">And we had a principal who wanted, who was very interested in the best, in providing good education for mountain kids, and who encouraged Jean to help start a Gifted and Talented program in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6608">And he never, there wasn't a single swing on the <span class="DLF">yard</span> when we first came there.</sentence><sentence id="6609">And so we put together a little committee and gradually got a coal company to do some grading and developed a wonderful <span class="DLF">playground</span> with the PTA, on the <span class="DLF">school grounds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6610">And that he just, his name was John Pitts.</sentence><sentence id="6611">He couldn't figure out where he wanted to put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swings</span>, so he hadn't put them anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="6612">But he just needed some help.</sentence><sentence id="6613">And you know, and I think as people realize that what you want is the same thing they want.</sentence><sentence id="6614">That what you're trying to do is really not a turnover, turn everything upside down, that we're filing law suits every time... but what we're trying to do is help the community and be good citizens.</sentence><sentence id="6615">Then you begin to feel that people are on your side, even if the few lawyers aren't, and that we have a lot of support in this community.</sentence><sentence id="6616">And I remember in our PTA when the movement first started to put the Ten Commandments up on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span>, which is something that's come back today again.</sentence><sentence id="6617">I don't know if you've seen the paper, the Harlan County Board of Education voted to put the Ten Commandments on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, even though it's against the law and the Supreme Court has said you cannot do that.</sentence><sentence id="6618">We had a discussion in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">PTA</span>, a very thoughtful discussion.</sentence><sentence id="6619">And we had, there was, we had at least one family of Indians, not Native Americans, but from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6620">A surgeon, whose daughter was in Michael's class.</sentence><sentence id="6621">And, you know, there were people, initially the reaction is what's wrong with the Ten Commandments?</sentence><sentence id="6622">They're perfectly good commandments.</sentence><sentence id="6623">And you know, I could say, "Well, they're the foundation of our faith as Jews, but they may not be the foundation of our Indian friends, and religions differ.</sentence><sentence id="6624">And I would be the last person to say there's anything wrong with the Ten Commandments, but they don't belong on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> right now."</sentence><sentence id="6625">And the attorney... at the time, they were waiting for the Attorney General to come out for an opinion.</sentence><sentence id="6626">So, the resolution at that meeting was to wait until the Attorney General came out with an opinion.</sentence><sentence id="6627">And people were quite comfortable with that.</sentence><sentence id="6628">I'm sure that if we hadn't been there, and I mean the point was... that was let's see, twenty years ago, that people accepted what we had to say, and were respectful of what we had to say, and were willing to wait.</sentence><sentence id="6629">And that wouldn't be always the case, I think, where you had folks who are very strong in their... and I'm sure some of those people are, were members of fairly doctrinaire, Baptist and... <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, but they were willing to say, "We'll wait."</sentence><sentence id="6630">And I think those things always give you some hope, I mean give you cause for feeling good about, being proud of the people you are with.</sentence><sentence id="6631">I mean I'm not always proud of everything everybody does, and you always wonder, but... So I think as we, both Jean and I, got involved in a lot of educational advocacy work, that we sort of knew we were here.</sentence><sentence id="6632">Then when our daughter, Annie, did not do well academically as she got into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and had a lot more... she is a very social person and was friends with people who were 88</sentence><sentence id="6634">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 89 very, very poor and friends with people who were quite rich.</sentence><sentence id="6635">And she had a lot of kids who were friends who were on the fringy group.</sentence><sentence id="6636">And she was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and was not doing well.</sentence><sentence id="6637">So anyway, she went to the <span class="BUILDING">David School</span>, which didn't have many girls at the time and they were able to take her.</sentence><sentence id="6638">She hadn't dropped out.</sentence><sentence id="6639">She did really well there and thought the <span class="BUILDING">David School</span> was a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> because of the one on one.</sentence><sentence id="6640">And she had a very good math teacher who helped her with her math.</sentence><sentence id="6641">We got her back on the right track, academically.</sentence><sentence id="6642">But it was very hard for me to take her... I mean I felt, I really wanted to stick with the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, public education.</sentence><sentence id="6643">But they were losing her, and she was a good example of a student who should have stayed, who had, at least then, average academic skills, but was just an example of someone that fell between the cracks because the teachers were not paying attention.</sentence><sentence id="6644">Which is something, I think, we've changed.</sentence><sentence id="6645">And I think that we've always continued to be involved in these kind of efforts to try to help out our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and make this <span class="REGION">region</span> a better <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6646">And I think that education has a lot to do with that.</sentence><sentence id="6647">And I think we see in my work here in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, we do a lot of work, we represent parents of kids who have special needs and the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> tend to, they don't want to bother with them so often, unless you have a very committed teacher, who's going to work with students like that.</sentence><sentence id="6648">It's much easier to move them out of the way.</sentence><sentence id="6649">So when we, I think a lot of the cases we've done, the consumer cases, all the cases I've made reference to, the black lung work, where it's hard for, the organization wouldn't have anyone to assist them in these very technical fields without spending a great deal of money.</sentence><sentence id="6650">Helping them to write regulations that will benefit them.</sentence><sentence id="6651">All these things have been really a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to work and for the lawyers who worked in this program.</sentence><sentence id="6652">I mean I think people who work in legal services across the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> who devote their lives or their careers to serving the poor, are a wonderful group, I have a lot of admiration for them.</sentence><sentence id="6653">So it's always nice for me to come to work every day, because it's such a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Annie probably went to more <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, was, went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> more, because she spent more weekends with friends who went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, some of whom are more evangelical than others.</sentence><sentence id="6733">We have been invited to many <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6734">And we have gone to, more to the <span class="BUILDING">Presbyterian 89</span></sentence><sentence id="6736">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 90 <span class="BUILDING">church</span> than others because, probably the Catholics and the Presbyterians have run more programs for poor people.</sentence><sentence id="6737">And in this <span class="REGION">area</span> over time, St. Vincent's Mission came in here.</sentence><sentence id="6738">Or maybe not the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> as such, but the ministry.</sentence><sentence id="6739">They brought more, while they are also attempting to increase the number of Catholics in their ranks, I think their message of being socially concerned has been stronger than that of the other faiths, even though they are a minority.</sentence><sentence id="6740">The <span class="BUILDING">Presbyterian church</span> was always very active with its Christian Service ministry.</sentence><sentence id="6741">And it's not as fundamental as the <span class="BUILDING">Baptist church</span> and some of their beliefs with respect to Jesus.</sentence><sentence id="6742">So when Jean, as I said from the beginning was working with the Meals on Wheels program and a number of their related programs in this Christian Service ministry, we've gone there many times.</sentence><sentence id="6743">But there's never been any real, I mean we've known all of their ministers.</sentence><sentence id="6744">In recent years there's been a much more sharing between rabbis and ministers.</sentence><sentence id="6745">Now here, the Ministerial Association, they had a Catholic priest that was here when we first came, named Father... oh gosh, what's his name?</sentence><sentence id="6746">Getting a little tired.</sentence><sentence id="6747">Young Catholic priest was here.</sentence><sentence id="6748">It will come to me ina moment.</sentence><sentence id="6749">And they wouldn't let him in, wouldn't let him in the Ministerial Association.</sentence><sentence id="6750">He'd tend to wear moccasins around and wear blue jeans and was always a little bit out front on some of the social issues, working with welfare folks, and asking people about this being the way Jesus would have it.</sentence><sentence id="6751">He finally, I think, five or six years later, put a Christmas card in the paper, wishing all of his ministers well at Christmas, hoping they would have a nice Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="6752">He guilt-tripped them into it.</sentence><sentence id="6753">They finally let him in.</sentence><sentence id="6754">But there was that kind of thing, but there's never really been, I don't know, people have always been very nice to us maybe because, more about who we are than what the religion is.</sentence><sentence id="6755">I'm sure they would welcome our, many of the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> would have welcomed the conversions.</sentence><sentence id="6756">Or the fundamental religion, especially.</sentence><sentence id="6757">We've been to many <span class="BUILDING">funerals</span>, I mean, when you get to these, especially when you go to a funeral where they preach over, about salvation and that you simply, you know, you're doomed if you're not saved.</sentence><sentence id="6758">And they're looking at you.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6799">A: Yeah, well we, while the kids were, we sort of maintain the Jewish tradition, Friday nights, Saturday, not every Friday night, but especially when everybody is together.</sentence><sentence id="6800">And we go to <span class="BUILDING">services</span> now more regularly since we go to <span class="REGION">Williamson West Virginia</span>, for the Jewish services.</sentence><sentence id="6801">They are on Sunday night, as I mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="6802">It's a rabbi comes down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Huntington</span>, so he has a Friday night service on a Sunday night.</sentence><sentence id="6803">The Quakers meet monthly in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6804">And of course you can have a Quaker meeting whether you have three people or three thousand, because they are silent meetings for worship.</sentence><sentence id="6805">And people get up and say something during the silence, if they are led to say something.</sentence><sentence id="6806">And it may go on for half an hour, it may go the whole hour and nobody says anything.</sentence><sentence id="6807">Or it maybe that someone has a comment that is on their mind and many people speak.</sentence><sentence id="6808">In the more organized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> in the East, you have this group of overseers.</sentence><sentence id="6809">I mean the meeting has to have an administration with dues and <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> and all of that.</sentence><sentence id="6810">But this is a very informal group.</sentence><sentence id="6811">There is an annual meeting of Quakers in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> which we haven't been to in a while.</sentence><sentence id="6812">But the participants here are generally a couple in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hazard</span> and a woman who teaches at the Pine Mountain Settlement School and a woman who is a doctor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hyden</span>, who is in her seventies and has been there for maybe twenty-five or thirty years, I guess, who's a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="6813">But he was a doctor and she's a Quaker, very interesting person, 90</sentence><sentence id="6815"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 91 who lives up a holler in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hyden</span> in a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with... all these hundreds of goldfinches that are usually there.</sentence><sentence id="6816">A very nice <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6817">And then there have been some Mennonite volunteers, who have come to Quaker meeting during their volunteer period.</sentence><sentence id="6818">So the group is a little bit fluid, although there is this permanent group, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="6819">The couple in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hazard</span> work for the rural health system and they've been there for several years.</sentence><sentence id="6820">So they meet once a month and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> a few weeks ago.</sentence><sentence id="6821">The next time will be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hazard</span> or at the Pine Mountain Settlement School.</sentence><sentence id="6822">That woman is in her seventies, also.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6851">A: And I always go.</sentence><sentence id="6852">I'ma very big fan of Quakerism.</sentence><sentence id="6853">I mean I would not, not to convert.</sentence><sentence id="6854">It is a very tolerant religion, built on faith, and the light that shines on everyone.</sentence><sentence id="6855">And I don't know that there's a great enormous amount of difference, except that it's built on the teachings of Jesus, essentially.</sentence><sentence id="6856">But they don't dwell on salvation and the other parts of it.</sentence><sentence id="6857">I think they really dwell on living your life out in a full life and serving others, and the principles of humanity that I share and that I feel good about.</sentence><sentence id="6858">So I think it's been pretty easy for us to adapt to each other.</sentence><sentence id="6859">I've probably spent more time now with the Quaker part of it.</sentence><sentence id="6860">I really haven't studied Quakerism that carefully.</sentence><sentence id="6861">I've read a lot of books and probably will some time, as I should read about Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="6862">And I haven't done as much of that also, a little here and a little there.</sentence><sentence id="6863">But I'd like to that a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="6864">I've got plenty of other things I also want to read.</sentence><sentence id="6865">Right?</sentence><sentence id="6866">Like you do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6883">Q: And how did you raise your kids?</sentence><sentence id="6884">Were they involved in both <span class="BUILDING">religions</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6887">A: They were involved in both, although as I said, Michael, we didn't have Quaker meetings back then.</sentence><sentence id="6888">We had some of the state gatherings.</sentence><sentence id="6889">This group is a relatively recent phenomenon of the last three or four years.</sentence><sentence id="6890">It was really sparked by the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hazard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6891">And we didn't go initially.</sentence><sentence id="6892">We were when Michael, I guess in our earlier years, we pretty much went to services in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashland</span> and took Michael when he was little, and Annie.</sentence><sentence id="6893">They were the only children their age at that time.</sentence><sentence id="6894">And we would go fairly regularly, but we always went during the Jewish holidays.</sentence><sentence id="6895">And the Quaker tradition doesn't have a lot of formal ceremony with it as Judaism does around these holidays.</sentence><sentence id="6896">So we would celebrate those and we would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6897">We had Passover Seders at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which Jean and maybe the others would, she did the cooking and became fairly well-versed in what's involved.</sentence><sentence id="6898">Did some reading and embarrassingly probably knows more about some of those traditions now than I do.</sentence><sentence id="6899">But that's the way the kids were raised.</sentence><sentence id="6900">And Michael, as I told you, I spent more time with Michael probably talking about, doing sort of a light Sunday school lesson every Sunday for several years.</sentence><sentence id="6901">That was part of our tradition at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6902">I didn't do that with Ann Louise for, I'm not sure exactly why.</sentence><sentence id="6903">I think... who knows why?</sentence><sentence id="6904">But I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="6905">More recently she has become much more interested in both.</sentence><sentence id="6906">I think she was, as Jean was relating to you, very concerned about the Nazis, the history, the danger that it posed and still is worried about some goofy Klansperson coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and doing something.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7012">A: Tape eight?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7014">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="7015">So, going back, we were just talking a little bit off tape about some of your, about some of your speaking experiences and things that you've brought up or drawn upon when you've gone to commencement addresses and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="7016">And one of the things that you mentioned was the last case that you had before you left the Justice Department which had to do with the <span class="BUILDING">Kent State University</span> violence.</sentence><sentence id="7017">Can you talk about your role in that and your point of view about what happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7022">A: Well, I mean my role was, at the time was as Chief of the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division.</sentence><sentence id="7023">Because this involved the National Guard and potentially other police officials, state officials, the Justice Department is called in to investigate.</sentence><sentence id="7024">Potentially there is a federal crime when police officials act illegally or summarily and what we call summary punishment by not arresting, for example, students who do something wrong, but rather they overreact and shoot or punish or beat whoever the victim might be.</sentence><sentence id="7025">So, when this happened, this incident happened and was called to our attention, my job was to write a request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate, to see whether a violation of federal law had occurred.</sentence><sentence id="7026">And so, that being May of--how many years ago?--1970, thirty years ago, I drafted that request, which then was sent out under the name of the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, who I believe at the time was Jerry Leonard.</sentence><sentence id="7027">And I'm sure I'd have to go dig it out or I don't even know if I have a copy of it, you know, it would be fairly thorough about where they would be interviewing any witnesses who were there and whether they, the police officials in fact were threatened or there was any reason that would justify their having used force in shooting those students who were killed.</sentence><sentence id="7028">There was a long grand jury convened after I left.</sentence><sentence id="7029">As I recall it was actually inconclusive.</sentence><sentence id="7030">I think there was no federal trial.</sentence><sentence id="7031">I think there were civil trials later which I'm not sure, it seemed to me they may have recovered some damages for the families of the children, of the students who had been killed.</sentence><sentence id="7032">It was just a very tragic event.</sentence><sentence id="7033">There were others at the time.</sentence><sentence id="7034">I recall, I think when we were speaking, I had seen an article recently before I gave the commencement address here at <span class="BUILDING">Prestonsburg Community College</span>, which happened to have been written by the President of <span class="BUILDING">Kent State University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7035">It was sort of a memorial column or just recalling those tragic events and the fact that they were in the memory of the President and people who were at <span class="BUILDING">Kent State</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="7036">And that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself had made great progress in the intervening years and that this awful event was a milestone, obviously, in the history of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which sort of marred its reputation, along with... or which they felt marred its reputation.</sentence><sentence id="7037">It was not forgotten, but that since then the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had progressed and had moved into the age of technology and that she was very proud of their progress.</sentence><sentence id="7038">And I happened to be particularly moved by the way that she ended the column, which was that in this age of technology, it was important not to lose our humanity.</sentence><sentence id="7039">And so I was, used her, some of her quotations in concluding this address that I gave to the local students.</sentence><sentence id="7040">And it reminded me that it was also sort of one of the last things we did, that I did at the Justice Department, before we left on our vacation, but really left.</sentence><sentence id="7041">And then were headed for <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7042">93</sentence><sentence id="7044"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 94</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7068">Q: So you just filed the case, but you didn't investigate it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7070">A: Well, I didn't, no.</sentence><sentence id="7071">My job basically, if... had I stayed, the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, the lawyers who worked with me and for me as Chief of the Criminal Section... after, the way those things would work is that when the FBI goes through its investigation and prepares a report, those are usually turned over to the United States Attorney for prosecution or for determination of whether a crime has been committed.</sentence><sentence id="7072">And generally then if there is some conflict, in other words when the officers say, "I thought that it looked like the student had a gun and that we had to shoot the student or we would have been killed," those factual disputes, someone has to resolve them by generally going to a grand jury, which is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="7073">And then either the U.S. Attorney co-operatively with lawyers from the Civil Rights Division, or... would make that presentation, but we left.</sentence><sentence id="7074">That was at the point after I had authored and drafted this report, this request, was when we left.</sentence><sentence id="7075">And so the investigation really went on and I believe one of my colleagues, Jim Turner, who was sort of one notch up in the hierarchy as a Deputy Attorney General(r), was sent out there and that he spent several months, along with reviewing the reports and working with the grand jury and then determining whether someone should be indicted or not.</sentence><sentence id="7076">I want to think that there was never, that there were no federal indictments, but I may be wrong.</sentence><sentence id="7077">It seems to me that was one of the sad things, that this was one of those, one of those sort of inconclusive... there were, on the face of it you would think that there was no reason to shoot students, because they were certainly not armed.</sentence><sentence id="7078">And that they got caught in the, were victims of what happened.</sentence><sentence id="7079">But I'm not sure that anyone was actually ever accused of having, of criminally having done this.</sentence><sentence id="7080">That there was some evidence in the heat of the moment that these folks felt threatened, their lives were threatened.</sentence><sentence id="7081">And that they, while they may have been negligent or they may have, whatever they did, that there was enough justification to make them question, that they made a bad decision, but it wasn't, certainly wasn't intentional on their part.</sentence><sentence id="7082">And that it may have been enough to warrant civil proceedings.</sentence><sentence id="7083">But that's the way those things always, you know, went.</sentence><sentence id="7084">And so in other circumstances, like when I was in the Houston case, we also asked the FBI to investigate and to assist us in determining, looking at records and other <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7085">And then the lawyer who is responsible for the case, as I was in the Houston case with other lawyers working with me and were working under my direction, then I would present the case to the judge.</sentence><sentence id="7086">That's how those things work.</sentence><sentence id="7087">We're done.</sentence><sentence id="7088">I didn't do any more in Kent State.</sentence><sentence id="7089">I mean that was, most of that then happened after I left.</sentence><sentence id="7090">So it was a memory and this article that I happened to see in the newspaper sort of jogged my mind back.</sentence><sentence id="7091">It's sort of the punctuation mark.</sentence><sentence id="7092">It's the point at which we left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7116">Q: I wonder also if you had, at the time if you felt, you had mentioned in the earlier sessions of this interview how much you idealized this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and its constitution and the principles on which it was founded, and that you really held, had high expectations of it.</sentence><sentence id="7117">During the Vietnam War did you feel disillusioned with this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and its government?</sentence><sentence id="7118">Or did that change your perspective at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7122">A: Well, I mean, I think there are lots of times when you wish political decisions were made, were different.</sentence><sentence id="7123">I mean I think that everyone is, that a lot of people are sad about our involvement in the Vietnam War.</sentence><sentence id="7124">I was in the war, served during the time of <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7125">It was obviously... and as I probably said before, there were lots of reasons I enjoyed the time I spent in the Service.</sentence><sentence id="7126">We <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 95 made a lot of very close friends, who I continue to see and hear from, and get together with periodically.</sentence><sentence id="7127">And I think you feel that you are doing something worthwhile when you're in the Service.</sentence><sentence id="7128">And helping this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in a small way.</sentence><sentence id="7129">But that I also noted that when, during the Suez Canal Crisis, when we were on alert for a week and no one was quite certain which <span class="NPIP">side</span> we were on, and that because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> hadn't made up its mind which <span class="NPIP">side</span> we were on, and <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was one of the partners, was one of the main parties involved in that dispute, the thought that we would be in a conflict with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was not very appealing to me, but that it just let me know how much of a, that this was not what I wanted to do (laughing), to be regimented in that way.</sentence><sentence id="7130">So that staying in the Service was not anything that I wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="7131">On the other hand, I always, I think that it's a very dangerous occupation.</sentence><sentence id="7132">And I feel those people who are in the Military for a career, who really believe that this is an important thing to do, often that we owe a lot to people who have been, who have served in our Military, and who have either given their lives or come back wounded or who are veterans.</sentence><sentence id="7133">And I'm sure now we much, recognize much more the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span>, who may not have won a war, were nevertheless there because they were doing what they were told to do.</sentence><sentence id="7134">And of course a lot of people were willing, were Conscientious Objectors and didn't go.</sentence><sentence id="7135">My personal feeling is if someone's a Conscientious Objector they ought not to go.</sentence><sentence id="7136">And we ought to let them not go.</sentence><sentence id="7137">There are plenty of people who want to go or who were willing to go or there were and there were things that could be done.</sentence><sentence id="7138">So, I don't know that I, I'm not disillusioned.</sentence><sentence id="7139">I'm still very much a, feel very strongly that, I guess maybe it's a little rhetoric, but I feel that this is still the best <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in many, many ways in the world.</sentence><sentence id="7140">There are a lot of imperfections with it, that we... and some of the issues that we have to resolve are very difficult issues.</sentence><sentence id="7141">When we see in this <span class="REGION">area</span> the economy being as poor as it is.</sentence><sentence id="7142">We've lost a lot of jobs here.</sentence><sentence id="7143">Trying to catch up.</sentence><sentence id="7144">What I spoke about at <span class="BUILDING">PCC</span>, of course, that, that the Kent State thing related to, I asked, I emphasized to the students how much they should be grateful for being in this free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7145">It was also the, the week of the graduation was also the week of Law Day, in which we celebrate our freedom and the Constitution under which we live.</sentence><sentence id="7146">And it was also the anniversary of Holocaust Remembrance Day.</sentence><sentence id="7147">And it was the anniversary, the thirty year anniversary of Kent State.</sentence><sentence id="7148">And I think all of those are messages that we need to remember and reflect upon.</sentence><sentence id="7149">I think we do have a legal system that really is the basis for the freedom that we have.</sentence><sentence id="7150">And a lot of those freedoms are at times tenuous.</sentence><sentence id="7151">You worry when the Klan, you wish we did not have the Klan around, but the fact that we allow them to exist under, in a restricted way still is part of the freedom that we can enjoy.</sentence><sentence id="7152">And I think all of those kinds of issues sort of tumble around together.</sentence><sentence id="7153">And yet we, we have

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7217">A: Well, I think that the black <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, the name right now escapes me, probably shouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="7218">The hundredth anniversary was an event they'd worked on, was quite a significant event for the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7219">There are two <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wheelwright</span>, <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> and this is one of them.</sentence><sentence id="7220">And they had been planning this anniversary for some time and have had a series of ministers over the years and it's a very cohesive community.</sentence><sentence id="7221">And I think, probably, one of the reasons they asked me to speak was because they related, they knew that I was Jewish and that I had been involved as a legal services lawyer and perhaps as a Justice Department lawyer in some civil rights issues over time.</sentence><sentence id="7222">But also that I was a, that my family had escaped from the Holocaust and they knew some of that history.</sentence><sentence id="7223">And I think they analogized it in their own way to the discrimination that they had felt and that they wanted me maybe to reflect upon the f act that there were people who were white and who were discriminated against because they were Jewish or for reasons other than race.</sentence><sentence id="7224">But that someone, a family lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> that had shared some of that history that their own families and ancestors had experienced over their lifetime.</sentence><sentence id="7225">I know that, I think in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, I think that the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> now have made the Holocaust a very much a part of their curriculum.</sentence><sentence id="7226">When I go, I've spoken to <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> students and <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students.</sentence><sentence id="7227">And when I ask how many of them know who Ann Frank was or whether they have done a unit on Ann Frank, almost every hand goes up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7228">I think that unit is probably done in the fifth and sixth grade and in the seventh grade.</sentence><sentence id="7229">And that, but the fact, I think teachers tell me, the fact that they see someone who is alive and who can come into their <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and say this is what happened to my family.</sentence><sentence id="7230">I was eight years old when they arrested my father and took him to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7231">Or I was standing in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> when they were dynamiting the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7232">That is always more, it makes a stronger point than having heard it from a third person.</sentence><sentence id="7233">And if it's someone in their own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> that I suppose has been identified as having some credibility, that doesn't just make these stories up.</sentence><sentence id="7234">I think when you, you always tend to put some faith and trust in people that have lived with you a long time, who are part of the community.</sentence><sentence id="7235">It's kind of like any other, listening to older, someone described the history of the <span class="BUILDING">May house</span> or the May family or their own family history.</sentence><sentence id="7236">When they've grown up here it means more.</sentence><sentence id="7237">At least I think that's, whenever you find someone, whether it's the war, my neighbor used to, my neighbor must have been on every <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7238">He died a few years ago, but he was one of those Appalachian soldiers who was drafted and lived through every beach assault in the Pacific.</sentence><sentence id="7239">And even if he tells it in a low key sort of conversational way, it's very powerful to talk to someone who lived it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

I mean some of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> groups, when we first came Jean was... we were involved with the <span class="BUILDING">Presbyterian church</span> a good bit because they did a lot of social, were more involved in local social projects.</sentence><sentence id="7279">They started Meals on Wheels and Christian Service Ministry that she was involved with.</sentence><sentence id="7280">And so the ministers who knew that we were involved, had Passovers and that I was Jewish and some of that developed into, people, by word of mouth realized that I wasn't born in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and that I did have this experience.</sentence><sentence id="7281">But it wasn't, I guess in more recent years, I've had more, probably as people learned and as I spoke more about the Holocaust and about being Jewish, that there have been more, there's been a bit more of an awareness about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="7282">I think partly because of the Holocaust Memorial and there's been more publicity generally about the importance of this whole era and trying to make people remember it and not let it be forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="7283">That all probably is part of the reason why this has come up.</sentence><sentence id="7284">And I think that tying it into Law Day is something that has gotten around among the teachers, that that's something I'm willing to speak about or can speak about on Law Day, that may be more meaningful to students than just talking about the Constitution or how the legal system works, which is the other thing that we generally do when we go to the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7285">Well, I don't have any doubt that the history, that our fleeing from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and being grateful for the opportunity to be free here, has sort of moved me into public service work.</sentence><sentence id="7286">I think that's pretty clear.</sentence><sentence id="7287">When I was in the military, I think it probably in a way helped move me to go to the Service as well.</sentence><sentence id="7288">I don't know that I went into the ROTC, which helped partly also with tuition.</sentence><sentence id="7289">Back then it was one of the ways of making <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duke</span> affordable, which was an expensive <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7290">But I mean, whether it's just the rationalization or the reason, | think I certainly felt that being in the Service was one way of trying to help fulfill my, help me give something back.</sentence><sentence id="7291">You can stay out of the Service.</sentence><sentence id="7292">I'm sure I didn't have to do that.</sentence><sentence id="7293">But that was during a time that people also were being drafted.</sentence><sentence id="7294">And that if you didn't want to be an enlisted man and wanted to do more with your career in the Service...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7371">A: Well, I talk about the contrast between a society that we have in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, where we have a government and a nation, which is governed by the rule of law and what happened in Fascist Germany where the legal system was basically put aside for a dictatorship.</sentence><sentence id="7372">And that the kinds of things that were able to happen in the Holocaust, which was a result of Hitler's fanaticism.</sentence><sentence id="7373">And what did happen in that dictatorship, and how, again, grateful we need to be and how they, students, can reflect on or ought to reflect, and their teachers and all of this ought to reflect on the system we have in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, which would not, hopefully, permit anything like that to happen.</sentence><sentence id="7374">That the checks and balances in the legislative, executive and judicial systems would keep that from happening.</sentence><sentence id="7375">And that we have, that free speech is important and that all of the guarantees that we have under the Constitution and under the Bill of Rights are very meaningful and that it's important to talk about them.</sentence><sentence id="7376">So I use, I guess the family's personal experiences, and I talk a little bit about the history of how all this came about in the 1930s from Hitler's rise to power.</sentence><sentence id="7377">How during the war, I mean even afterwards, how people would like to pretend in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that no one knew about it and this all sort of just happened and people are looking the other way.</sentence><sentence id="7378">At least were looking the other way and most, I suspect, did know about what was going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Death camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7379">That's what I try to focus on and I think the teachers seem to appreciate that and seem to feel that it's a good way to have their students appreciate Law Day.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7393">A: Well, I don't remember what I said at the time, but the important tenet, I guess, of Judaism is the emphasis on justice, study and justice.</sentence><sentence id="7394">That the Ten Commandments and having a society where being just to each other and where you have a governing, legal codes that govern Judaism, which are principles of living really.</sentence><sentence id="7395">The major ones.</sentence><sentence id="7396">I might have said that those principles probably helped to influence me and the work that Ido.</sentence><sentence id="7397">I remember when we were just talking about Law Day, usually when I begin a talk, I talk a little bit about the fact that we've been, who we are and who I am, that I'm here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7398">We've lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Floyd County</span> all these years.</sentence><sentence id="7399">And talk a little about our <span class="BUILDING">legal services agency</span> and try to describe that we do have a system in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that provides lawyers for people who can't afford lawyers, on the criminal and on the <span class="REGION">civil side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7400">And that what this program, what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appalred</span> and other civil legal services programs do and how difficult it is.</sentence><sentence id="7401">Many times it is basically impossible to navigate through the legal system without having a lawyer to help you, so that poor people are often on the short end of business transactions and many other people lose rights.</sentence><sentence id="7402">They lose benefits to which they are entitled.</sentence><sentence id="7403">And the kind of work that defenses in eviction cases, consumer cases, all the work that we have done.</sentence><sentence id="7404">The Broad Form, environmental work.</sentence><sentence id="7405">So I try to also mention that.</sentence><sentence id="7406">So, going back to what you were asking me, I don't know that it's any easier...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7880">A: Not, it only comes, it comes up, well, my friend Ned Pillersdorf, who is a practicing lawyer here, teaches a class on the court system, on I think, civil liberties and the law.</sentence><sentence id="7881">And he generally has speakers come in, other judges and I usually come in for a night with him.</sentence><sentence id="7882">And I've spoken a few other times, but really not very much.</sentence><sentence id="7883">And I'm not sure that that many people are aware of what I did.</sentence><sentence id="7884">I mean I don't particularly publicize it.</sentence><sentence id="7885">If I'm giving a speech and somebody's writing some background about my legal history, they'll generally mention that.</sentence><sentence id="7886">But I don't really do much speaking about it.</sentence><sentence id="7887">Usually the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> have a unit on it.</sentence><sentence id="7888">There's a lot of, certainly a lot of written materials and most of those... Taylor Branch's books quote my boss, there's a lot in Taylor's books about John Doar(tm).</sentence><sentence id="7889">And usually when books are written like that, that's who they are going to write about.</sentence><sentence id="7890">I don't know that I'm anybody necessarily.</sentence><sentence id="7891">But locally if people ask, I will talk about the cases.</sentence><sentence id="7892">I mean I've spoken a few times, not recently about the legal developments of these, of how we put these cases together and the Voting Rights Act and the impact of the Voting Rights Act.</sentence><sentence id="7893">But then I left in 1970 and I've been doing this legal services work for thirty years.</sentence><sentence id="7894">And unless those things come together somewhere, it's become part of my, sort of distant past, except for reunions of Civil Rights Division lawyers and some of the ongoing contacts I've had with people.</sentence><sentence id="7895">So not really very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7924">A: Well, I think probably what I had reference to was after Richard Nixon was elected and William Mitchell became Attorney General(r), they did not want to continue to seek bussing of students as a remedy to undo segregation.</sentence><sentence id="7925">And <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlotte</span> had accepted a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span> remedy and several other <span class="COUNTRY">states</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="7926">The problem is when you have a segregated community, so that white students, black students are, if you don't use something like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span>, you can't achieve very much integration, unless you pair up <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> where the two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">housing districts</span> happen to be close.</sentence><sentence id="7927">Where they call that pairing of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7928">You could pair <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that are in nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7929">But the Nixon administration, so the Nixon administration really backed, not only on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span>, but they generally felt, I think, that the position of the Department in the past had been too strong towards moving towards integrating <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7930">And they were more inclined towards free choice, which would essentially leave student... the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> white and black, with some very few exceptions.</sentence><sentence id="7931">And the Houston case was filed right after the Nixons came in and we did ask for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span> as a remedy.</sentence><sentence id="7932">And it was the last case that they allowed that to go through.</sentence><sentence id="7933">In fact, the Assistant Attorney General, who was probably called on the carpet about it a little bit, because it had gone to him and he had approved it.</sentence><sentence id="7934">And I don't know that he was brand new, whether he really focused on it as much as he might have.</sentence><sentence id="7935">But the Attorney General had to, I think had to sign it as well.</sentence><sentence id="7936">We went forward in that case.</sentence><sentence id="7937">It was a very large case.</sentence><sentence id="7938"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> was the third-largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">school district</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7939">I can't remember, a couple of hundred <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7940">They had, what they had done is spent millions and millions of dollars building new <span class="BUILDING">suburban schools</span> outside, on the outer fringes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7941">At the same time they let the inner-city schools decay, so it was really doubly bad.</sentence><sentence id="7942">It wasn't just, in some <span class="BUILDING">school districts</span> they tried to upgrade black <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to prevent desegregation.</sentence><sentence id="7943">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> they didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="7944">They spent all their money on white <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and let the black <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> get worse.</sentence><sentence id="7945">So, but then at the same time they bussed white kids past <span class="BUILDING">black schools</span> and blacks past white <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7946">So we asked for, I had an expert from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span>, Florida, who was an expert in school desegregation matters.</sentence><sentence id="7947">What a minute, maybe he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span>, <span class="REGION">Texas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7948">Mike Stolee.</sentence><sentence id="7949">I guess he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7950">Well, one or the other.</sentence><sentence id="7951">And he testified as to the need to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and that using <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span> as a remedy would produce a, basically an integrated school system, with all the advantages that might come, or that could come with that.</sentence><sentence id="7952">There was much more to it in the case than that, but basically that was it.</sentence><sentence id="7953">The other phenomenon at the time was that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicano community</span> was just developing, so that it was like we had three donuts.</sentence><sentence id="7954">You had a core of inner-city black schools, then you had a small, growing donut around it of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicano communities</span> and then you had all the whites on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7955">But racially, Chicanos were treated as whites at that time, and probably still are.</sentence><sentence id="7956">There's a designation for themselves, but we were trying to desegregate a <span class="BUILDING">school district</span> that had traditionally been black and white.</sentence><sentence id="7957">And so one of the things that the judge in the case did, was pair up some white <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> with <span class="BUILDING">Chicano schools</span>, which I wasn't particularly happy about.</sentence><sentence id="7958">I mean I don't know that we had achieved very much, as we had hoped to do.</sentence><sentence id="7959">There were some other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7960">We didn't get a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bussing</span>, but we got, the Board was required to spend massive amounts of money to get, to upgrade <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7961">And the other, probably the best thing that happened was they threw out the School Board.</sentence><sentence id="7962">They voted in a new School Board that was much more moderate.</sentence><sentence id="7963">And they got rid of the lawyer who had gotten rich representing the Board and keeping the system segregated.</sentence><sentence id="7964">This case that I was working on had been filed many years before that and the NAACP had sort of reactivated it and urged the government to enter the case, which we did.</sentence><sentence id="7965">And so when we moved down there with four or five lawyers, and Jean came <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 108 with me, we had not been married too long and we rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, we lived there four or five months getting ready for this trial.</sentence><sentence id="7966">And when it was over, we took a big trip and nine months later our son Michael was born.</sentence><sentence id="7967">Actually we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calgary</span> and... you ever been up there?</sentence><sentence id="7968"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Louise</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Banff</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7969">Wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7970"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span>, I still sort of scratch my head a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="7971">I haven't kept up with what... there was an appeal of that order.</sentence><sentence id="7972">And I wrote part of the brief on appeal.</sentence><sentence id="7973">Still have it with me.</sentence><sentence id="7974">But I always felt a little badly about the limited result of the pairing of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, but I think it helped a great deal in the long run in different ways, to move that system from what it had been, where they had just let the black <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> deteriorate into such terrible condition.</sentence><sentence id="7975">Then let's see, Michael was born in 1970, I still had a hearing, a pre-trial, I think, not a pre-trial, but a conference right after he was born.</sentence><sentence id="7976">We delayed it because I expected him to be born in April.</sentence><sentence id="7977">So, that was April 1970.</sentence><sentence id="7978">I think that's about it.</sentence><sentence id="7979">I don't know if you're thinking about something else in the case.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8047">Q: You talked about how you had come to <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> and the whole process of establishing yourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> and some of the challenges involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="8048">And I thought maybe you might want to say a little bit more about... one of the things that has struck me, just in reading a little bit about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appalred</span> and the early years and your talking about it last time that we talked here, is that when you talked about the difficulty of getting established, you said that it was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="8049">But from what other people have said, they suggested that it was a lot more difficult than you let on the last time that we talked.</sentence><sentence id="8050">I wondered if there's...

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8059">A: I don't, I don't, no, I don't think I had thought about being out of here.</sentence><sentence id="8060">There were a couple of things probably, one was one of the earliest cases that we were involved with, involved the local health care establishment, for example.</sentence><sentence id="8061">There was a federal program in here, that wanted to set up what is now a federally funded <span class="BUILDING">health care clinic</span>, that <span class="BUILDING">Eulah Hall</span> was associated with.</sentence><sentence id="8062">But the governing agency was a Community Action agency, which had some public officials and local doctors, who were either on the Board or very close to the governing Board and they basically didn't want this thing to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="8063">They were going to use it primarily as a taxi service to... they had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span>, which was fully equipped sitting out, for example, at Mud Creek, but all they used it for was people would go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> and then they'd drive them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prestonsburg</span> to get their medical services from Prestonsburg physicians, that would get money.</sentence><sentence id="8064">So, they were reimbursing them for services, but they wouldn't allow anybody to be treated out there.</sentence><sentence id="8065">Not even a nurse to give them shots.</sentence><sentence id="8066">And then they employed a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="8067">The <span class="BUILDING">local medical establishment</span> threw a lot of <span class="DLF">roadblocks</span> into his getting a license.</sentence><sentence id="8068">And it was just a lot of trouble getting it.</sentence><sentence id="8069">So the welfare rights groups came to me and we filed some administrative complaints and basically threatened to close the thing down.</sentence><sentence id="8070">I mean their decision was if it wasn't going to work and be responsive, let's just not have it.</sentence><sentence id="8071">Let's not waste the money.</sentence><sentence id="8072">Well, two things happened, one was, of course, that Jean wasn't sure who her doctor would be, since 108</sentence><sentence id="8074"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 109 they were all mad at us.</sentence><sentence id="8075">And so she wondered if she could get any child care, any medical care for her son, who was less than a year old, or just about a year old.</sentence><sentence id="8076">And then the establishment, the doctors or the agency complained to Congressman Perkins(r) about it and he asked for an audit by the General Accounting Office of what we were doing, not just in this case.</sentence><sentence id="8077">There was at the same time a lot of hostility by local lawyers to having our get started.</sentence><sentence id="8078">They thought basically we were going to take money out of their pockets.</sentence><sentence id="8079">So the GAO sent an inspector here, which wasn't too... but he was in our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for about a month.</sentence><sentence id="8080">He looked at all, every piece of paper and then he issued... they ended up issuing a report which was really very favorable and complimentary.</sentence><sentence id="8081">And when I called Congressman Perkins to ask him about this thing, about his request, he said not to worry about it.</sentence><sentence id="8082">He was doing it to placate the local officials.</sentence><sentence id="8083">He was sure it was going to work out okay.</sentence><sentence id="8084">So there were things like that.</sentence><sentence id="8085">And I had the <span class="BUILDING">local Bar</span> was quite hostile.</sentence><sentence id="8086">I went to them on one occasion and asked them, told them I wanted to set up a system to refer clients to lawyers who, if the clients weren't eligible for our services, if they made too much money, that we wanted a fair system.</sentence><sentence id="8087">So, would they want to give me a list of the lawyers in some order, the ones that would take certain cases and not take... So he appointed a committee to look into it.</sentence><sentence id="8088">The President said he thought that was a good suggestion.</sentence><sentence id="8089">Well, the committee met and their resolution was to suggest that we leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, that we not practice law here without their permission.</sentence><sentence id="8090">It was sort of an indication of the atmosphere.</sentence><sentence id="8091">I mean there were a few, well I don't know that we had any lawyers who were <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8092">There were a couple of lawyers who had been here earlier, who had had a run in with me, but they were philosophically supportive of free legal services.</sentence><sentence id="8093">Because I wasn't the... when I first came, there were some lawyers who had been working here with welfare rights folks.</sentence><sentence id="8094">They started something called Mountain People's Rights.</sentence><sentence id="8095">They saw their role more as being organizers than as being lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="8096">They had not gotten their licenses, so we had a serious difference of opinion about how this needed to be done.</sentence><sentence id="8097">Cold air out here.</sentence><sentence id="8098">Oh, that's the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air conditioning</span>, that's what that is.</sentence><sentence id="8099">Is it too cold?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8146">A: No, it's just blowing down, I didn't know where it came from.</sentence><sentence id="8147">So, there were those things.</sentence><sentence id="8148">And I mean the medical... and the fact that I had hired, the first two lawyers I hired, J.T. Begley, Joe's son, who had just come out of the Marines and gone to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and Mort Stamm, both of them were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> and were staying down during the week and then they would go back on a weekend to their families.</sentence><sentence id="8149">So, it was not a, it took a while to, I really didn't have any friends or that much of a support system, especially since I was also sort of fighting with the other lawyers who had been here.</sentence><sentence id="8150">And Jean was a new mother and was just trying to get to know a few people who might share values, because the lawyers, the wives of the private practitioners, were really garden club types or people who were pretty much interested in money and materialism.</sentence><sentence id="8151">But she then, she started, gradually started teaching childbirth classes.</sentence><sentence id="8152">That was a big, sort of avocation of hers and got her to have an interest <span class="NPIP">outside</span> of being at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8153">So I think the first, those early, that early year was probably... wasn't much lonesomeness, I think it was beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="8154">I mean we knew, at the time we were not so sure that we would be here that long.</sentence><sentence id="8155">I think it was much more, as you said, "They're not going to run me out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8156">We're going to set this up.</sentence><sentence id="8157">We're going to get started.</sentence><sentence id="8158">There's a lot of work that needs to be done."</sentence><sentence id="8159">Legally there were many more black and white, if you will, issues.</sentence><sentence id="8160">The law was, I mean the law did not USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 110 favor welfare claimants.</sentence><sentence id="8161">A lot of things which we take for granted today, like the right to a hearing and the right to your medical records, if you're involved in one of these, those things had not been established and they seem very basic.</sentence><sentence id="8162">So there were a number of these, almost every time you looked at something involving a poor person against an official in one of these <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span>, including the environmental stuff.</sentence><sentence id="8163">There was so much to do and so much that needed to be done, that very few others were doing, that the work was very, very interesting from the very beginning.</sentence><sentence id="8164">It was very challenging.</sentence><sentence id="8165">We were just sort of outsiders, who were not particularly welcome in the community.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8194">A: Oh I think people who come to you as a lawyer for free service, especially who are just, who realize that lawyers are there, who want to help them and are interested in them and are treating them like people.</sentence><sentence id="8195">And then when they see that in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> they are meeting the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> with the same, if not even better, with more competent lawyers, they're pretty proud of that.</sentence><sentence id="8196">And I think the clients have been... always from the first day, even when I was in the Civil Rights Division when I represented the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I always admired them a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="8197">Most of them had difficult lives, have serious problems.</sentence><sentence id="8198">They're very genuinely nice people.</sentence><sentence id="8199">They don't always have the advantages that the rest of us have.</sentence><sentence id="8200">Sometimes in the domestic relations cases, there really aren't any winners and the children are losers.</sentence><sentence id="8201">And I don't know... we have a lot of debates in legal services about the value of spending so much time on domestic cases.</sentence><sentence id="8202">And back then probably the divorce rate was probably twenty-five percent, today it's over fifty.</sentence><sentence id="8203">So, the demand for what we do in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, because people fight over kids.</sentence><sentence id="8204">And the legal system hasn't adjusted.</sentence><sentence id="8205">You have to have a lawyer in these things and there just aren't enough lawyers to go around.</sentence><sentence id="8206">In this <span class="REGION">area</span> there aren't enough people who can afford lawyers, so you either have people who go without representation, if they don't... or they have to look to us.</sentence><sentence id="8207">But on some of the larger issues, the consumer cases or even the evictions or the others, that generally oftentimes you have an opportunity, to help someone make a real difference in their lives.</sentence><sentence id="8208">As you can see in the case listings that we put together, I think that those are all very significant, very important.</sentence><sentence id="8209">I think that's so, but it was not an easy start.</sentence><sentence id="8210">And now in retrospect, it doesn't seem like it's not such a huge amount of time.</sentence><sentence id="8211">And I think, I've always said I don't twist anybody's arm to come to this program.</sentence><sentence id="8212">You have to want to be happy in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and that has pluses and minuses.</sentence><sentence id="8213">You can't get lost in anonymity, which I think small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> have a lot going for them.</sentence><sentence id="8214">But at the same time you can feel very isolated if you're going uphill, and we often are.</sentence><sentence id="8215">I mean you're stepping on toes a lot.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8270">A: It seems that <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> just won't regulate themselves.</sentence><sentence id="8271">They will not.</sentence><sentence id="8272">We've seen that over and over again, whether it's the chemical industry or the mining industry.</sentence><sentence id="8273">Because where people are looking for profit, primarily, they don't want to shut something, a <span class="DLF">mine</span> down, long enough to fix what's broken or to take real measures to keep dust levels down until somebody has made them do it.</sentence><sentence id="8274">Because every time you do that, you have to slow production down a little bit and you won't produce as much.</sentence><sentence id="8275">So, as a result you have a high incidence of black lung disease and you have an unfriendly worker environment.</sentence><sentence id="8276">Finally things have started changing in the last few years.</sentence><sentence id="8277">So now I think it's much more accepted, if that's the right word, I think people even can understand or they see it happening and they see that that's probably one of the roles that we play.</sentence><sentence id="8278">And that we have done over the years, but I think at the same time they can see that what we do is responsible.</sentence><sentence id="8279">That we have good lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="8280">That we don't make up law suits and that generally there's a good reason for what we do.</sentence><sentence id="8281">When we can do something in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>, like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">housing project</span>, where we're working with public officials, who are now, who want to do something for people who let's say live in substandard <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>, out of their own sense of duty or their own feeling that everybody's entitled to have a decent <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live in.</sentence><sentence id="8282">If you've got that sort of in county government, then those are people we can work with and not have to sue.</sentence><sentence id="8283">I mean, I'd like nothing better than to have us, to be able to put ourselves out of business.(Laughing.)</sentence><sentence id="8284">But, I don't know, I think that's a long way off.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="8303">(Laughing.)</sentence><sentence id="8304">Do you, okay, so last time you talked about the Broad Form Deed and how that case was dealt with and the victory that resulted from that.</sentence><sentence id="8305">And you talked about the development of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">David</span> and I'm wondering... and you also talked about the establishment of the Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which was called Fair Tax Coalition first, and the work that that organization started on doing.</sentence><sentence id="8306">So I think those were the main things that you talked about during this era that you have been in <span

anything else?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8309">A: Well, I think we've... there are some other sort of unique things that we've done.</sentence><sentence id="8310">I think I'm very proud of the work that we've done on behalf of coal miners, who have refused to work in unsafe conditions.</sentence><sentence id="8311">We established a mine safety project, where we represent those miners in seeking a reinstatement and damages for having been fired unjustly--excuse me--or discriminated against unjustly.</sentence><sentence id="8312">I think that's been real successful.</sentence><sentence id="8313">And the lawyer who did that for a number of years, Tony Oppegard, who is now the Assistant to the Director of the Mine Health and Safety Administration, who was an Appalred lawyer in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> years ago.</sentence><sentence id="8314">I think that's been very significant.</sentence><sentence id="8315">We've represented a lot of disabled coal miners in applications for black lung benefits, this federal program, where so many people, right now, ninety-five percent of the people are denied, because the governmental regulations are so severe and it's so difficult to obtain the claims.</sentence><sentence id="8316">But we still manage... and the <span class="BUILDING">private bar</span> hardly does those cases at all.</sentence><sentence id="8317">So we've worked with the Black Lung Association, Bill Worthington, for example, officers of the Black Lung Association, in trying to get Congress to be, relax those requirements and to have better regulations that are fairer, that we see a more reasonable number 112</sentence><sentence id="8319"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 113 of people be approved for black lung benefits.</sentence><sentence id="8320">We have won many of those claims, the ones that we've screened and where private attorneys finally gave up.</sentence><sentence id="8321">Because it takes so long for private attorneys to get their fees and because they're so complex and take so long, we're going to get another lawyer to come in pretty soon, nearer in the next few months to do that.</sentence><sentence id="8322">And the mine safety and black lung work sort of go hand in hand.</sentence><sentence id="8323">The same thing is true of coal miner, of pension benefits.</sentence><sentence id="8324">We had a case we went to the United States Supreme Court on involving pension benefits where we lost.</sentence><sentence id="8325">But it really helped them, I think, in some ways to re-write their requirements.</sentence><sentence id="8326">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gracie</span>, it's the Gracie Robinson case, a woman up here, a widow up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auxier</span>, whose husband had worked over thirty years in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span>, but had not stopped working and applied.</sentence><sentence id="8327">And he died in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> in an accident.</sentence><sentence id="8328">And the requirements for obtaining a widow's pension was that the miner should have applied for a pension and stopped working.</sentence><sentence id="8329">And since he was killed in a mine accident they said he hadn't applied for his pension, they wouldn't give her her pension.</sentence><sentence id="8330">We said that was arbitrary.</sentence><sentence id="8331">If he's worked thirty years and you only have to have twenty-five to get a pension.</sentence><sentence id="8332">And he wanted to keep working, that it was like punishment at that point.</sentence><sentence id="8333">We won and then we lost in the <span class="BUILDING">District court</span> and then we won in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and then we lost in the United States Supreme Court.</sentence><sentence id="8334">But they did actually re-write that provision in the bargaining contract.</sentence><sentence id="8335">But I think the work we do for low, for disabled miners has been really important.</sentence><sentence id="8336">I think the... in the last few years we've started a migrant farm worker program up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>, where we got some money from the legal services Corporation to help migrant workers throughout the state.</sentence><sentence id="8337">We have a very small grant.</sentence><sentence id="8338">It's only about 35,000 dollars, so we've done that co-operatively with a program in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> that represents these folks full time.</sentence><sentence id="8339">And we've managed to file some of the first cases with respect to working conditions.</sentence><sentence id="8340">I mean there are cases where the workers come up here and the grower breaches the contract or at least our workers claim the growers have breached their contract by not providing the working time that they claimed they would or the working conditions under which they would work.</sentence><sentence id="8341">And the program, the <span class="REGION">Western Kentucky</span> program had the grant a few of years ago and they just could not really find the workers and we were, by getting together with the people in <span class="REGION">Texas</span>, the paralegal from <span class="REGION">Texas</span> came up and who helped... who helped to do this project, did the outreach work.</sentence><sentence id="8342">And oh [YAWNS] and for example he would meet the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Greyhound bus</span> coming in at one o'clock in the morning at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and give out his card to the workers and then they would know how to contact him.</sentence><sentence id="8343">That kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="8344">And you have to be bilingual, obviously, but I think that's been a very, even though we have very few migrant workers out here in <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span>, there are a number of other areas in the state, especially where they have large <span class="DLF">tobacco farms</span> in <span class="REGION">Western Kentucky</span>, that's where we've had so many of our cases.</sentence><sentence id="8345">I think most recently the development of our housing coalition here, called LINKS(r)", where we're doing this huge home repair project.</sentence><sentence id="8346">With all the groups that are coming in from out of state.</sentence><sentence id="8347">And just bringing all these <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> together under one <span class="DLF">roof</span>, so they can collaborate and work together, I think has been a real positive development.</sentence><sentence id="8348">Showing people how they can, I mean we've pulled together a lot of different agencies and non-profits, who are all addressing housing issues, into one collaborative.</sentence><sentence id="8349">And I think everybody's been real pleased with that.</sentence><sentence id="8350">I think we've been able to do that because we don't have any <span class="DLF">axes</span> to grind or turf.</sentence><sentence id="8351">We just said, ""We want to do this and we're willing to do it if you all will cooperate and we can seek funding together, and do some cooperative work."</sentence><sentence id="8352">And so now I actually am sharing a grant with the <span class="BUILDING">fiscal court</span>, which would have, and for a worker here, who is a young woman who came from Jean's program.</sentence><sentence id="8353">A participant, who is very, very <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 114 bright and who has moved up very fast.</sentence><sentence id="8354">Who is a single parent.</sentence><sentence id="8355">Could go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> if she were willing.</sentence><sentence id="8356">And that makes me feel good.</sentence><sentence id="8357">And we've had a number of people like that, who are single parents, who have been on welfare, who have worked with us in a training situation over a few months" time and have really, really sort of progressed so quickly and come out of their shell and have moved on to good jobs.</sentence><sentence id="8358">I think we have a pretty extraordinary group in most of the <span

they do.</sentence><sentence id="8360">Many of them have been with me a long time and each of them has different skills, but they're all committed to what we, this representation of low-income persons, who otherwise wouldn't be able to have lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="8361">Whether it's for a mundane situation or something that is pretty exciting, that will really effect a lot of other people in the future.</sentence><sentence id="8362">I think we've, I think we do very, very good legal work and I think we have real committed people who are doing it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8419">Q: Do you want to say anything, you've been mentioning that it's been kind of a turbulent time for legal services in general.</sentence><sentence id="8420">Do you want to say something about your perspective on the state of legal services and what direction it might be taking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8423">A: Well it's all conjecture.</sentence><sentence id="8424">I think those of us who have been doing this a long time are sort of, have been disappointed the last few years, because we really have not been able to get appreciable new funding at the federal level.</sentence><sentence id="8425">And this program was established at the <span class="REGION">federal level</span> to provide free legal services to the poor and to be a non-political program.</sentence><sentence id="8426">When it was the last, one of the last things that President Nixon signed, was this Bill that created this corporation.</sentence><sentence id="8427">And we expanded and got additional money from 1974 to 1980.</sentence><sentence id="8428">And we went from like forty million nationally or fifty, to three hundred and twenty-one.</sentence><sentence id="8429">And when Governor Reagan came in as president he was ready to destroy, to get rid of legal services, because of his experience.</sentence><sentence id="8430">They had sued him in <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8431">And I won't go through all that history, but really since the Reagan and that first year, instead of getting rid of us they made a compromise and we lost twenty-five percent of our money, which is a lot.</sentence><sentence id="8432">And we've never really recouped that money.</sentence><sentence id="8433">We're now still not at the level we were in 1980.</sentence><sentence id="8434">So that most of us have half as many lawyers as we did in 1981.</sentence><sentence id="8435">We were able to... but there have been many efforts in the meantime in Congress to just eliminate the program.</sentence><sentence id="8436">And we've been able to forestall that, which says a lot.</sentence><sentence id="8437">Because congressional support now is pretty strong.</sentence><sentence id="8438">Unfortunately the subcommittee chair for legal services is from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">District</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8439">It's Hal Rogers from Somerset.</sentence><sentence id="8440">And whereas he's able to bring back lots of money for other local projects, he has never, either he's not a fan of legal services, or he is trying to mollify the people above him and the others whom he works with, because his latest... for the last couple of years, that committee has passed out a recommended budget which is only about half the size of our funding level, 140 out of 300 million dollars.</sentence><sentence id="8441">And that's been real disappointing, but he likes to say that he is keeping it going and that there are budgetary shortages, and that the other people on his committee are not as strong as he is.</sentence><sentence id="8442">And he would be supportive.</sentence><sentence id="8443">And besides he knows that our supporters will be able to get the funding level up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">House</span>, once it gets to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8444">And that's what's happened.</sentence><sentence id="8445">But I'm disappointed in him.</sentence><sentence id="8446">I wish he were a little more aggressive or could do more at his end, which he probably could if he wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="8447">But... excuse me just a moment.</sentence><sentence id="8448">In the meantime we've been fortunate to get some money through the State Legislature and I think that's been a real positive thing in the last few years, where our own legislators have recognized the importance of legal services.</sentence><sentence id="8449">We did not get any more money this year, but we did get a repeat 114</sentence><sentence id="8451"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 115 of last year and so about half of our funding is now state funding.</sentence><sentence id="8452">I think it's conjecture, as I was telling you there are lots of possibilities.</sentence><sentence id="8453">I think our current corporation feels that it's more efficient to have a single entity in the state, covering the state.</sentence><sentence id="8454">Because the President of the corporation is a former private attorney from the state of Washington, however, where they have a very effective, single state program.</sentence><sentence id="8455">Time will tell us what will happen there.</sentence><sentence id="8456">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="8457">And some other... anybody else?</sentence><sentence id="8458">I think I just lost my train of thought.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8498">A: I was talking about the state funding, right?</sentence><sentence id="8499">That we didn't get any more funding this time or that we were... how far did I get with state funding?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8502">Q: Said that this year, you're at the same level that you were at last year.</sentence><sentence id="8503">You weren't cut anymore, but...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8506">A: We weren't cut and we were very pleased that we were able to get additional money last time.</sentence><sentence id="8507">We have two sources of state funding, one for the filing fee and one for a general appropriation.</sentence><sentence id="8508">And this time, many programs did not get increases.</sentence><sentence id="8509">There were a lot of one-time expenditures, like the <span class="BUILDING">Science Center</span>, got a little more money.</sentence><sentence id="8510">But I think a lot of ongoing projects, except for the new ones like the childcare money that I think actually, some of it's out of the tobacco money.</sentence><sentence id="8511">So, this is a year again, where we have no more new money, state or federal.</sentence><sentence id="8512">And that makes it difficult because if you want to give people salary increases, you either have to lose positions or something else to free up additional funds.</sentence><sentence id="8513">I don't know whether... and so there is this tendency in our <span class="BUILDING">funding agency</span> to pull programs together.</sentence><sentence id="8514">There is the thought that state- wide programs are more efficient.</sentence><sentence id="8515">I don't think there is any real proof of that anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="8516">I mean I don't know that they have evidence of that.</sentence><sentence id="8517">It may be more efficient to administer, because one person can make a decision instead of four.</sentence><sentence id="8518">You might be able to be more homogeneous around the state.</sentence><sentence id="8519">I would like to think that legal services is here to stay.</sentence><sentence id="8520">I think for the most part it is.</sentence><sentence id="8521">I think there are people in Congress, who think of, that it could be organized differently.</sentence><sentence id="8522">When I was talking about a state-wide organization.</sentence><sentence id="8523">Or whether... I know that one of my counterparts in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> would rather be part, consolidate with us, because our client population is so much the same.</sentence><sentence id="8524">The <span class="REGION">Appalachian counties</span> do have a lot in common.</sentence><sentence id="8525">Whereas in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> you have only, all of the state in <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span> is in <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8526">And <span class="REGION">Virginia</span>, a small part of the <span class="REGION">state</span> is in <span class="REGION">Appalachia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8527">So, whether they would allocate enough resources to that one or two programs in that <span class="NPIP">corner</span> is something that time will just have to tell.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8550">Q: Do you want to take a break and stretch out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8552">A: I think I need...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8553">A: Well, the other thing that's been so difficult with legal services has been the restrictions that Congress has placed on us in more recent years, which prevent us from filing Class Actions or challenging Welfare Reforms, accepting attorney fees, not being able to represent prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="8554">Those things all seem to, one could view them as making us second class lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="8555">There is no real, rational explanation for them when the preamble to the legal services Corporation Act states that you should not interfere with the professional responsibility to your client.</sentence><sentence id="8556">And that clients 115</sentence><sentence id="8558">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 116 have the right to have full representation from legal services lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="8559">So there's, it's not a very favorable atmosphere to work under.</sentence><sentence id="8560">It doesn't mean we still can't do ninety-five percent of the cases, because many of them still fit into, aren't affected by those prohibitions.</sentence><sentence id="8561">But it is something that needs to be changed.</sentence><sentence id="8562">And it's purely a political affair.</sentence><sentence id="8563">And you have the national opponents of legal services, who are always looking for one more anecdote to pull out as being the kind of thing that goes on.</sentence><sentence id="8564">I mean, no one's perfect.</sentence><sentence id="8565">So you find somebody's statistics aren't quite right and all of a sudden everybody in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> has to be on guard for an inspection, even though we... the way we are funded is by the number of poor people in our <span class="REGION">areas</span>, not by the number of cases we do.</sentence><sentence id="8566">So there's always a level of, if not harassment, of paperwork that grows and grows and leaves less time for the real work that needs to be done.</sentence><sentence id="8567">But at that same time it's good that we are able to get this money because you really can't fund this kind of work with private fundraising.</sentence><sentence id="8568">You could do a limited amount of it, but not very much.</sentence><sentence id="8569">We, I think we're fortunate to be able to get good lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="8570">We don't pay equivalent salaries.</sentence><sentence id="8571">And we have people coming to work with very large, outstanding loans from undergraduate and <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8572">We've instituted a small repayment program that is helpful.</sentence><sentence id="8573">But we've just increased our starting salaries to $27,000, which is a big step forward.</sentence><sentence id="8574">It's still behind many of the <span class="BUILDING">private firms</span> and many of the state and federal agencies.</sentence><sentence id="8575">And then we only go up about thirteen hundred a year for, first for nine months and then for a year.</sentence><sentence id="8576">But all the same, I think we're competitive and we have some good benefits.</sentence><sentence id="8577">And we are able, have been fortunate to get people who are really committed.</sentence><sentence id="8578">So I am very proud of the work we do.</sentence><sentence id="8579">I am very proud of the people who are here and who do the work.</sentence><sentence id="8580">We have wonderful relations, I also should mention with the <span class="BUILDING">spouse abuse shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8581">That's another project we've started in the last few years, is to have specialists who work, who represent abused spouses at domestic violence hearings.</sentence><sentence id="8582">And we've gotten very involved in that <span class="REGION">area</span> and I think the family court judges appreciate us and the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> appreciate us.</sentence><sentence id="8583">And it is a huge amount of our practice, more than we would like.</sentence><sentence id="8584">But it's one of those societal problems that we have to deal with, so we are very interested in the rights of children and the rights of these women.</sentence><sentence id="8585">Of course, it's wonderful to have people like my wife, Jean, out trying to help move them, gain some independence and get back into education and develop their careers in a way that they can be productive and independent on their own.</sentence><sentence id="8586">I've been real proud of the people that have come from her program into my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, both for representation and several who, at least one of whom is employed now as a full-time person here.</sentence><sentence id="8587">It continues to be pretty exciting work.</sentence><sentence id="8588">I never, never lack for anything to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="8639">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="8640">Well, I was a chemistry major as I think you know, and I think that we've always known that the scores of our students here in science and math were very low and that science, math and technology was not valued very highly.</sentence><sentence id="8641">So a number of years ago, maybe nineteen, somewhere between 1990 and "92, I asked teachers, some teachers to come together and some other folks in the community to see whether we might not start a, developing some ideas for improving math and science, and what they thought.</sentence><sentence id="8642">And what we learned was that teachers were very uneasy about teaching math and science.</sentence><sentence id="8643">Many of them had very poor backgrounds during their teacher training and they were ill-equipped, especially at the elementary level, to try to present scientific concepts.</sentence><sentence id="8644">And they really wanted more hands-on activities to support them.</sentence><sentence id="8645">So we, we sort of met periodically and then over the next couple of years.</sentence><sentence id="8646">And then I saw a small video segment, or heard about it, about a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> up in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="REGION">Western Pennsylvania</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Juniata College</span>", which had obtained funding for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">science van</span>, where a chemistry teacher was driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> around and dropping experiments off at <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span>, dropping off equipment that the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> couldn't afford to buy.</sentence><sentence id="8647">And was like a sort of Johnny or Jeanie Appleseed, would tell <span class="BUILDING">school A</span> about what <span class="BUILDING">school B</span> had done with these things.</sentence><sentence id="8648">Over the course of several years the number of incoming students at <span class="BUILDING">Juniata College</span> who were, who majored in or who showed an interest in science, studying science-related courses, like tripled.</sentence><sentence id="8649">So, I thought it would be, then got to thinking that we would like to, wouldn't it be nice if we did something like that.</sentence><sentence id="8650">I had not, I don't think had really thought about the <span class="BUILDING">planetarium theater</span> kind of thing yet.</sentence><sentence id="8651">But we were meeting and we got a small grant back about 1990, maybe "94 as a result of this work and this group that kept meeting.</sentence><sentence id="8652">We realized that we could maybe establish a <span class="BUILDING">center</span> like that if we could get some funding.</sentence><sentence id="8653">So, we got a little money out of the <span class="BUILDING">legislature</span>, I think 75,000 dollars to hire a consultant.</sentence><sentence id="8654">One of the legislators here in this <span class="REGION">area</span>, Greg Stumbo", was interested in technology and with KERA" having come in I think there was a strong, an atmosphere that was conducive to getting some funding.</sentence><sentence id="8655">And I thought we should start off in a small way, so we hired a consultant from <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span>, Mike Howard, who had worked in the Kentucky educational system, to do some community meetings and help us look at more specifically where we fit and what kind of activities would be helpful.</sentence><sentence id="8656">And it sort of reinforced what we had already known in some ways, that teachers wanted hands-on Mr. Wizard kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="8657">And that if we could bring presentations to them and do something like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">science van</span> and educational programs, that that would be helpful.</sentence><sentence id="8658">And I don't know where I first came up with the idea of trying to do a <span class="BUILDING">planetarium</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">science museum</span> or really, I thought it might be nice if we could even replicate a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8659">But I started, we started talking that up and realized that if we had a modern <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> it would be really meaningful.</sentence><sentence id="8660">And I also learned that you could, they had these portable planetariums that you could take around to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, which are little... they call them planetarium in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">foot locker</span>, where you blow up, it's like a vinyl thing and you blow it USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0007 118 up in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and you can put thirty kids in it that will watch a star

dollars.</sentence><sentence id="8662">We were able to increase our operating grant and on a fairly short notice we got a local architect to put together just a schematic of what a <span

I think we may have even still been thinking about a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8663">And we put together a board, I organized a board of directors that included representatives from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Morehead</span> and from the Alice Lloyd"!</sentence><sentence id="8664">and <span class="BUILDING">Pikeville College</span> and PCC" and Hazard and the teachings, the science teachers and the regional educational cooperatives to give us a good cross-section of membership and also a good geographical cross- section.</sentence><sentence id="8665">And it's been, and that's basically the story.</sentence><sentence id="8666">And they helped me, we went to convince them, during the last legislative session, our local legislator agreed to get behind it and we made a presentation to the Governor and he liked it and called me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day to go over the budget.</sentence><sentence id="8667">Wanted to know why I had a budget item for rent.</sentence><sentence id="8668">He was very meticulous. "</sentence><sentence id="8669">Why do you need this three hundred dollars when you're going to have...?"</sentence><sentence id="8670">I said, "Governor, we won't be in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a couple, few years yet.</sentence><sentence id="8671">We need a <span class="BUILDING">budget place</span>, we need an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>."</sentence><sentence id="8672">But anyway, we got through that with two and a half million dollars, and then this time... so we planned some more, but because of the reorganization of the <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, Kentucky college system, KCTCS and UK(tm), the two years went by without any <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8673">There was a lot of planning, but we just got caught in the upheaval of this educational thing, until KCTCS could get on its feet.</sentence><sentence id="8674">So, in the meantime we put together a proposal for another million dollars, probably should have been for more.</sentence><sentence id="8675">And after all the wrangling, we were one of the fortunate ones at the end to get the million dollars, because Greg Stumbo, who is from here, is a pretty powerful figure and was essentially, he and Benny Ray Bailey, who got beat in this last election, were able to pretty much get all the one-time funding projects through that they asked for.</sentence><sentence id="8676">So, now we are, we just last week had our meeting with the architects and KCTCS folks and college representatives and we are settled on where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">site</span> is going to be and we have a basic floor plan.</sentence><sentence id="8677">And I hope two years from now the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> will be standing.</sentence><sentence id="8678">It probably will be.</sentence><sentence id="8679">And then that means another legislature will have passed and hopefully we might even increase the operating costs of our group.</sentence><sentence id="8680">We got a little more money for that.</sentence><sentence id="8681">But I'm very excited about what we will be able to do, both for students who are in this <span class="REGION">region</span>, who can't really, who never see this sort of thing at this sophisticated level.</sentence><sentence id="8682">There is now a <span class="BUILDING">planetarium</span> at Eastern in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Richmond</span>, which a lot of people don't even know about.</sentence><sentence id="8683">But I think if we do this well, it can stimulate a lot of interest in science and technology.</sentence><sentence id="8684">We have now decided to expand our <span class="BUILDING">laboratory facility</span> so that we will be able to, from a <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> into a sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory classroom</span>, so we can do experiments in DNA fingerprinting and other chemical experiments, at least demonstrative experiments.</sentence><sentence id="8685">And we're coming up with what I think is pretty exciting.</sentence><sentence id="8686">Our Director we've hired is from Pike County, he was born there, although he grew up in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8687">And we have, as I say, a very good board and so I'm, I think that it will be a very important part of the future of <span class="REGION">Eastern Kentucky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8688">I think that we now have a new industry in Pike County, a knowledge-based industry, where a <span class="BUILDING">call center</span>, Microsoft, if you call an 800 number for Microsoft and you need help on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computer</span>, they"!</sentence><sentence id="8689">pick up the phone down there and give you answers to technical questions from their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span>, which is a breakthrough in terms, because our coal economy is declining so quickly in terms of the number of people they can hire.</sentence><sentence id="8690">So this is an <span class="REGION">area</span> that we have to <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 119 move into, that I think can have an appreciable effect on kids.</sentence><sentence id="8691">People want to be scientists and they want to be astronomers and they want to be explorers and they can see that happen.</sentence><sentence id="8692">And I think that's what the role of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is going to be.</sentence><sentence id="8693">And obviously, you know, we're going to need more money and I could spend all my time raising money for this <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="8694">We're going to be hiring a development director, but I'm very much invested in this project.</sentence><sentence id="8695">So that's what it's about.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="9078">Maybe it's not a question, maybe it's just an observation, but you've, in your work have kind of devoted yourself to people who, really you naturally don't share a whole lot in common with, I mean as far as your own background and your own tradition.</sentence><sentence id="9079">And in some ways that's why...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="9080">because those people were separated from mainstream culture and because they were disadvantaged in various ways, that's why you felt the need to work with them.</sentence><sentence id="9081">But yet it seems that your own tradition as a Jew and as a refugee from Nazi Germany has been an important part of your identity.</sentence><sentence id="9082">I kind of wonder how you've kept that connection with your roots and with that tradition alive and whether that's been a difficult balance for you in a context that's so separate from it.</sentence><sentence id="9083">I think so many Jews and in particular so many refugees, so many survivors have felt the need to be among people who really understand what they've been through and who had experienced something similar to what they'd experienced.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9084">A: Well, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="9085">I think some people just feel the need to continue to...

hasn't been that hard.</sentence><sentence id="9120">I think the most difficult, the big difficulty is that, one difficulty is that most of us who are professionals in legal services or in others, who are in a helping profession or if that's the way we choose to live our lives, in a sense we live a pretty, we live, really, a middle-class life with our own surroundings.</sentence><sentence

their values.</sentence><sentence id="9125">And so you have to kind of make your own life and if you need a lot of friends in the community that may be difficult.</sentence><sentence id="9126">And I think to some extent that's why you have turnover in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9127">Or because you become absorbed in your own world and you do stay so

I think he, you know, he's like a lot of other political figures, but he came up the hard way and he wants to see this be a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live.</sentence><sentence id="9204">And he's willing to invest his time to try to improve <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and clean up garbage and do things that bring in industry.</sentence><sentence id="9205">And as long as we don't bump into each other over other <span class="NPIP">things</span>, I think that's a good thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="9206">And so those are the kind of things that help make being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> more, when you start thinking well maybe we can do things with others and make this a better <span class="NPIP">place</span> for everybody, even if we have to step on some toes.</sentence><sentence id="9207">The problem in <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> like these is the temptation with many <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span>, of course, especially state, to jump over, it's too easy to get co-opted.</sentence><sentence id="9208">And so you, as you were talking about, the problem in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> or any <span class="BUILDING">institution</span>, if you start becoming cautious because you're afraid somebody's going to cut your money off, or you're going to lose your job or something is going to happen, then you lose the effectiveness.</sentence><sentence id="9209">And I think we've been able to avoid that, I think, pretty well.</sentence><sentence id="9210">I think people know, have known me, that I don't want to get into that position.</sentence><sentence id="9211">And the people on both sides of the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, that I'm not going to do that.</sentence><sentence id="9212">IfI did that, I'd stop one or the other.</sentence><sentence id="9213">That I think that... it doesn't mean that you can't compromise.</sentence><sentence id="9214">But it is, you get put into those positions and that's hard, especially when you have funding sources that are problematical.</sentence><sentence id="9215">I mean, that's hard.</sentence><sentence id="9216">Like the migrant cases, when we had some publicity in one of the migrant cases that we filed and people went screaming to Congress.</sentence><sentence id="9217">My counterparts are worried we're going to lose the money in the State Legislature if they find out legal services is involved in this case.</sentence><sentence id="9218">That kind of stuff can be really hard, and you just try your best to get through it.</sentence><sentence id="9219">But I'm pretty pleased with where we've come.</sentence><sentence id="9220">I hope whoever takes over will keep it going that way.</sentence><sentence id="9221">Most of the people who run my <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, I think, have that philosophy.</sentence><sentence id="9222">I can't remember what you asked.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9752">A: Well, we're talking about and I was thinking about how you maintain your Judaism as it were.</sentence><sentence id="9753">A few years ago we learned that there was still a congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamson</span>, <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span>, which is about thirty-five miles from here, much closer than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> and we went over there one Friday night.</sentence><sentence id="9754">And found a very friendly group of people, who were meeting sort of monthly and being served by the rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Huntington</span>, <span class="REGION">West Virginia</span>, who comes down on a Sunday night to do a Friday night service.</sentence><sentence id="9755">And the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is an old, old <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9756">I don't know, probably a hundred years old at least.</sentence><sentence id="9757">It sits up on top of a <span class="DLF">hill</span> in the black section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamson</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9758">And there's no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> and you've got to walk up a huge bunch of <span class="DLF">steps</span>, well, probably twenty-five.</sentence><sentence id="9759">And the average age of the people other than us is about seventy.</sentence><sentence id="9760">But they've kept on going and they consist of folks from Welch and Grundy and nearby people who are in a probably twenty, thirty mile area from around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamson</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9761">I think twenty years ago during the height of the coal mining in this <span class="REGION">area</span> and maybe through the seventies and eighties I think they had fifty families.</sentence><sentence id="9762">Over the years the kids have moved away and so the older members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamson Jewish community</span> are still there.</sentence><sentence id="9763">And the President is a fellow named Bill Rosen, whose son is now a circuit judge in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ashland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9764">But it's been a nice group of people, and the rabbi, who is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Huntington</span>, is an interesting personality.</sentence><sentence id="9765">His wife teaches a, not Headstart, but Upward Bound program.</sentence><sentence id="9766">And I've actually been... the rabbi teaches a class at <span class="BUILDING">Marshall University</span> on Jewish studies.</sentence><sentence id="9767">And so I've visited his class and spoke about the Holocaust as sort of a living survivor.</sentence><sentence id="9768">But it is interesting, and then it's much nicer to go to a congregation of that sort, where every person that comes is one more person that makes a difference, rather than going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span>, where you've got a large congregation at <span class="BUILDING">Adath Israel</span> and there's also the Conservative, the Orthodox congregation there.</sentence><sentence id="9769">So, that's been very nice.</sentence><sentence id="9770">We actually have, there are other, three other Jewish mixed couples here.</sentence><sentence id="9771">Miriam Silman, whose father, by the way, had the contract to, was an engineer, who re-did, who did the plans to re-do <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Vernon</span>.</sentence><sentence

id="9774">And then Deborah Golden, who is a lawyer with my <span class="BUILDING">Pikeville office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9775">And then there is another couple in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pikeville</span>, Terry Mulliken, who's a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="9776">His wife, Cynthia, has been on my Board.</sentence><sentence id="9777">It used to be there's a

ours.</sentence><sentence id="9779">But they, and they go, now they're older and they go once ina while.</sentence><sentence id="9780">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Williamson community</span> was sort of the hub of the Jewish residents of this <span class="REGION">area</span> for many years.</sentence><sentence id="9781">Now there are probably twenty families that are left.</sentence><sentence id="9782">One of the younger set married, a young woman married an Israeli when she was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and they have a little boy.</sentence><sentence id="9783">They've recently been divorced.</sentence><sentence id="9784">Very few young members.</sentence><sentence id="9785">But it is there and we have, we joined that congregation, so that we once again do have a, sort of a formal tie to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> that's here, for whatever it's worth.</sentence><sentence id="9786">I guess it's worth putting that down.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9824">A: It's Reform.</sentence><sentence id="9825">Now the congregation the rabbi is from in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Huntington</span>, you had a Reform and an Orthodox congregation merge.</sentence><sentence id="9826">Really unusual.</sentence><sentence id="9827">And so it's sort of conservative.</sentence><sentence id="9828">And I think he actually has, for the benefit of the Orthodox members, he has services on Saturday morning as 132</sentence><sentence id="9830"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0007 133 well.</sentence><sentence id="9831">He's a very funny fellow, almost like a stand-up comic when he does sermons.</sentence><sentence id="9832">Because he" ll say something very serious and then it will jog his mind to kind of say something funny, reminds him of something funny.</sentence><sentence id="9833">But he's a very bright fellow.</sentence><sentence id="9834">It's a nice group.</sentence><sentence id="9835">I mean, it's obviously an older group and they depend on one or two people like the Rosens and one or two other families to sort of keep it going.</sentence><sentence id="9836">You know, once they got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air conditioning</span>...
