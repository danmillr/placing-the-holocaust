<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4795">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4797">A: You have to imagine that the nearer the 16" of October came, yes, when I was a child, the more -- not of my mother, but of my siblings, and the relatives, was the urge to celebrate.</sentence><sentence id="4798">To celebrate a man and the innocentess of a man which I, even then, despised, yes, without really knowing what he has done, when I was young.</sentence><sentence id="4799">Nine, eight, 10, 11 years old.</sentence><sentence id="4800">And this is a big pleasure on a little soul like mine, when you are young.</sentence><sentence id="4801">And it was just a relief, it was just a relief.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4807">Q: A relief, okay, okay, okay, interesting.</sentence><sentence id="4808">So, it seems that it's clear that your father constantly craved Hitler's approval, and was always disappointed because Hitler didn't really have much respect for him, if any at all.</sentence><sentence id="4809">And -- and that reads to me, at least, as a father-son relationship, the -- the f-- the father constantly disappointing the son.</sentence><sentence id="4810">And I -- I wonder if that is -- is a theme in the book in the sense that, you know, this relationships between fathers and sons, is there a parallel there?</sentence><sentence id="4811">Because you -- you rid -- you were rejected by your father, and then you rejected your father.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="4817">But, your f-- your -- your father never rejected Hitler til the -- til the end.</sentence><sentence id="4818">And I-I'm just wondering if you see any parallel there, if you see any cause -- cause the whole book seems to be about fathers and sons.</sentence><sentence id="4819">Mostly about your relationship with your --with your father, but there's also -- I kept thinking, there's this -- there's some kind of filial relation between Hitler and -- and Hans Frank that's not being fulfilled, 137 Interview with Niklas Frank June 6, 2016 the way Hans Frank wants it to be fulfilled.</sentence><sentence id="4820">So that's not really a question, it's just sort of an observation, and a -- and a -- and -- and a--I-- I'm just wondering what you think about that -- that theory.</sentence><sentence id="4821">You can tell me it's bullshit, if you want.</sentence></p></dialogue>
