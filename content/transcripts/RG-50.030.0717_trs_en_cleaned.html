<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="731">Q: Put yourself back at this time.</sentence><sentence id="732">Did you feel like you were watching a process that was fair, that seemed like you know, it may not have been perfect justice, but that rough justice was being done at the time?</sentence><sentence id="733">What was your feeling at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="737">A: It was as close as you could come when the winner tries the loser.</sentence><sentence id="738">And one of the questions that we asked Jackson was, "Why do you say that they are being given a fair trial?"</sentence><sentence id="739">And he went into great detail and says, you know, "We let them choose their own lawyers, and so if they wanted a Nazi for a lawyer, we approved that.</sentence><sentence id="740">We paid the lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="741">We gave them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work and fitted it out for them.</sentence><sentence id="742">We gave them copies of all the documents before we introduced them."</sentence><sentence id="743">You know, they did whatever they possibly could.</sentence><sentence id="744">And, also, the the judge Judge they could object, and a lot of times the objections were sustained.</sentence><sentence id="745">So | think it came as close as you could get to, you know, AngloSaxon type justice.</sentence><sentence id="746">And the other thing about it that I think speaks in favor of</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="750">what of a fair trial is there was a good deal of variation in the sentences.</sentence><sentence id="751">You know, there was 11, I think, of the 20</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="752">Q: And some were acquitted, too?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: Huh?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="755">Q: And some were acquitted, too?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="757">A: Three were acquitted.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="759">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="761">A: Three were acquitted.</sentence><sentence id="762">One of them should never have been tried, Fritzsche, who was Goebbels" he was like the fourth ranked guy under Goebbels, but but there was none of the rest of them were left, so he he got it.</sentence><sentence id="763">And so they and the judges, you know, saw that, you know, he was not really part of the group, so he was only about 38 years old, too, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="767">Q: Tell us, by the way, speaking of media people, Streicher was obviously convicted and later hung.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="769">A: Hung, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="771">Q: What were your impressions of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Streicher</span>?</sentence><sentence id="772">He comes across as a thug.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="775">A: Oh, a slob.</sentence><sentence id="776">You know, just an uncouth individual.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="779">Q: But did it seem to you that he was on trial, too, even though he was, you know, a you know, a publisher, he wasn't actually a part of the Nazi apparatus?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="781">A: You know, he had very little power, practically no power, as far as running the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is concerned, but but I think I think it was great symbolism to to include him, because he was so, you know you know, back during that period there was hardly a week or two or three weeks that you didn't read about Streicher in the American press as to remarks that he had made or things that he had done, antiSemitic stuff, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: So he was really conditioning the public for</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="784">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="785">And so I I would assume that Streicher was there more for public relations purposes than the fact that he was one of the perpetrators of starting the war or even what he did during the war, you know.</sentence><sentence id="786">He but</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Do you were you at all censored by your by your bosses or did they let you pretty much write what you want?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: You know, as I've gotten older, the greatest surprise that I think as I've thought over this thing, and particularly the way the information policy of the Army is now, is that</sentence><sentence id="791">literally no one read my script before it went on the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="792">I read it, and I showed it to my announcer, and every now and then they would say, you know, you are tangling me up in the stuff and could I make the changes, but and and no I never got a negative comment from any of my chain of command.</sentence><sentence id="793">In fact, the only time I ever heard from them was when I got the Jackson thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="801">Q: When you really kind of explained how Jackson had messed up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: No, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="804">When when we got the interview.</sentence><sentence id="805">It was a</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="806">Q: Oh, you had a oneonone interview with Justice Jackson?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="807">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="809">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="811">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="812">Yeah, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="815">Q: I did not know that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="817">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="818">And where a guy that was at</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="819">Q: Tell us about that a little bit.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="820">A: Huh?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="822">Q: Tell us about that interview.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="824">A: Well, Jackson at the beginning made a statement that he didn't want to make a circus out of this, and that he didn't want any second guessing on each day's testimony, so he, in effect, you know, admonished his own staff, and he said he would give no interviews until the trial was over.</sentence><sentence id="825">I knew his press secretary or got to know him, Gordon Dean, and I said you know, I tried to get through that, and he said, "No, the boss doesn't want to do it.</sentence><sentence id="826">He is afraid if he does something with you, that will break the <span class="DLF">line</span>."</sentence><sentence id="827">And one night I got the idea that the approach should be that he owes it to the soldiers who are still there to tell them what he is trying to do, and I told called my went up to see my friend and told him, and and he went and told Jackson what my argument was, and he says, you know, they are talking about people who fought this war who some of them, many of them injured, all of them lost friends, and then Jackson agreed, but he wanted the questions submitted in advance.</sentence><sentence id="828">And he did not change and he didn't change the questions either.</sentence><sentence id="829">He</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="830">Q: Do you recall the most do you recall any of the most interesting comments he made that stuck with you?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="834">A: Well, I guess the most quotable thing was that, "These people are being tried not because they lost the war, but because they started the war."</sentence><sentence id="835">And it was the interview was more scholarly than sensational.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="838">Q: But was it the only interview that Jackson gave during the trial?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="840">A: Yeah, uhhuh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="842">Q: That was a big scoop then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="844">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="845">Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="846">Yeah, AP</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="847">Q: Did it get picked up by</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="848">A: AP picked it up, and my hometown newspaper picked it up, and, you know, said, you know, "Memphian Harold Burson," you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="862">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="863">Let me ask you a couple other questions about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> before I move on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="868">Q: At the time of the trial, did you feel that this was a break through in legal affairs, that this was something that was going to really deter future</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="869">A: I, like a lot of other people, was fairly naive about this, and, you know, the world was hungry for someone to assure them that there are not going to be any wars like this anymore, and, of course, you know, that was Roosevelt's <span class="DLF">line</span>, you know, in getting the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> off the ground, and one of the things that Nocera pointed out</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="870">Q: This is Joe Nocera?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: Joe Nocera, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="880">Q: Yeah, two years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="885">A: And that's why what brought</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="886">Q: Yeah, this brought this all in play.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="887">A: this interest up, huh?</sentence><sentence id="888">Otherwise, it was still sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="889">Joe said that I guess the way he put it is that there was a refreshing naivety and that reflected world the sentiments of a lot of people in my scripts is one of the reasons he did the article, and the but, you know, in talking to reporters, I didn't find much cynicism.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="893">Q: So people thought this would be a huge advance in</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="894">A: Well, let me put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="895">Among the British and the Americans, that's the only ones that could communicate with the media, I didn't find much cynicism in the thing, in the feelings about the trial.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="896">Q: All right.</sentence><sentence id="897">So people felt it was fair?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: Yeah, yeah, people felt it was fair.</sentence><sentence id="901">Well, a lot of people felt it was more fair than it should be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="904">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="905">And people felt that it was going to stop future dictators or people who wanted to commit genocide?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: Yeah, that that that <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> wouldn't happen, you know, or <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> wouldn't happen.</sentence><sentence id="909">And, you know, you've got to remember this was part of a buildup for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="912">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="914">A: And so but but I I think the trial was as fair as it could be when the winning nation won, and I don't think any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> would have gone as far as the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="916">Q: Let me just think of one or two other questions.</sentence><sentence id="917">One thing about your reports is that they are really written in a very plain way, not a lot of highfalutin language.</sentence><sentence id="918">It felt to me you were almost trying to talk to the GI.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="922">A: That's what I that was my audience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="924">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="926">A: That was my audience.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="928">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="974">A: I did not want to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">company</span> as an employee.</sentence><sentence id="975">I was wellconnected with the management of the company, and the great mystery that I have not been able to explain fully is, you know, when I was traveling with Mr. Ferguson, I was 21, two and three, and I was his gatekeeper.</sentence><sentence id="976">I controlled his schedule to a large extent.</sentence><sentence id="977">I I received his mail.</sentence><sentence id="978">And the fact that I (End of videotape, interruption in Proceedings.)</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="979">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="980">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Harold Burson.</sentence><sentence id="981">Mr. Burson, you just were talking a little bit about your life after the war.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="985">A: Yeah, right.</sentence><sentence id="986">Well, yeah, I when he was traveling, I all the stuff came to me first, and the fact that I didn't piss off a lot of people is so remarkable to me that I you know, I just can't explain it, but in fact, you know, I had a lot of people who would you know, were happy that I was there so that I could, you know, expedite what they wanted to do, and it was just a very unique relationship.</sentence></p></dialogue>
