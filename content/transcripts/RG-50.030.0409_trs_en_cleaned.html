<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="22">A: I grew up in a Boston Jewish family, non-Jewish, no <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, as my son will say now.</sentence><sentence id="23">And I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> til I was 17 and went to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> for <span class="BUILDING">undergraduate school</span>, finished my graduate studies at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">I was certainly satisfied growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, but anxious to get away, as any teenager might be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="28">Q: And were you always interested in history?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="30">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="31">I did actually begin with a -- after the traditional dinosaub session as a young child.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: And when you went to <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span>, was George Masse there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: George Masse was there, my decision to go to <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> was dictated in part by the desire to get away, and in part by the strength of the history department there.</sentence><sentence id="51">And I worked with a scholar on the Nazi regime, and particularly, the particular interest in the SS, Robert Kale.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Who had been teaching at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wisconsin</span> until very recently --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: -- he retired just a couple of years ago.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: So did you t -- also take any courses with George Masse?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: I didn't take any courses with George Masse and that was because I decided to take a junior year abroad and took most of my German history courses in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Bohn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">By the time I came back and was eligible for the upperclassman courses for -- that Mosse and Hammereau, who was also another major scholar at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span>, were teaching, I had already run out of my requirements, and had to take other than history courses or non- European history courses to complete the degree.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="72">Q: Did you ever sneak in and watch him lecture?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Yes, on occasion, on occasion.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: And what did you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="78">A: I thought he was great.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: He was a wonderful lecturer and I certainly used his source material at the time.</sentence><sentence id="83">At that time he was perhaps most famous for his book, "The Crisis of German Ideology," which came out in the mid-60's.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: And this book was in part instrumental in educating me as to the root of the nat -- roots of the Nazi ideology, that is the intellectual roots of the Nazi ideology.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="91">So when you went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>, why w -- why the choice to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>, not to stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wisconsin</span>, do you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: [had wanted to stay at Wisconsin, but at the time my professor, Professor Kale was going through a difficult personal time, and he -- as it turned out wisely for me, said that he was not going to take on any new students at this time and advised that -- advised strongly that I should go to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">At <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> I worked under Professor Ishtvan Dayak, who was an east European scholar, but had excellent contacts in the former countries of the hap -- the former <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that made up the old Hapsburg monarchy.</sentence><sentence id="96">And between the <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> name and Dayak's contacts, it eventually opened up some <span class="DLF">doors</span> in central and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> that might not have been opened had I stayed at Wisconsin.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: And how did you continue your work at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span>?</sentence><sentence id="101">What was your major -- this -- this --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> with the idea of majoring in central and <span class="REGION">east European</span> history.</sentence><sentence id="108">There was more financial aid available for <span class="REGION">east European</span> history.</sentence><sentence id="109">This was the early 70's, in the time of detente, and it was very -- very important that young people study the history of this <span class="REGION">region</span>, in fact there were national defense scholarships for study of east European languages and I obtained one for studying Romanian.</sentence><sentence id="110">But primarily I went with the idea of studying German policy in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and that became my field of concentration.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: Let me go back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="116">Was there any -- besides the intellectual connection, and -- and the interest starting from Shirer's book, was there a personal connection in your family to World War II and the Holocaust that wa -- was also important for you, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: No, no, this was -- this was purely coming at it through history, and -- and frankly through military history.</sentence><sentence id="118">My family had, for the most part, had the good fortune, or perhaps the bad fortune to be the victims of pogroms or Tsarist draft notices, and fled to the New World at the beginning of this century.</sentence><sentence id="119">So with rare exceptions, particularly some cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, who managed to survive the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, most of the family was over in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before World War I.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Oh, I see.</sentence><sentence id="121">So when -- you graduated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> when? [</sentence><sentence id="122">indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: I got the PhD in 1981.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: 1981.</sentence><sentence id="125">And you decided not to teach, or -- si -- wa -- I had [indecipherable] you moved into --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: Well that -- that -- that wasn't my decision exactly.</sentence><sentence id="127">The 70's was a very difficult time for new graduates coming out and obtaining teaching jobs.</sentence><sentence id="128">I had had a couple of the -- they call them thousand dollar courses now, at that time I think they were 500 dollar courses.</sentence><sentence id="129">I'd taught a course on early modern European history, and I was scheduled to teach a course on World War II and on <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> when I was called by a representative of the U.S. attorney's</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="138"><span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and asked whether I would be interested in working for a short term period, gathering evidence for a case against a Nazi offender.</sentence><sentence id="139">In this particular case it was a Latvian auxiliary policeman named Boleslaus Maikovskis, who -- whose case had been publicized on "60 Minutes" some six months earlier, in the spring of 1978.</sentence><sentence id="140">So I was not only aware of the case, I was also -- I was also interested in the work, and should -- little anecdote that goes with that call, at the time I received the call, I was working in a fairly dead end job putting data onto computer sheets on the other side of the justice department's suit against the telephone company at that time, the AT &amp; T, which was the telephone company at that time.</sentence><sentence id="141">And it was a pretty dead-end job and I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> sick, suffering from a kidney stone, and about ready to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> when the call came in.</sentence><sentence id="142">And I had been feeling very sorry for myself, and thinking idly that it was too bad that I was too young to have been around at the time of the Nuremberg Trials.</sentence><sentence id="143">So it was almost like a stroke of a -- a divine stroke that that call came in at that time, and when asked if I was interested in working on such a project, I said, just let me pass the kidney stone, I'll be right in for an interview.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: Le -- let me ask you a question a bit about <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>, just t -- t-to know what the texture was at the -- at the time.</sentence><sentence id="151">Were there a lot of people studying World War IL, and the Nazis and the -- the Holocaust, or the structure of the Nazi regime, or were you an oddity at the time at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span>?</sentence><sentence id="152">I mean, what -- what was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> didn't have at that time, a specific World War II scholar.</sentence><sentence id="157">It did have a strong <span class="REGION">eastern European department</span>, but its modern -- its eastern European modernist, Voytek Mastney, who was my professor my first year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> didn't get tenure and had to leave at the end of 1972 - 1973.</sentence><sentence id="158">He went on to post-war studies in <span class="COUNTRY">Communism</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">And that was the focus at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span>, but that doesn't mean that there weren't -- there wasn't a generation of</sentence><sentence id="161">scholars, not studying the Holocaust per se, because that was still very much a political term, and not the term of [indecipherable] for this period as yet, certainly not in academic parlance.</sentence><sentence id="162">But there were a group of scholars who had been spawned and encouraged by the availability of captured German records on microfilm at the national archives.</sentence><sentence id="163">They were first available in an easy to use format on the microfilm in the early 1960's.</sentence><sentence id="164">And this was also the time in which the originals, which had been captured by the U.S. army, were returned to the Federal Republic of Germany in the mid-60's, according to treaty.</sentence><sentence id="165">And we -- I was sort of at the tail end of that generation of young scholars who were interested in the Nazi regime, and interested in the organizations of the Nazi regime, and also fascinated with the personnel files of the individuals, fascinated with the ideas of -- of motivate -- what made these people tick, and how did they operate as individuals and as an organization.</sentence><sentence id="166">And that spawned my interest in the SS, and my interest in doing a biography.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: Was -- was Hillberg's work important to you at that time, or not?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: It was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Hillberg's work came out in 1961 --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: -- and he was one of the earliest part of that generation.</sentence><sentence id="189">Hillberg had actually worked with the captured German records, analyzed as a document analyst in the late 40's and early 50's, and wrote his book based on that documentation before it was microfilmed, and you can tell that from the citations in his book, he still has the original file folder numbers there.</sentence><sentence id="190">And his book first came out in 1961 and by the time I was ready to get serious when I started <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in "68, a paperback version was out, and easily available even to a poor graduate student.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Right, right, that Bible -- that Bible-looking --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Yes, it was a Bible even then.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Right, yes.</sentence><sentence id="203">All right, so you get the call, and you obviously passed your kidney stone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: I did, not without difficulty, but I did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="208">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="209">So then what happened?</sentence><sentence id="210">What's the next -- what's the next step?</sentence><sentence id="211">Your --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Well basically I went in to the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of New York in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">south Manhattan</span>, was interviewed by an attorney there, and he gave me the information a -- his name was Tom Balout, was a lawyer from <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> who's long since gone into private practice.</sentence><sentence id="213">And he told me a little bit about the Maikovskis case, and about the problems with the Maikovskis case, and he explained to me that the members of the special litigation unit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span>, which had been formed the year earlier, 1977, and which had recently, in the spring of 1978 expanded to a staff of approximately four lawyers, two paralegals and one part- time historian, needed someone who was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, who could conduct research in the archives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the main one of which was the Yiddish institute for Jewish research, which at that time was located on the corner of East 81" Street, and I believe it was <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="216">A: And they had been canvassing a-around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for contacts, and one of the attorneys at the time, George Parker, had talked to my first advisor at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span>, Voytek Mastney, who was on a stint with Johns Hopkins at the time.</sentence><sentence id="217">And Mastney recom -- recommended me as a possibility, that's how they got my name.</sentence><sentence id="218">And I came in, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So did you go down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to talk with these folks, or did you s --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: No, I was hired from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, so -- okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: And I was based in the <span class="BUILDING">New York office</span> from -- from my start date in September "78, until shortly after the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was moved from the immigration service, was called the special litigation unit, under the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and it was moved into the criminal division in May, 1979.</sentence><sentence id="231">Six months after that I had already requested a transfer, and I requested also to be able to work pa -- full time.</sentence><sentence id="232">And they were interested in me, and they brought me down on January first, 1980.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: And by that time Ryan, Alan Ryan was -- was -- was OSI formed at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: OSI was for --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Was taken out of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="240">A: -- OSI was formed in May 1979, and -- under a temporary director, Walter Rockler, who had been a Nuremberg prosecutor.</sentence><sentence id="241">I believe -- I'm not sure, I believe he was a prosecutor in the Deutshe Bank case at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">And he was brought in by the criminal division to reorganize the special litigation unit, expand its staff, and deploy it effectively as a central agency to investigate and if necessary litigate all of the Nazi offender cases in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">Rockler was the director from September -- I'm sorry, he was the director from May 1979 until approximately March 1980.</sentence><sentence id="244">I believe it was a nine month detail, or a 10 month detail.</sentence><sentence id="245">And Ryan was brought on as the deputy sometime in -- he was there when I moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, so it must have been sometime in 1979.</sentence><sentence id="246">And then he -- he came -- Ryan came from the solicitor general's office in the Department of Justice, and he took over as director when Rockler withdrew and went back to private practice in March 1980.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="261">So tell me a little bit about this first case that you did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">What -- what -- what were they asking you to do?</sentence><sentence id="263">They were asking you to go to the <span class="BUILDING">archives</span> and find -- can you talk about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Well, they didn't -- they didn't really know what to ask me to do.</sentence><sentence id="269">They asked me to find evidence about this case, and I wasn't quite sure what they wanted me to do either, so I did -- what I did know how to do was go to then -- go to the published records, the Nuremberg trial records, and put together, I think it was about a 10 ora 15 or 20 page essay on the Latvian auxiliary police in -- in -- under German occupation in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="270"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maikovskis</span> was accused of having been a precinct chief in an eastern region of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rezekne</span>, Rossitten in German.</sentence><sentence id="271">And he had been accused of participating in killings of local Jews in the summer and autumn of 1941.And I went to some of the basic sources, there's a lengthy Nuremberg document which was written by the commander of the security police, in SD in the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span>, the former Einsatzgruppen chief, Walter Stahlecker, which was a lengthy report of about, oh, 250 pages dealing with the German occupation of the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span> and the operations of the police, in particular the auxiliary police.</sentence><sentence id="272">We also had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, copies of the Einsatzgruppen reports, which were on microfilm at the time, and I reviewed those and gathered the material that were relevant to Latvian auxiliary police killings of Jews and others in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> in the summer of 1941, and I put it together in a basic historical essay that I would write as a college paper at that time.</sentence><sentence id="273">This was before I had the PhD., and in fact it was at the time when I was writing the PhD.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="283">A: And the attorney was pleasantly surprised, and particularly by the speed in which it was gathered.</sentence><sentence id="284">It wasn't such a big thing to a historian, but it was obviously something that was very helpful to the attorney.</sentence><sentence id="285">And the reason for that was that the case had run into a snag.</sentence><sentence id="286">The original</sentence><sentence id="288">0 allegations had come from witnesses, primarily Israeli witnesses, who had Maikovskis little -- literally in every <span class="NPIP">location</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, killing people.</sentence><sentence id="289">And the U.S. attorneys had gone over to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> to take depositions of former Soviet -- Soviet Latvian citizens who had been Maikovskis's comrades, and who placed Maikovskis solely in one area of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, in <span class="REGION">southeastern Latvia</span> by Rezekne.</sentence><sentence id="290">And the judge in the case was extremely hostile to the idea of deporting someone for Nazi offenses.</sentence><sentence id="291">Not -- and th-th-there's no reason to believe that he was sympathetic to the Nazis, he just didn't like the idea of throwing someone out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on the basis of old evidence and evidence that had came in part from the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="292">And the judges hostility made it difficult for the attorneys to use the witness evidence, which, as it turned out, was a good thing for the Maikovskis case because the government eventually withdrew the charges against Maikovskis in the complaint, in -- in the order to show cause, Maikovskis was a alien, he wasn't a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="293">The -- the charges that placed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maikovskis</span> anywhere outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rezekne</span> were withdrawn, and the case then focused solely on what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rezekne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">And with a combination of documents in U.S. archives, which gave the general picture of what was going on in the Soviet -- in -- in -- in <span class="REGION">German occupied Latvia</span>, in that <span class="REGION">region</span>, and the statements, the depositions, complete with cross examination of Soviet witnesses -- that is Soviet citizens who had been comrades of Maikovskis, who described from their eyewitness point of view what had happened, enabled us to secure Maikovskis's order of deportation.</sentence><sentence id="295">If I remember correctly, we lost -- the judge was hostile enough to rule against us, but we won on appeal, at the board of immigration appeals.</sentence><sentence id="296">And Maikovskis eventually fled to <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> before he was actually deported.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="313">Q: Deported, I see.</sentence><sentence id="314">We -- do you know if he was ever tried in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="315">Or did he si --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: Th-The German -- the -- the Germans investigated Maikovskis, and here -- I'm not sure, I think they actually -- I'm not sure if they indicted him, but he was placed under investigation, and the investigation was still ongoing when he died.</sentence><sentence id="324">He was an older man, | think he was born in 1909, if I remember correctly.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: The -- this particular process, to not have it be a criminal prosecution, is this because of something in international law, or was this a decision the United States government made, not to make this a criminal proceeding, but rather to talk about willful misrepresentation, that someone misrepresented who they were, and we wouldn't have let them into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="388">Why not try these people for what they actually did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="391">A: I think there were a lot of factors involved in that.</sentence><sentence id="392">One clearly was, unlike the -- the Great Britain, which decided to go the criminal route, the Australians and the brit -- and the Canadians also decided, with total lack of success, to go the criminal proceedings route.</sentence><sentence id="393">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had a Constitution of 200 years, and to create a criminal jurisdiction for trying these cases in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, under criminal procedures would -- was, as I understand it, possible, but would have involved considerable difficulty, and considerable delay in setting up the apparatus.</sentence><sentence id="394">It also would have held the government to an extremely strict standard, as it did in the cases of <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, of proving potentially, an individual case of murder.</sentence><sentence id="395">The -- on the other hand, the immigration procedures were in place, and had been in place, particularly since many of the offenders had come in under the Displaced Persons Act, and the Refugee Relief Act of the -- the -- the legislation that was extant in the late 40's and early 50's.</sentence><sentence id="396">And there was legislation on the books already that if these applicants for immigration, and later for naturalization gave willful, false statements about their past, that they could be denaturalized, and ultimately deported.</sentence><sentence id="397">They would return to their pre-immigration status.</sentence><sentence id="398">That is, as an alien, which now the truth was known, was ineligible to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="399">And an ineligible alien</sentence><sentence id="401">4 face -- who is in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, faces deportation.</sentence><sentence id="402">U.S. immigration law, sometimes for many of the wrong reasons, is extremely harsh, and does not make many exceptions.</sentence><sentence id="403">And it was evidently decided -- this is not first-hand knowledge of -- of mine, it was evidently decided that this would be an appropriate process to deal with the issue of Nazi offenders living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">It was hoped, I think initially, that for many of these individuals, that the <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> where they had committed their offenses, would request their extradition.</sentence><sentence id="405">And in fact, there was some precedent for that.</sentence><sentence id="406">There was an outstanding request on the part of the former Yugoslav government, for the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich, since the early 50's.</sentence><sentence id="407">And in 1972, the West German government requested and obtained the extradition of a Long Island housewife named Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan, who had been a camp guard at the Lublin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek concentration camp</span>, and who had evaded justice afterwards, married an American serviceman, and had come over to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and who was sort of the epitome of the quiet neighbor that Allan Ryan tried to reflect in the title of his book in 1983.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: So there's some precedent for the idea that the nations on whose soil these individuals had committed their crimes, would want these people back in order to try them.</sentence><sentence id="429">And of course, we found -- we, that is the United States government, found very quickly that most of these <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span>, regardless of whether they made bellicose statements about dealing with Nazi offenders, were not terribly excited about having them back, and this is something that we found out quite quickly in the Trifa case, where the Romanians really had no interest in having Valerian at the time, Viarel Trifa back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to try him for anything.</sentence><sentence id="430">The <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> was often prepared to take people back in the 1970's and 1980's, but the United States government was not prepared at that time to send individuals back to the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: So this had to be somewhat frustrating, because th-the results are -- could be seen as kind of minimal.</sentence><sentence id="436">People could escape to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> if they were not extradited back to the original <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to be tried.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="437">A: Yeah, the opportunity to escape was quite available to anyone, particularly to citizens.</sentence><sentence id="438">There was no authority to the <span class="BUILDING">uni</span> -- for the United States government to imprison a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> during a denaturalization proceeding.</sentence><sentence id="439">The immigration and naturalization service can imprison an individual who is about to be ordered deported, and of whom it can be surmised that he will se -- seek to flee to avoid deportation.</sentence><sentence id="440">The INS can put someone in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">slammer</span> for that.</sentence><sentence id="441">But the United States government did not have the authority to imprison an individual who faced denaturalization proceedings.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="469">Q: I see, I see.</sentence><sentence id="470">Can you talk a -- a bit about how you understand the -- the law, starting with the Displaced Persons Act, and until you get to actually -- well, when is it, the Holzman amendment is in 1980 passing --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="471">A: Holzman amendment is passed, if I'm correct -- if I'm correct, it was passed in -- by Congress in 1978, and ratified in 1980.</sentence><sentence id="472">So it became effective in 1980.</sentence><sentence id="473">It really goes back to United States immigration policy at the end of World War II.</sentence><sentence id="474">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> clearly saw that it had been remiss -- the United States government at the time, and -- and -- and this was backed by popular support, that it had been remiss in granting sanctuary to refugees prior to World War II, and there was a concerted effort to provide special immigration legislation for refugees after World War II, that would exceed the narrowly restricted quotas which developed out of the 1924 Immigration and Naturalization Act.</sentence><sentence id="475">And the first of these special -- first of two -- actually three special laws, was the Displaced Persons Act, which was passed in 1948, and took effect from 1948 until the last day of 1952.</sentence><sentence id="476">And it created a separate category, over and above the quotas, of displaced persons who were eligible beyond the quotas to receive visas to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="483">And if memory serves me correct, some 400,000 people -- I think just under 400,000 people immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under the Displaced Persons Act from various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="484">There were -- the Displaced Persons Act also provided for the establishment of a DP</sentence><sentence id="486">7 commission, which operated in Europe and administered displaced person's camps to provide sanctuary for survivors of the Holocaust, refugees from Communist takeovers in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, and displaced persons uprooted by the Nazis during their occupation of <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> who could -- could not, or would not be repatriated, to give them a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they could find shelter and food, and in the case of kids, find some education and training, while they awaited the completion of the application process for a visa.</sentence><sentence id="487">When the Displaced Persons Act expired, the U.S. Congress, and again, backed by considerable public support, and this was -- keep in mind this was the time of the McCarthy era, despite the concerns with Communism, a refugee relief act was passed, which permitted further refugees, some of those who were ineligible under the Displaced Persons Act, to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on special visas that went over and beyond the numbers and the quotas.</sentence><sentence id="488">And these visas, the last big blup of visas, came in December 1956, and spilled over to January 1957 to accommodate the refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, from the Hungarian revolution of 1956.</sentence><sentence id="489">Now each of these decrees, each of these laws, as well as a 1945 regulation, if I remember correctly, there were increasingly less strict restrictions on eligibility to those who were either German, or received some benefit from the Nazi regime, or had collaborated with the Nazi regime.</sentence><sentence id="490">There was a regulation -- a -- a State Department regulation already in 1945, barring Nazi collaborators from coming into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">The Displaced Persons Act had fairly stringent restrictions on Nazi collaborators, those who assisted in persecution on the basis of race, religion and national origin, from entering the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">The Refugee Relief Act also had similar, except somewhat vaguer language, but still had language that excluded persons who personally participated in persecution from entering the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="493">Now, initially, as an example of how the legislation was relaxed in this aspect is the following; under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, SS membership rendered one ineligible</sentence><sentence id="495">8 from entering the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, regardless of what you had done in the SS -- what -- what an individual had done as a member of the SS.</sentence><sentence id="496">Membership in the SS alone, was enough to exclude from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">In -- under the amendment of 1950, which mems -- mere membership in the SS was no longer sufficient to exclude.</sentence><sentence id="498">One had to, as a member of the SS, have participated in persecution.</sentence><sentence id="499">The amendment in 1950 also allowed for nationals of, for instance, the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span> to enter as displaced persons, even if they had served in collaborative units, like the Latvian legion of the Waffen SS.</sentence><sentence id="500">Latvians could come before, through the Displaced Persons Act, but they can -- could not have been affiliated with Nazi organizations.</sentence><sentence id="501">Under the DP Act as amended, they were now no longer ineligible.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="528">A: -- about the membership, so as not to cut off an avenue of inquiry about their activities.</sentence><sentence id="529">So in other words it -- it remained against the law for a Latvian who had been a member of the Waffen SS to say that he was a bookkeeper during the war, when in fact he'd been a member of the Waffen SS, even if it had -- it w -- would later have been found that he had done nothing more than been a combat soldier.</sentence><sentence id="530">If he had admitted under the DP Act as amended that he was a Waffen SS combat soldier, and nothing more could be found against him, then he was eligible to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="531">But having concealed that information, that was already concealing, omitting, giving false statement, to obtain a federal benefit, which --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="532">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="533">A: -- brought a whole other exclusionary process to bear.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="538">Q: So, before we get to the -- the -- the next amendment, why do you think they made this change?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: I-I'm sure there were many factors involved.</sentence><sentence id="540">The one that comes to mind is that there was a -- a shortage of agricultural labor in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and a lot of the east European refugees from Communism were farmers, and farmer's sons.</sentence><sentence id="541">And the -- and al -- and many of them were also ethnic Germans from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="542">And I have no doubt that the idea of providing sanctuary to individuals who were escaping Communist regimes was a significant factor in amending the Displaced Persons Act.</sentence><sentence id="543">There was also a feeling even at the time that for those who served in combat units that were affiliated with Nazi Germany, that particularly for Ukrainians, for members of the Baltic states, whose annexation by the Soviet Union the United States never recognized, that these people had had very bad choices, and that the one that they chose was only marginally less worse than the -- the other that was available to them.</sentence><sentence id="544">And so I think i -- th -- a combination of factors led to the amendment of the Displaced Persons Act, and also led to the -- the slight differences in the Refugee Relief Act.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="551">Q: And so then what is the next change that happens?</sentence><sentence id="552">Is it --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="553">A: After -- after the Refugee Relief Act expired, at the end of -- in 1952, and a new Immigration and Naturalization Act had been passed, which was slightly less restrictive, and here I'm -- here I'm speaking off the top of my head -- slightly less restrictive than the "24 act, but it was a quota act again.</sentence><sentence id="554">And that came back into force, and remained in force until 1986 or "96, the new immigration act -- the new immigration act, I think it was 1996, replaced the "52 act.</sentence><sentence id="555">Under these acts, all of these acts, the "52 act in particular, but also the other special immigration legislation, that an individual who was ordered deported, could apply for what was called discretionary relief, for a number of reasons, whether they've been a good citizen, and they were -- when they</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="561">0 -- while they lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, if their wi -- were married to <span class="COUNTRY">US</span>.</sentence><sentence id="562">citizens, if they had children who were US.</sentence><sentence id="563">citizens, if they had close relatives who were dependent on them who were USS.</sentence><sentence id="564">citizens.</sentence><sentence id="565">And another very important and applicable one in these cases, if by deportation to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from whence they came, they would be subjected to political persecution.</sentence><sentence id="566">And this was a particularly applicable part of the statute for the Communist regimes, and was applied in the case of the former Croat Minister of the Interior, Andrea Artukovich who came in the -- into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under a false name, was clearly involved in persecution.</sentence><sentence id="567">He came even before the DP act, he came under the 1924 act, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="568">And he was actually ordered deported in 1953 at the conclusion of a proceeding, but the order of deportation was stayed because he was successfully able to argue that he would be persecuted in a Communist Yugoslavia, and would not get a fair trial.</sentence><sentence id="569">And this very much stems from the -- the -- the Cold War atmosphere of the time, and this was an atmosphere that continued affecting the few cases that actually were prosecuted, or were litigated during the 50's and 60's, until the Vietnam era.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="583">And what was the change with the Holzman Amendment?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="586">A: The Holzman Amendment, which was passed in 1978 radically changed this in that for persons who participated in persecution on the basis of race, religion, national origin and political opinion, they added political opinion under Holzman, under the aegis of Nazi Germany or its allies, or in territories occupied by Nazi Germany between January 30", 1933, and May eighth, 1945, if found to be deportable, if found to be ineligible to enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, could not apply for discretionary relief on any basis.</sentence><sentence id="587">And so this there -- this therefore opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> for an actual result to these cases, you didn't have to go through the litigation only to find that the individual could apply for and get discretionary relief, either because his children were U.S.citizens, or because he could claim political persecution from a Communist country.</sentence><sentence id="588">Now, did it</sentence><sentence id="590">1 mean that we were -- we, the U.S. government were willing to deport these people just to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, as a practice?</sentence><sentence id="591">Not yet, but at least legally the possibility was there to obtain an order of deportation and actually carry it out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="601">Q: And the Cold War is still going on, so what allowed Holzman's amendment to actually be passed when people still had a very -- I don't know, shall we call it a rigid view, or at least a Cold War view of <span class="REGION">eastern European countries</span> under the Soviet Union?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: Again, I think it was a combination of factors.</sentence><sentence id="604">Clearly important was the precedent of the Braunsteiner-Ryan case in 1972, which sparked questions about how many other Nazi criminals were living in our midst, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="605">And that created a certain degree of public pressure, in part from Jewish groups, and survivor groups, which unlike 1945 - 1950, where they were immigrants with no -- no confidence to say what they wanted, and no strong desire to relive the immediate past as opposed to dealing with creating a new life and a future, were now established USS.</sentence><sentence id="606">citizens, quite conscious and aware of their rights to lobby congressmen, to get some results on this.</sentence><sentence id="607">A second key factor was the development of a -- the process of detente between the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>.</sentence><sentence id="608">The year that Braunsteiner-Ryan was extradited, 1972, was also the year that President Nixon visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and ushered in the era of detente, which lasted more or less until the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.</sentence><sentence id="609">This was also a time at which we in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and to a greater degree, prosecutors in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> were beginning to see glimpses of the types of usable evidence, credible evidence that existed behind the iron curtain.</sentence><sentence id="610">In the 50's this stuff just was not available in any way.</sentence><sentence id="611">In the 60's, particularly in the early 60's, trickles of documentary material captured by the Red army, came into the public domain through west German trials, and also through Soviet propaganda pamphlets in the late 60's and early 70's, denouncing the western powers for harboring Nazi criminals.</sentence><sentence id="612">Now the pamphlets were --</sentence><sentence id="614">2 were -- were nonsense, and -- and often many of the statements in the pamphlets were nonsense, as well as the interpretations.</sentence><sentence id="615">But the documents that were photocopied, if genuine, and one couldn't tell if they were genuine unless they subjected -- subjected them to careful forensic testing, were not only interesting in themselves, but fascinating as examples of the type of material that had survived the war, and that was in Soviet hands.</sentence><sentence id="616">One of the key driving forces behind the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of special investigation's success, was an early agreement in 1980 with the Soviet Union to take videotaped depositions from Soviet citizens, all of whom were comrades of the defendants in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and of whom, while it might be questioned what kinds of pressures they were in the Soviet Union, it couldn't be questioned that they knew the defendants involved, whereas with the survivor witnesses, defense attorneys could raise questions as to how they could possibly know that this was the man who did this, that and the other thing.</sentence><sentence id="617">The comrades who worked with them on a daily basis, and who may have known them from their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometowns</span> couldn't be questioned.</sentence><sentence id="618">They -- their knowledge of the defendants as members of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> was much more credible, even if it was coming from behind the <span class="DLF">Iron Curtain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="619">We also were unable at that time to get unrestricted access to Soviet records, but we were able to get access to copies of documentation, at least pertaining to our defendants at that time, and in response to the general objection of the defense that these documents were always forged by the Soviet Union, the Soviet authorities quickly understood that in order for the United States government to be credible, that they would have to fork over the originals.</sentence><sentence id="620">And this started already in 1980 - 1981, where the Soviet authorities would have the original document sent to the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet embassy</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Soviet consulate</span>, depending on where the trial was taking place, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, where the document could then be examined by the government's forensics examiners for handwriting, for paper, for typing quality, for signatures.</sentence><sentence id="621">And also by teams hired</sentence><sentence id="623">3 by the defense.</sentence><sentence id="624">And at no time did the Soviets ever represent to OSI that a document was genuine when it was not genuine.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1603">A: -- the expert offers evidence -- excuse me -- on what the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> did, o-on the big picture, first of all, so we --

sequence as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="1606">And then going down as far as the documentation permits the expert to make a judgment.</sentence><sentence id="1607">For instance, if the expert sees a month's worth of guard rotation assignments at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, that expert can talk about those rotations, because he's seen enough evidence to

let me retract that.</sentence><sentence id="1609">If there's -- if we don't have the daily rotations, but only have evidence of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> within the system, then the expert, if he feels so comfortable in doing so, can talk about how -- what the normal routine was within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> system, and how in his expert opinion there's no reason to assume that for this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, it went any way differently.</sentence><sentence id="1610">He cannot -- or I wouldn't, as an expert witness, try to get into the detail as to who was rotated where at what time, or even what the specific places of rotation were.</sentence><sentence id="1611">That you'd have to do on the basis of the evidence.</sentence><sentence id="1612">You can't know that if you don't have the -- i-if -- if there's a gap in that documentation.</sentence><sentence id="1613">And for instance, to give you an example, in the Schellong case, we didn't have that documentation for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1614">We only knew that he was a security officer, and we knew that there were regular functions for security officers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration

case might have been.</sentence><sentence id="1619">For instance in the Hajda case, we could talk because we had, through a three tiered level of documentation, contemporaneous documentation of individuals who were in the Trawniki system, and who served at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span></sentence><sentence id="1621">0 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, individuals who after the war testified in <span class="REGION">western countries</span>, where there was -- where you didn't have the baggage of what the Soviet system was like, that they had indeed been there, and done this, that and the other thing, and then of course, the Soviet protocols, in so far as the information contained therein was consistent with the original documentation, and the testimony in the western protocols.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And through a s -- a combination of those three types of sources, we were able to identify where virtually every single individual who served at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka labor camp</span> between March 1943, and its dissolution in July 1944, where they were.</sentence><sentence id="1623">We were able even to determine what happened to the people who appeared on one roster and were no longer on the other roster.</sentence><sentence id="1624">One was sent back because he was a chronic drunk, and we had documentation -- his own testimony in that case, that he became an alcoholic at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one.</sentence><sentence id="1625">A post-war testimony in a German

deserted and was being sought at a time between the dates of the two rosters.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And so the expert was able to speak in significant detail about who was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one, when, and what they were doing there; and in a way that was very convincing to the judge.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1879">A: And -- and in a sense that's really what it was, it was an issue -- the expert had to be an expert, had to be comfortable enough with the data to be able to get up there and speak with confidence.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And you can't just, in my experience -- and I worked well with all of the experts that I worked with, the one I worked with most often was a gentleman named Charlie Sidmore, and I</sentence><sentence id="1882">8 worked with him in the Hajda case, as you saw from the transcript.</sentence><sentence id="1883">But it -- it had to -- there had to be enough knowledge, enough familiarity with the material on the part of the expert, which meant the expert really had to do some work, and independent work, so that he could get up on the stand and feel really comfortable about what he was saying and even if he did make a mistake, which we're all human and we do make a mistake, that we could make sure that it was cleared up on a follow-up question, or on redirect examination, if the mistake was made on cross examination.</sentence><sentence id="1884">Cause the -- the -- the nature of these cases, and the level at which the information was relevant -- most historians deal with the upper levels of an agency, and where we were dealing with people on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> that are -- is generally not of much historical -- broader historical significance, given the complexity of the documentation, experts would forget this or that, or the other thing, and a follow-up question was often all one needed to trigger off what the expert already knew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1893">Q: I'm interested to hear what happens to you when you're an expert witness, and I'm wondering if you can comment on this.</sentence><sentence id="1894">Most people you have as expert witnesses are academics, I imagine, of -- of some kind.</sentence><sentence id="1895">Am I right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1899">A: All have an academic background.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1903">A: All are trained as academics.</sentence><sentence id="1904">We had at least one expert witness who was not -- did not hold a university position in the most recent 10 years of his career, but he continued to be academically active.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1907">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1912">A: In other words, they were all experts in the sense that they continued to work with primary source documents, they continued to write history, they continued to analyze documentation, and they kept up on the latest research in the <span class="DLF">field</span> in which they were expert.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1914">Q: Is it uncomfortable in some ways for academics to do it in a court setting, because ambiguity is not what you're looking for, you're loo -- you're looking for a very specific kind of clarity.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1916">Now maybe it's my bias, because I was a philosopher, being -- living with ambiguity is sort of the rule, and maybe as an historian that's not quite as true, but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1917">A: | -- I think -- i-it's been my experience, at least from what I've observed with experts on the stand, that there are times when the moo -- th-the rules of the <span class="INT_SPACE">courtroom</span>, as to what gets in, what -- what -- what doesn't get in, can be frustrating to the effort to explain the context of a situation.</sentence><sentence id="1918">But I noticed in -- and I'm thinking of at least two or three expert witnesses, who were able to overcome quickly, that discomfort and work with the rules of -- of evidence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1921">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1923">A: And in a sense, 1-it just requires you to know your material very, very well.</sentence><sentence id="1924">To get a sense of the dynamic of the questioning.</sentence><sentence id="1925">To not be flustered by interruptions by the defense, because the defense attorney's job is to try to disrupt as much as possible, the train of thought of the expert, and to try to -- even the most decent of defense attorneys -- to try to catch the expert witnesses -- witness, in errors of fact or interpretation that would serve to undermine his whole testimony.</sentence><sentence id="1926">And those experts who accepted that, were competent enough in their material not to get flustered by those interruptions and kept going back and kept listening to, and following the direction of the questions, usually got most of what the -- they intended to say, out.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1936">A: And in -- in -- in that sense, the expert testimony, taken together with the trial record offered a fairly good picture of the history of this particular defendant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1938">Q: Now what about the use of survivor testimonies, or I don't know how you call them, other kinds of witnesses, they're not considered expert witnesses, but experiential witnesses.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1940">A: Eyewitnesses, in a sense.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1942">Q: Eyewitness, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1944">A: W-We use two types -- actually three types of eyewitnesses.</sentence><sentence id="1945">There were two -- there was a traditional type of eyewitness, whether it was a survivor, or a fellow perpetrator who actually saw specific events at hand.</sentence><sentence id="1946">We also used, a-a-and in this case survivor witnesses who may not have probably i-in many cases, most cases, didn't know the defendant, had no idea what the defendant did, but could talk in general about what his or her perception of what the guards were doing was, and also more important, what life was like.</sentence><sentence id="1947">There's no one, no book, no perpetrator testimony, no historian can possibly get across with the same intensity as a survivor talking, what it felt like to the survivor.</sentence><sentence id="1948">And it -- when the survivor talks, in that sense, if one ac-accepts the testimony as being no more than what it is, that survivor's memory, some of the inaccuracies that inevitably come up in human memory, even when they can't be reconciled with an explanation, still don't detract from the image of what life was like in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, or in a <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting to be shot at a <span class="DLF">pit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1949">That this is something that -- this kind of testimony lends an immediacy that the dry documentation just can't give.</sentence><sentence id="1950">But it also is less immu -- less vulnerable to attack than testimony, I saw him do it, because that raises all sorts of questions of how the witness knew who he was.</sentence><sentence id="1951">And remember, he was most often wearing a uniform, and a cap, and looked pretty much like the next him and the next him after that.</sentence><sentence id="1952">And how does this witness remember this particular person as opposed to anyone else?</sentence><sentence id="1953">And in a trial with a dynamic where</sentence><sentence id="1955">1 the defense attorney has the opportunity and must have the opportunity to question that witness's memory, to try to trip that witness, to try to ask questions, well isn't it possible that you could be mistaken?</sentence><sentence id="1956">How do you really know that it was this person and not someone else?</sentence><sentence id="1957">And in that ki - - type of dynamic, that kind of testimony, unless there was some reason for the survivor witness to have known the man, the way you would -- the way you would judge the credibility of any eyewitness, in any criminal case, the eyewitnesses -- the survivor testimony was often much more effective to give a picture of the climate of persecution, to offer evidence as to the identity of the people who are being persecuted through their own persons.</sentence><sentence id="1958">This was stuff that they knew.</sentence><sentence id="1959">This was stuff that they would not be mistaken about and could not be mistaken about.</sentence><sentence id="1960">Then we had a third type of witness, we had to develop how the process of certifying refugees, and how the refugees applied for visas, we had to establish that particular process.</sentence><sentence id="1961">And we did that by locating individuals who had actually worked on those processes.</sentence><sentence id="1962">In other words, displaced persons -- officials from the <span class="BUILDING">displaced persons commission</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1963">Officials from the counter- intelligence corps, state department visa officials.</sentence><sentence id="1964">In -- in -- I -- I can't remember a single case frankly, where any one of these officials remembered the specific case that they were asked to testify.</sentence><sentence id="1965">Well, after all, during the DP act there were 400,000 visas.</sentence><sentence id="1966">That meant 400,000 investigations and 400,000 pre-application interviews.</sentence><sentence id="1967">And no reasonable individual could be expected to remember one person as opposed to another, particularly if there wasn't a -- a specific hooker about that -- that case.</sentence><sentence id="1968">But what we could ask them about was what was the regular procedure?</sentence><sentence id="1969">Did you swear it was -- was -- was the applicant required to swear to the truth of what he was saying?</sentence><sentence id="1970">What did the applicant need in order to become eligible to be a displaced person, to receive a visa?</sentence><sentence id="1971">What were the exclusionary measures?</sentence><sentence id="1972">How were they implemented?And in that way, the witness could take -- offer the judge testimony on how things actually</sentence><sentence id="1974">2 worked.</sentence><sentence id="1975">And we used those witnesses -- the OSI used those witnesses to introduce documentation regulations of the international refugee organization, regulations of the d -- Displaced Persons Commission.</sentence><sentence id="1976">Visa regulations, advisory reports and what have you, that were relevant to the process of how a displaced person entered the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and what information he was required to offer about his person in order to complete his application.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2017">A: Hajda, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2019">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hajda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2020">In the Hajda case you had two survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>, who interestingly enough could mention the names of two other guards, but of course did not know -- Hajda was -- was interesting, and th-the emphasis on the testimony was apparently not very much.</sentence><sentence id="2021">There was an argument about inclusion of the testimony and the judge agreed to include it, but then didn't use it very much in the final decision.</sentence><sentence id="2022">And so, was it to give it a -- a taste of what this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was like, so that one could make a connection between what Hajda must have been doing, had he been there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2027">A: | -- I -- I think the judge wanted to hear that.</sentence><sentence id="2028">And -- a-and that certainly was the purpose of those witness -- they couldn't say anything about Hajda personally, neither of them, as I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2029">They -- they -- even though it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, there were only roughly a hundred, 120 guards there at any one time.</sentence><sentence id="2030">I-In that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the -- the commandant was a psychopath who often personally took pleasure in torturing individual prisoners, so he was a person who was fairly well known, even by name, to the prisoners of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="2031">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span> too, there were under a thousand people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> under a thousand Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2032">And there was one guard, a particularly cruel guard, who had the bad luck to have a patch over his eye.</sentence><sentence id="2033">And so he was remembered, not necessarily by name, but they all remembered the one with</sentence><sentence id="2035">3 the patch over his eye, and that's natural.</sentence><sentence id="2036">And in fact, the one with the patch over his eye, bad as he was, often got blamed for virtually everything because a -- a -- a -- a survivor witness, in remembering bad things that happened also remembered the guy with the patch over his eye, and that the guy with the patch over his eye was a bad guy, and so the connection was made.</sentence><sentence id="2037">And in many cases they were right, and in some cases they weren't right.</sentence><sentence id="2038">But Hajda was just one guard among many and it -- in -- in that case it was very typical of the survivor's relationship to the normal -- normal in quotes -- prisoner guar -- the normal guard, that he was a person in a uniform, that unless there was some reason to know him on a daily basis, like a prisoner worked in a <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> and the guard commonly came to the <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> to get his boots fixed, there was some relationship that was ongoing.</sentence><sentence id="2039">But just a guard on the perimeter was someone that the witness, after 40 years, couldn't be expected -- it wouldn't be fair to burden the witness with trying to remember that particular person.</sentence><sentence id="2040">And so in this particular case it was made easy for us because the defendant stipulated to all of the horrors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka one camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2473">A: The case that would have had to have been made would have been the case that he was training these men to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guards, and this is what it means to be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> guard.</sentence><sentence id="2474">And that would, in our estimation when we brought the case, would constitute participation in persecution, or assistance in persecution.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2569">Q: And the Hajda case is an interesting --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2570">A: The Hajda case was significant for me for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="2571">Three reasons, really.</sentence><sentence id="2572">It was the first case that I as a historian with the attorney, the partner this time was someone I -- one of my very best and closest friends in the off -- in the OSI, Ned Stuttman.</sentence><sentence id="2573">This was the first case that we had actually gone to trial with using primarily evidence that came as a result of the collapse of the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2574">This case was built, not exclusively, but at least three-quarters -- 75 percent of the evidence was evidence that was taken from witnesses, or found in documentation that had been held behind the Iron Curtain since 1945.</sentence><sentence id="2575">And it also represented our first, as an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, our first extensive use of post-war Soviet</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="2585">2 protocols, of witness interrogations, where we no longer had the witness alive to be cross- examined.</sentence><sentence id="2586">And we used them very, very carefully in that we didn't accept them all at face value.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2587">We were up front about our doubts about the conditions under which this testimony was taken.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2588">We were also up front about the possibility that Soviet investigators at that time had specific information that was going into that protocol whether the witness said it or not.</sentence><sentence id="2589">But we used them where the evidence contained in them was consistent with documentation, whether it was testimony given in the west, or captured German documentation, either captured by the western powers or by the Soviets, where the information was consistent, we could regard this evidence in the protocols as cooperative evidence.</sentence><sentence id="2590">In other words, it didn't stand alone, but just because it was protocols taken, quite frankly, by Soviet intelligence agents, didn't mean necessarily that we as investigators could, a priori say this is all phony, this is all fake.</sentence><sentence id="2591">We had to look at that evidence the way any historian -- and here in a sense the lawyers went the way of the historians, the way any historian looks at any evidence, with no a priori preconceptions, a priori suspicions but testing those elements of the testimony that made good historical sense, and being aware of those elements of the testimony which one should rightfully have doubts about.</sentence><sentence id="2592">And I can give you an example.</sentence><sentence id="2593">There were statements of former Treblinka guards, who identified Hajda, and there was a whole issue, as you probably saw, about the spelling of Hajda, because the Polish -- the s -- the -- the sound of Hajda, there's no H in Russian, and the interrogations were always in Russian.</sentence><sentence id="2594">There's no H. The Russians replace H with the Cyrillic equivalent of the --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2595">Q: G.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2596">A: -- the English, or the Roman G, and so it was always Gajda, and there were any variation of Gajda, it could be G-a-i-d-a. It could be G-a-y-d-a, it could be G-a-y apostrophe d-a. And there was any number of variations of that.</sentence><sentence id="2597">And then of course there were the <span class="DLF">obvio</span> -- the -- the</sentence><sentence id="2599">3 misspellings, and the mistranslations, and the -- the misspellings in the translation.</sentence><sentence id="2600">But there were certain testimonies that identified Hajda as a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="2601">Now the Russians -- the Soviets didn't have Hajda.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Hajda was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, they didn't have him.</sentence><sentence id="2603">He was only of interest to them in that he was a name, another identification.</sentence><sentence id="2604">There's no evidence that they even knew that he was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, although the Soviets knew about many of the emigres who were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2605">There was no interest because he was Polish, and because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was also a Communist country, that the Soviets were interested in extraditing him.</sentence><sentence id="2606">But there were some witnesses who testified that Hajda was a Pole, even though most of the rest of the people -- a Pole was an anomaly among the Trawniki men.</sentence><sentence id="2607">There were very small Polish recruiting drives, and there were only two of them who ever served at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one, two Poles.</sentence><sentence id="2608">And not every witness said Hajda was a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="2609">If every witness had said Hajda was a Pole, then one would have been suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="2610">If every witness had gotten the first name right, one would be suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="2611">But some of them got the first name, some didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2612">Some got the wrong first name.</sentence><sentence id="2613">Some didn't remember a first name at all, they just remembered a g -- a Hajda who was a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="2614">And ina group of a hundred guards, that is more credible.</sentence><sentence id="2615">On the other hand, you would get testimonies where the Soviet interrogator was clearly asking to identify what people were involved in the massacre of the surviving Jewish prisoners when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was evacuated in July 1944.</sentence><sentence id="2616">And there you'd have a list of 40 names.</sentence><sentence id="2617">So and so -- I know so and so participated in the murder of 350 prisoners on the day that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="2618">The next guy would -- the s -- the exact same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2619">The next guy would the exact same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2620">And then you get Hajda's name, the exact same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2621">As a historian, I tended to discount.</sentence><sentence id="2622">Didn't mean that Hajda didn't participate, but I discounted that evidence as something that Soviet interrogators were interested in getting it because of the r -- the repeated question, it was just plugging a name into this statement, that they</sentence><sentence id="2624">4 wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2625">It was the oddities, the things that were different, that could be corroborated by other evidence, and Hajda's Polish origins were corroborated by personnel documents, and his place of birth.</sentence><sentence id="2626">That could be used in these statements.</sentence><sentence id="2627">We, in prosecuting the case, never charged that Hajda personally participated in the killings.</sentence><sentence id="2628">We did charge that he was there at the time the killings happened, and we did describe, as you read, in -- in some detail, what the guards, the hundred of them, you know, there were a hundred, hundred and 10, were doing while these killings were taking place.</sentence><sentence id="2629">So the judge had the data to make a judgment that well, we don't know what Hajda was doing, but we know he was participating in some way, because guards weren't sitting around.</sentence><sentence id="2630">They were all doing one thing, either guarding the people who were guarding the perimeter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> while the people were being taken out to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in groups to be shot, guarding those who were left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> while the rest were being taken out to be shot, escorting groups to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, or actually shooting them.</sentence><sentence id="2631">It was one of those things, all the guards were involved in that because that's what they were doing on that day.</sentence><sentence id="2632">And that was based on the Soviet protocols, and the primary source documentation.</sentence><sentence id="2633">And we were able to prove that Hajda was there because of a group of documents from the successor unit of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trawniki training camp</span>, the Battalion Streibel.</sentence><sentence id="2634">There was a group of 20 men, all still working with the commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one, who as well was evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="2635">Every one of those 20 men were on rosters at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> one.</sentence><sentence id="2636">So it made no sense, it made no common sense, this was a common sense issue for Hajda not to have been there at the time of the killings, and still be on that post- evacuation roster with 20 other men who are all at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> throughout, from 1943 through its evacuation in 1944.</sentence></p></dialogue>
