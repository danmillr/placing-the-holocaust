<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="513">A: No, I'm sure that whatever records -- and they did have some records, I'm sure that others could tell you about this, like Colonel Case was our chaplain and he did a lot of this.</sentence><sentence id="514">Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> could tell you this, because they certainly got what information they could from them.</sentence><sentence id="515">And names and numbers, if they had any numbers.</sentence><sentence id="516">But I'm sure a lot of them didn't even have names or numbers and probably couldn't remember.</sentence><sentence id="517">I know that there were -- I think more Polish, maybe they were Polish Jewish, I don't know, than there were actually just Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="518">You see, this was quite awhile after the Holocaust, really.</sentence><sentence id="519">The Holocaust started in what, *42?
