<body><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1">A: I think so, but I wouldn't know for sure.</sentence><sentence id="2">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> I would say that was not necessarily the case.</sentence><sentence id="3">But I really don't remember, I remember only really family from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">I don't remember any children from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or acquaintances of my parents.</sentence><sentence id="5">For that matter I wouldn't know what their religion was.</sentence><sentence id="6">So, I really can't answer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: And then another question from a different <span class="NPIP">time</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">When you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, I believe you mentioned in the first interview that before your family was actually caught in a round-up and deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, you had been caught in another round-up and somehow managed to get out.</sentence><sentence id="15">Now that wasn't clear to me from the first interview what had happened during that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: I don't remember whether I was picked up at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or off the <span class="DLF">street</span> and taken to a collection point where we were supposed to have been deported somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="20">And I walked away from it, and wasn't challenged in the process and got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: So it was just you?</sentence><sentence id="24">It wasn't members of your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="27">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="28">I think it was just me, that's right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: And what happened the second time when your whole family was deported?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: The second time they, as they always did, they came in the middle of the night and you had five minutes to get dressed and get your, your bags were always packed because you knew it could happen.</sentence><sentence id="34">And you were hauled off in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> along with other people, taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">Put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> not knowing where to.</sentence><sentence id="36">And then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, which was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> that the Germans had established; it's in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">And we were held there for about six months.</sentence><sentence id="38">I don't think there were any other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">deportations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">There may have been one or two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> before we were hauled out.</sentence><sentence id="40">And I think the general impression was that they were going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">Why I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="42">But... never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> before.</sentence><sentence id="43">As a matter of fact, we were one of the earliest ones in there.</sentence><sentence id="44"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span> was... I'm not sure if it was on a previous tape or not.</sentence><sentence id="45">When we got there, of course it was a very large <span class="BUILDING">facility</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">Part of it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian POW camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">But obviously designed for officers, because they had little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> and gravel walks between them and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="48">And then there were two sections to the non-POW prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="49">One was for, called criminals and the second section was for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="50">And as they started to fill up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> there were a number of trainfuls of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, a lot of Hungarians, French women.</sentence><sentence id="51">They were the wives of officers who were POW's from the French Army.</sentence><sentence id="52">And then after the, in "44, after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, a lot of Libyan Jews that Rommel had shipped off to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they had been held in camps in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and apparently under Red Cross supervision.</sentence><sentence id="53">They all had British uniforms and heavy British, woolen coats and the like, and lots of good food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Yeah, you did talk some about that in the first interview.</sentence><sentence id="76">When you were heading towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, did you know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> before you arrived?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="81">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 4</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="82">A: No, never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">And of course, you know, it's maybe a two hour <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride at most.</sentence><sentence id="84">No, never heard of it before, at least I hadn't, I don't know whether my parents ever had.</sentence><sentence id="85">No idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="90">Q: Did you have any idea at the time of what had started to happen to Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="92">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="93">They always said we'd be relocating in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="94">Or vague promises of exchanging for money, that relatives, particularly in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> could buy you and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="95">But no, nobody had any inkling of what lay ahead in terms of the violence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: And you talked in some detail about what you remembered of your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and that you had been, you had contracted polio.</sentence><sentence id="101">Had you really recovered from the symptoms of that by the time that you were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="104">A: I would say so.</sentence><sentence id="105">The problem that I had were primarily with the right knee and I still have some problems with that knee.</sentence><sentence id="106">But I was spared the recurrence that apparently happened to older people when it was discovered in the last ten or 15 years or so.</sentence><sentence id="107">It must have been a fairly mild case even though polio, of course back then was rampant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="112">Q: Tell me if, I have an impression, and tell me if it's correct.</sentence><sentence id="113">I have the impression that your family was fairly close-knit and that you're weren't necessarily forming strong bonds with other people outside of your family.</sentence><sentence id="114">Is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: Yeah, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="119">I don't think anybody formed any bonds at all.</sentence><sentence id="120">It was a matter of survival and I don't mean to imply that you tried it at the expense of somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="121">But once we realized, I'm not sure we really realized, but when it became a matter of trying to survive, you didn't and a fellow that was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> either with you or next to you may not wake up in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="122">Nobody really tried to get attached to anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="123">You didn't form any bonds other than to, you didn't try to antagonize anybody, but there wasn't any real friendships or relationships of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="124">Well, there really wasn't much time either.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Do you remember, was there kind of a gradual sense of deepening horror and insecurity or was there a moment when you really, that you remember having been really, realized what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: No, it was, that was, in a way the tragedy was that it was a gradual tightening of the noose, so to speak, in that... I remember the first two days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>, there was so much food we couldn't eat it.</sentence><sentence id="135">There was no nutrition, but a liter of soup, even if it was only a liter of warm water with nothing in it.</sentence><sentence id="136">You're not used to drinking a liter of volume, a quart.</sentence><sentence id="137">It took two days and you ate it all and were hungry.</sentence><sentence id="138">And then the amount of food that you got kept getting less and less.</sentence><sentence id="139">And initially there were, the guards kept changing constantly and surprisingly they kept getting more and more vicious rather than less so.</sentence><sentence id="140">The last group which maybe was there for a year, year and a half, I don't recall for sure for how long, were World War One veterans who were too old or too feeble or had been wounded.</sentence><sentence id="141">But they were not suitable for frontline service in the German Army.</sentence><sentence id="142">And you would think that they would be not so hateful.</sentence><sentence id="143">And they weren't maybe the first 4</sentence><sentence id="145">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 5 week, but they got there very quickly, got to be pretty vicious.</sentence><sentence id="146">And I'm not sure whether they were told to or it was a natural progression as the sensitivities wore off.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: So even as a young child you grew somehow hardened to this experience would you say?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Well you had to if you wanted to survive.</sentence><sentence id="164">You couldn't, it wasn't that you wouldn't help somebody up if they had fallen, but you had to be very careful.</sentence><sentence id="165">Yes, you probably were...maybe more encapsulated than hardened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Do you remember private conversations that you were able to have with your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: None, absolutely none.</sentence><sentence id="173">I don't really remember very much.</sentence><sentence id="174">You remember the weird things but not the everyday.</sentence><sentence id="175">And I'm sure that others would have remembered something totally different that I don't even remember happening.</sentence><sentence id="176">Like that Easter Sunday, the fighter attack.</sentence><sentence id="177">Well, because of it, one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that got shot up was the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">And one thing the Germans had were cans of beef in its own juice.</sentence><sentence id="179">And apparently some of those got bullet-riddled so they had to use them right away.</sentence><sentence id="180">For a couple of days we actually got food, but then they made up for it for a long time with nothing, because the food was gone again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Do you remember the day that you were deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>?</sentence><sentence id="191">Anything about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: No, nothing in particular.</sentence><sentence id="195">They, I guess in the afternoon the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was pushed into, the empty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was pushed into the compound.</sentence><sentence id="196">It was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">Then they posted names, they called them out and you had to be there whenever, an hour or so later.</sentence><sentence id="198">Got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, nobody knew where it was going to go.</sentence><sentence id="199">Supposedly it was just a relocation and they always promised you something better.</sentence><sentence id="200">Of course it never was.</sentence><sentence id="201">But particularly initially you didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="202">And I guess they had to, that I'm sure explains why there was no really massive resistance.</sentence><sentence id="203">If you knew you were going to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> you may as well try and fight it.</sentence><sentence id="204">So you get shot on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="205">I think that's why there's, the general docility of the deportees.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: Had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> been leaving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> for some time before yours left?</sentence><sentence id="219">In other words, were you...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: We were not the first ones, but yes, but I don't know whether we were the third or fifth or tenth.</sentence><sentence id="223">But yes, there had been others.</sentence><sentence id="224">And of course you never got any feedback in terms of where they went or how they were treated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: So, you may have had the sense then that at any point your name could be called and you'd be getting on the...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Yes, yes, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="231">Yeah, I think it was generally recognized that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transit camp</span> and not a permanent installation.</sentence><sentence id="232">So, I think so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: And about your time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span>, I'm sorry, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">You were there relatively early as you just mentioned.</sentence><sentence id="238">And I wondered if in the long term you feel that having been there 5</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="244">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 6 early on enabled you to, or was an advantage as far as... you did mention that it was an advantage as far as food.</sentence><sentence id="245">But I wondered if your resistance was stronger and if you knew the system better?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Well system, there was really no system.</sentence><sentence id="247">But yeah, I think so, because the people who came very late, particularly if they did not come from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but straight from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="248">They were plunged from a normal diet to 200, 300, whatever it was, calories a day.</sentence><sentence id="249">And I think they died faster than those of us who, even though they may have had physical, physically more reserves than we did, who our reserves were spent.</sentence><sentence id="250">But we may have been a little bit more cautious.</sentence><sentence id="251">And also we were so disease-ridden and I don't know whether our immune systems had strengthened.</sentence><sentence id="252">Those are medical issues that I don't know about.</sentence><sentence id="253">People who were plunged into this diarrhea, flea, lice, you know all the vermin.</sentence><sentence id="254">They could not tolerate it as much as those of us who were exposed to it more slowly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: To what extent did you have contact with the other members of your family while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: We saw them almost every day.</sentence><sentence id="267">My dad and my brother and I, we were in the same <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">At night the men and the women were separated, but during the day they could mingle freely if you were there.</sentence><sentence id="269">We all were in work details.</sentence><sentence id="270">My mother worked in the, what do you call it?Hospital, there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, so the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">So, she physically stayed <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">My dad worked, I think he worked the whole time on the shoe disassembly detail.</sentence><sentence id="273">I was on it for a little while before they shipped me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to work details <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">My brother was working <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> too, I think.</sentence><sentence id="275">But I don't remember where, what details he was assigned to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: And what about, you mentioned having to steal food in order to survive.</sentence><sentence id="288">Was that something that the newer prisoners maybe wouldn't have known how to do or that you kind of eventually learned?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Well (laughs)... no, I think everybody... you didn't steal from each other, generally.</sentence><sentence id="292">Even though it was a matter of survival.</sentence><sentence id="293">I mentioned the Libyans who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">They came with humongous quantities of food.</sentence><sentence id="295">And we had the opportunity to steal some of it.</sentence><sentence id="296">And we actually buried it between the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> so we could bring it back slowly.</sentence><sentence id="297">The other thing is being on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> you were, not always, but sometimes you were patted down, and so you couldn't have anything on your body that didn't belong to you.</sentence><sentence id="298">They must have had a bad storm some years prior to establishing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> was inside a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military training camp</span>, similar to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">A lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> had been, had fallen over in this storm or storms.</sentence><sentence id="301">And they had cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and hauled them off, but there were the roots, you know, standing up.</sentence><sentence id="302">And for a number of months I worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> digging up those tree stumps, which were then, were hauled into... once a week they came out with the horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and we had to load those tree stumps that we had dug up on it and they were hauled in.</sentence><sentence id="303">There was another detail inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was chopping them up into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">firewood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">That's the one I was assigned to the day of that air attack.</sentence><sentence id="305">There were blueberries growing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and one, of course we ate as much as we could, but also we all had, like a bag that was tied to your belt inside your pants.</sentence><sentence id="306">So you could pick berries and bring them in for the family to eat.</sentence><sentence id="307">So there was that and then, of course, if we could we stole the food from the guards. [</sentence><sentence id="308">Laughing.]</sentence><sentence id="309">Boy, they'd take a whipping.</sentence><sentence id="310">They 6</sentence><sentence id="312">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 7 would get their food and most of the time if they didn't finish it, it just sat there.</sentence><sentence id="313">And if somebody, we got a chance, we would try and get those cans and eat it.</sentence><sentence id="314">But apparently one day we ate them before they had eaten and so we got a pretty good whipping for that.</sentence><sentence id="315">It was probably worth it.</sentence><sentence id="316">It was good food.</sentence><sentence id="317">They didn't eat too bad.</sentence><sentence id="318">They got pretty decent food.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Was there a real uniformity of cruelty among the guards or were any of them kind at all to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: There was one sergeant, who the rumor had it later on that he was a spy for the British, he seemed to be more of a... I wouldn't want to call him humane, but had a better sense of humor.</sentence><sentence id="351">And some individual guards were exceedingly cruel and would use any excuse to either kick you or club you with a rifle or shoot you, shoot at you.</sentence><sentence id="352">There was one incident that I recall where one of the guards was giving one of the men, this was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, gave him <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">And he responded in Dutch, "Man, you're crazy."</sentence><sentence id="354">And it turned out to be a Dutchman, the SS guy was a Dutchman, and boy did he beat the living daylights out of him, out of the prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="355">And then when we came back that evening, the sergeant was there and he, we all had to stand at attention.</sentence><sentence id="356">And he demanded to know if anything had happened and this turkey said, "Yes sergeant, this man said I'm crazy."</sentence><sentence id="357">The sergeant said, "That man was right, detail dismissed."</sentence><sentence id="358">We got sent on.</sentence><sentence id="359">But it varied.</sentence><sentence id="360">Some of them would turn their back and just did their job.</sentence><sentence id="361">But they constantly changed.</sentence><sentence id="362">You never knew.</sentence><sentence id="363">You never spoke to any of them.</sentence><sentence id="364">Some of them would drop a cigarette butt and walk away.</sentence><sentence id="365">Others would drop the cigarette butt and wait for you to, try to pick it up and then step on your fingers.</sentence><sentence id="366">You never knew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="384">Q: What about friendships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen</span>?</sentence><sentence id="385">Did you, was it still pretty much each one for his own?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: Yeah, you didn't have time for friendships.</sentence><sentence id="389">You tried to sleep as long as you could in the mornings.</sentence><sentence id="390">You had a few minutes to wash your face and get dressed and stand at reveille, that's not the right word.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="394">Q: Roll call?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="396">A: Roll call, thank you.</sentence><sentence id="397">Until they got done, depends on how they felt whether they got done or not.</sentence><sentence id="398">And then you went to wherever your work assignment was and then when you came back at night, there could have been another roll call before or after and you may have got something to eat and you went straight to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="399">There was never any time to talk to anybody, unless somebody you worked with, the guard had a back turned you could talk to each other.</sentence><sentence id="400">But most of the time you couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="401">They wouldn't let you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="408">Q: So was it seven days a week, every day the same?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: Oh yes, pretty much so.</sentence><sentence id="411">Except they got better food on Sundays.</sentence><sentence id="412">They got three cans instead of two.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="416">Q: Did you have any sense of time or way to keep track of time?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2464">A: Oh yes, yes, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="2465">As you know there are a lot of programs, bits and pieces.</sentence><sentence id="2466">There is a lot... new things, but also things that are being, I think, being hidden from view that never show again.</sentence><sentence id="2467">The... well of course, in addition to Spielberg's movie, I'm not sure what the show was the other day, but there are a number of programs that deal with the Holocaust or deal with certain aspects of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2468">Or for that matter, not necessarily in that context, but primarily in the context of Nazis or Hitlerism and their henchmen and how they got involved and what they did.</sentence><sentence id="2469">And the Holocaust in the broadest sense, in terms of the enslaving of particularly the Slavs, the eastern Europeans and the murder, genocide of them, not necessarily just the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2470">But then one thing, and I have a video of it, it was on PBS maybe twenty-five years ago, about 31</sentence><sentence id="2472">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.05*0012 32 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span>, and I have never seen it again.</sentence><sentence id="2473">I mentioned to you earlier the anti-Semitism of the State Department.</sentence><sentence id="2474">In 1943, when the Holocaust became pretty well-known in government circles, but was being hidden from the American population, a number of Henry Morgenthau's employees went to him and said, "You go to FDR and tell him he does something or else we're going to go public that the U.S. government knows about this and isn't doing anything."</sentence><sentence id="2475">And as a consequence of that, they brought some six, 800, what was then called DPs, displaced persons, to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2476">They had to sign a statement, which of course anybody in his right mind would have, that after the war they would go back to their country of origin.</sentence><sentence id="2477">And they put them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2478">And after the war was over with, they tried to ship them back.</sentence><sentence id="2479">Well, you know, you signed this thing.</sentence><sentence id="2480">But a number of couples had had children here.</sentence><sentence id="2481">They were born at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span> and therefore they were native-born citizens, and therefore their parents were entitled to stay here as the parents of minor American citizens.</sentence><sentence id="2482">The State Department declared <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ticonderoga</span> was not <span class="REGION">American soil</span> and therefore they were not American citizens.</sentence><sentence id="2483">Can you imagine a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that is so historically important in the American Revolution being declared not being a part of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2484">I mean that's the kind of convoluting, convolutions, unfortunately, our government went through.</sentence><sentence id="2485">As I said, that was a PBS show, 25 years ago, I have never seen it again.</sentence><sentence id="2486">I guess too many toes were being stepped on.</sentence><sentence id="2487">But... and of course, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span>, but I couldn't take it, make it past the Saint Louis, because I remember that one vividly.</sentence><sentence id="2488">Another black mark in our history.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2516">Q: So, it was too painful to be going through and reminded?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2518">A: Yeah, I mean the thing is, painful and the thing is that the Saint Louis had roughly nine hundred passengers and I don't think two dozen survived.</sentence><sentence id="2519">It's incredible that the things that the U.S.government could have done, should have done and never did do.</sentence><sentence id="2520">It's that kind of malfeasance that really upset me, particularly in that context.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2525">Q: Related to that, I'm interested in something you said in your last interview, which was a piece of advice that you were giving to other Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2526">That many have met with very good fortune in their post-war lives and that they ought to do what they can to give something back to the community.</sentence><sentence id="2527">And so on the one hand you have that compulsion or that desire and on the other hand, you have this knowledge of the shortcomings of this government and the ways that they have, have really not served the... and in particular in the couple of instances you just brought up, Holocaust survivors.</sentence><sentence id="2528">How do you reconcile those two?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2533">A: Well, those are, in my opinion, two totally separate issues.</sentence><sentence id="2534">Maybe they are related, and that is by giving back to the community, by helping people that are in need of help.</sentence><sentence id="2535">Maybe because the government should and isn't, that you're overcoming the shortcomings of our government.</sentence><sentence id="2536">Even though I don't take that into consideration.</sentence><sentence id="2537">There are two ways that one can give back, one is financially and that's the easy way out that most of us take, is to make contributions to a variety of charitable organizations, or non-profit organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2538">But then the more important one is to give of your time and help people.</sentence><sentence id="2539">I'm sure the same thing holds true for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> there is a shortage, an incredible shortage of volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="2540">And all of us retirees who have spare time, and we should have spare time, should donate some of that time to some of these organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2541">Whether it's Dare to Care to sort out cans of food, or work at the Wayside Christian Mission as an example, any of these <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>, and dish out food for people in need.</sentence><sentence id="2542">Or 32</sentence><sentence id="2544"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0012 33 I work in the tax program, in fact I have somebody come in who needs help with their taxes.</sentence><sentence id="2545">One of the great organizations in general of a variety of needs is <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Charities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2546">And they're desperate for volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="2547">Obviously: they asked me to help.
