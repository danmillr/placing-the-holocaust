<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: I'd like you to just begin by introducing yourself, and -- and telling us where and when you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My name is Max Heller.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, in 1919.</sentence><sentence id="5">I come from a relatively small family, just a sister, and of course my parents.</sentence><sentence id="6">I grew up in a very <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">My parents observed the Shabbas, they would not work on the Sabbath; in fact, they would not even light -- put the light on.</sentence><sentence id="8">In fact, what -- that sort of gives me wonderful memories.</sentence><sentence id="9">My father was more Orthodox than -- than my mother.</sentence><sentence id="10">My father had the philosophy that God takes care of everything, and my mother said God takes care of those who take care of themselves.</sentence><sentence id="11">So I'm sort of an in-between.</sentence><sentence id="12">If I lean to anything I lean to, you must take care of yourself rather than -- and my father would run across the <span class="DLF">street</span> against the light because he knew God would take care of him.</sentence><sentence id="13">But it's interesting, that kind of faith helped us when things got very bad.</sentence><sentence id="14">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a very happy <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">We were not wealthy by any means, I would say we were middle income people, both my mother and my father worked.</sentence><sentence id="16">They had their own business, which was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span>, but they sold to individuals on a credit basis, and they had several salesmen that went out and sold the merchandise and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="17">I -- as I told you, I was brought up Orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="18">In fact, I had a Hebrew teacher from the time I was eight years old to prepare me for -- for my Bar Mitzvah, he came to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> three times a week.</sentence><sentence id="19">I remember that teacher, because he taught me a lot, not just the Hebrew part, but also, after the lesson he would sit with me and talk to me about what Judaism is all about, the ethics, the morals, and the stories, and I was fascinated with that.</sentence><sentence id="20">And I would say that today I'm a strong</sentence><sentence id="22">Jew, more on the side of the morals and the ethics, and how you're supposed to behave, than the rituals.</sentence><sentence id="23">I -- I have nothing against rituals, I -- I observe but not -- not as much as I -- I try to live like this man taught me, so I'm -- I'm trying to give you a picture of what life was like in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">My sister was two years old than I am.</sentence><sentence id="25">She -- she probably did not experience things the way I did because as a youngster I was involved in a lot of fights because I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="26">I experienced a lot more anti-Semitism than my sister did.</sentence><sentence id="27">So it -- in that respect, perhaps we grew up a little bit different.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: Why would you have experienced more than your sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: Well, my sister, if there was any -- any anti-Semitic action on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, she certainly would run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> rather than get out and fight.</sentence><sentence id="58">So -- so it was a -- really different, she was not exposed as much as -- as I was.</sentence><sentence id="59">And I -- I -- you know, I-I sort of lived through it.</sentence><sentence id="60">I belonged to -- when I got older I belonged to a sport club called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ha-Koah</span>, the word stands for strength, and I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">wrestling section</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">So all of these guys -- I was like a mascot.</sentence><sentence id="62">In those days they were really national champs.</sentence><sentence id="63">They didn't shy away from defending yourself.</sentence><sentence id="64">And it's interesting when I think about it now, is what made my Judaism stronger then, and still is today is you cannot shy away.</sentence><sentence id="65">You must face, you must face anti-Semitism, if it exists.</sentence><sentence id="66">You -- you cannot just walk away from it.</sentence><sentence id="67">And even today when I see something that I feel -- and I've been in company of people that say things like, oh, I Jewed him down, as an example.</sentence><sentence id="68">I speak up.</sentence><sentence id="69">And perhaps this goes back to my childhood when I was -- I spoke up, and I defended myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: But what at that point gave you the strength to defend yoursel -- yourself, instead of to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: Well, I -- th-that's a very good question.</sentence><sentence id="85">You know, people say I'm proud to be a Jew, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="88">That's -- but you have to know why you are proud, and | think because of my upbringing, both my mother and father, and then this teacher that I'm talking about, I felt good being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="91">never -- I never had to shy away, it was something that I was very proud of, but I knew why.</sentence><sentence id="92">And so this, I think, made the difference, it's the upbringing that makes the difference.</sentence><sentence id="93">I was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="94">Even today I have people that -- I live in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the south, and we have a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Bob Jones University</span>, and they always send people out trying to convert you.</sentence><sentence id="95">They knock on my <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">And both Trude, my wife and I, when we answer the <span class="DLF">door</span>, we say, you have the wrong address.</sentence><sentence id="97">We are very happy with what we are.</sentence><sentence id="98">Maybe you're happy with what you are.</sentence><sentence id="99">And so this -- you know, it carries forward, there's no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="100">And we -- I think our children feel the same way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Let's go back.</sentence><sentence id="117">You were talking about the fact that your family was very observant.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="120">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Do you have fond memories of some of those observances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="124">A: Probably the happiest time of my life, this may sound ridiculous, when we were the poorest.</sentence><sentence id="125">And this was during the depression, I -- in Europe the depression started perhaps a little earlier than it did in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">But my parents had practically lost their <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">And they refused to go into <span class="BUILDING">bankruptcy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">And so we had to give up our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and we moved into one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">My sister, myself, my mother and father, and occasionally my mother's sister.</sentence><sentence id="130">And on the Sabbath, in this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, when during the day we would not light -- there was no light, the most beautiful time was when later in the afternoon -- we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the morning, but later in the afternoon we would crawl in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with Mother and Father, and my father would tell these stories about he served four years in the war -- in -- on the side of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, incidentally.</sentence><sentence id="131">But my mother would sing the most beautiful Jewish songs, and most of them are very sad, but they were beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="132">And we -- my -- we used to si -- we were lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> crying, not because we were unhappy, because we were happy.</sentence><sentence id="133">And I've learned a lot from that.</sentence><sentence id="134">I -- I've learned to become</sentence><sentence id="136">really sentimental about my -- my Yiddish [indecipherable] and to appreciate li -- really life, because the songs deal with life.</sentence><sentence id="137">So I would say i-if you say what gave it to me, and what -- what my life was like, this I think determined the way I am.</sentence><sentence id="138">Those times.</sentence><sentence id="139">I remember at the end of the day on the Sabbath, they turned the lights on, and they would sit down at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and they would divide the money they had earned -- they went to work for other people, and they divided the money that they had to pay the creditors.</sentence><sentence id="140">And when things got better, my mother and father were able to get back into business.</sentence><sentence id="141">My father was very proud of the name, he wouldn't think of bankruptcy.</sentence><sentence id="142">And again, that I think taught me a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="143">So these were -- these were happy times, although they were tough times.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Tell me about the Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in general.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, Jewish people were about 10 percent of the population.</sentence><sentence id="169">And it was a very rich life.</sentence><sentence id="170">The Jews were involved in -- in the music, they were involved in -- in politics, they were involved certainly in the arts and sciences, and in teaching.</sentence><sentence id="171">And Jews, generally speaking, I would say, were quite influential.</sentence><sentence id="172">They were also -- not all of them were successful, but they were mostly successful people, and -- and very law abiding.</sentence><sentence id="173">We didn't -- we had nobody to be ashamed of.</sentence><sentence id="174">So Jewish life was a rich life, I would say, although I must tell you, sa -- when -- I go back now to -- to this sa -- during the day on Saturday, the thing that really touched me is my mother would tell us stories about her life as a teenager in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">She grew up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubachow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">Her parents, I would say, were poor people.</sentence><sentence id="177">Very, very observant.</sentence><sentence id="178">I still remember my grandfather, very much so because he was a very imposing man with a white beard, and -- but he always would tell me these stories, and my mother would tell us what happened to her as a child.</sentence><sentence id="179">She was sent away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when she was not even 10 years old because the fear that they had of pogroms, when soldiers would come and rape girls.</sentence><sentence id="180">They -- she and her sisters would</sentence><sentence id="182">hide under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">And so one day they were sent to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to a -- to a member of the family, and my mother, at age 10 or so, had to work for that family, although she lived with them.</sentence><sentence id="184">She was like a -- she took care of the baby, she helped clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">So when you hear from your own mother what -- what she went through -- but my mother was never bitter.</sentence><sentence id="186">The -- the thing that my mother always said, but look, here we are.</sentence><sentence id="187">And thank God we are alive.</sentence><sentence id="188">I -- I survived that.</sentence><sentence id="189">So these are -- these are all part of my -- my make-up, and it was very meaningful to me to hear what my parents went through.</sentence><sentence id="190">My father went -- was in the service for four years as I told you, he was wounded in the war.</sentence><sentence id="191">And yet, when Hitler came, it made absolutely no -- no difference.</sentence><sentence id="192">Neither my mother nor my father went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> because the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> would not have them.</sentence><sentence id="193">And both my parents were self educated, and went in <span class="BUILDING">business</span> self educated.</sentence><sentence id="194">So as a result of that, education was the most important thing in our family.</sentence><sentence id="195">So it -- it all comes back.</sentence><sentence id="196">You know, people say, well, the Jewish people are so intent on education.</sentence><sentence id="197">This is a good reason.</sentence><sentence id="198">That's why.</sentence><sentence id="199">And my mother would even write in her -- she -- she sometimes would keep a journal, which we found only recently, and it was very touching what she said.</sentence><sentence id="200">She says, one day I had -- I prayed that my children would have a good education.</sentence><sentence id="201">It's the most important thing in the world.</sentence><sentence id="202">So -- so perhaps this gives you a -- a picture of what -- what it was like, life for me in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and generally life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">But we had good times in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, too, we used to -- we used to go to balls, and -- during Mardi Gras season.</sentence><sentence id="204">In fact, every summer we would have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and that's where I met my -- my wife, when I was -- I was 17 and she was 14.</sentence><sentence id="205">And the day I met her I told her I was going to marry her, and her father overheard it, and I was not his favorite person after that.</sentence><sentence id="206">She was -- she was the only child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: You spoke of education.</sentence><sentence id="249">I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, and whether you went to <span class="BUILDING">integrated schools</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: -- or whether you went only to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish institutions</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="260">No, I went -- when my -- my <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> was boys only, and that's not unusual, it was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">I went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> for four years, it was totally integrated.</sentence><sentence id="262">We had -- in fact I had many non-Jewish friends when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">And then after -- at age 10 is when I finished <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>, and stood an exam to enter into a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> called <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">And that too was integrated.</sentence><sentence id="265">We had religion -- we took religion in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in contrast to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and this is -- that's one reason why I feel so strong about not mixing religion with the state, because we -- when we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, we had religion, but we had to leave our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and we went to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish class</span>, so to speak, when others went to the <span class="BUILDING">Christian class</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">That was not very good, but -- but the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was integrated.</sentence><sentence id="267">I experienced anti-Semitism then, where you know, you'd find scribbled notes, you Jew, or Jew go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="268">Some of the professors we had, I felt were anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="269">Maybe it's because I didn't study that much, but some of them, on the other hand, I felt were very sympathetic.</sentence><sentence id="270">So my schooling -- I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> not because I was genius, but the system was that you can finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> after four years, and I went to work as an apprentice.</sentence><sentence id="271">And I made the equivalent of maybe 20 dollars a month.</sentence><sentence id="272">And while I, however, while I was working I went to a <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> for three years.</sentence><sentence id="273">And while I was not a very good student in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> was really what I wanted, and I -- I -- I did quite well.</sentence><sentence id="274">So I worked and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: And what was the work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: I -- the sc -- the business that I worked for, they had five and 10 cent <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> which they started, and in fact they were among the first.</sentence><sentence id="294">And they also would sell merchandise on</sentence><sentence id="296">consignment and put people in business.</sentence><sentence id="297">And my work when I first started was sweeping <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and cleaning <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and that sort of thing, but within -- when I was 17, I was in charge of a department and I had learned about import/export, because a lot of the merchandise which we sold was imported.</sentence><sentence id="298">And I had taken all kinds of courses which enabled me to become a buyer for -- for that <span class="BUILDING">company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">And a good many of the people that worked -- the company was owned by a Jewish man, and the people that worked there were both Jews and non-Jews.</sentence><sentence id="300">And I must tell you this, we haven't come to Hitler yet, but Hitler came in on a -- on a Friday, on, I believe it was March the 11".</sentence><sentence id="301">On Monday I went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, we didn't know what to do, so you go, like you always go, I went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">And the same people that I had worked with for several years already -- this was 1937 -- is when -- deg38, excuse me, when Hitler came.</sentence><sentence id="303">The same people that I had worked with for several years suddenly appeared in Nazi uniforms with the swastika band.</sentence><sentence id="304">The same people that I had lunch with every day, that I -- that I went out with, the very same people.</sentence><sentence id="305">And that was a shock.</sentence><sentence id="306">And this -- this just tells you really, what went on, and how -- how life was.</sentence><sentence id="307">In a way we kidded ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="308">We -- we kidded.</sentence><sentence id="309">Although we had all of these fights and troubles, but never thought that it would get to a point as it did.</sentence><sentence id="310">What also happened is a man who worked for the owner of our company, that our owner had put in business, came in one day and took over the business.</sentence><sentence id="311">Came in with a group of Nazis in black and brown uniforms and just took the business.</sentence><sentence id="312">And ironically made out a receipt, and fired everybody, except three of us.</sentence><sentence id="313">And we were put into one <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and we -- and the reason they didn't fire us is the people they put in charge had to learn something.</sentence><sentence id="314">So I'm -- I'm trying to really give you a picture of -- it's -- it's -- it's -- when I think about it, "m really amazed myself of how we were so foolish prior to Hitler not to recognize, or not to sense that there was more to this than just having a fight in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: Let's just backtrack, cause of course I -- I want you to tell me much more about when Hitler came in.</sentence><sentence id="346">You mentioned that there were fights in the s -- in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, or scribbled notes.</sentence><sentence id="347">Can you talk a little bit more about other hints, or -- or outright incidents of anti-Semitism prior to Hitler?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: Well, of course the Nazi party had started many, many years ago.</sentence><sentence id="352">And in fact, they killed a chancellor, his name was Dollfuss, several years before Hitler came into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">But it was after 1933, where Hitler came into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, where he took over the German government.</sentence><sentence id="354">And those people, his followers, killed Dollfuss, and they were put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">So there was always that unrest, and there was always -- <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> had maybe 10 - 15 political parties, and there were marches in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">It's -- it's quite different than it is here.</sentence><sentence id="357">And it always resulted in -- in fights and even killings.</sentence><sentence id="358">There was -- the anti-Semitism that you could feel in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was that sometimes you could not live where you wanted to live.</sentence><sentence id="359">You were rejected on a job because you were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="360">So it -- it wa -- it wa -- those kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="361">But we lived with it, and this was -- you almost get used to a way of life, that's just the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="362">And so you -- you live with it.</sentence><sentence id="363">When people came -- we had somebody in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I worked who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span> and he told us stories about that Jewish businesses were taken over, and Jews were beaten and all that.</sentence><sentence id="364">I must tell you the truth, we didn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="365">We thought oh, there must be something wrong with that man.</sentence><sentence id="366">Why would they do anything like that?</sentence><sentence id="367">So there was a difference between political national socialism and the anti-Semitic part of anti -- o-of that fascism.</sentence><sentence id="368">It was either political, but it was also anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="369">So it was in that atmosphere that we grew up.</sentence><sentence id="370">Maybe I felt it more than others because I was in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish club</span>, and maybe because of the section where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="371">Maybe I was more aware of it because of the education that I had.</sentence><sentence id="372">And my mother, the stories that she would tell me, I -- I was sort of on the -- I -- I had like an antenna.</sentence><sentence id="373">You -- you get sensitive where you -- where you feel these things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: Were you beaten up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: I was beaten up and I beat up.</sentence><sentence id="406">I did it both ways.</sentence><sentence id="407">Oh definitely.</sentence><sentence id="408">I -- 1 came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> sometimes with a bloody nose.</sentence><sentence id="409">But I also came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where I felt very triumphant, where I gave somebody a bloody nose.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="415">Q: But none of this taunting -- was that disturbing to you, or that surprising to you?</sentence><sentence id="416">Didn't you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- and talk to your family and say why is this happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: No, not really, because I knew the history of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="420">Not only my mother's experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but I knew about the Spanish Inquisition.</sentence><sentence id="421">I knew what happened in Europe, in many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where Jews lived, and then came another king or another prince or another chancellor, and Jews had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="422">I knew all that.</sentence><sentence id="423">I had -- I had heard stories from my grandfather in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, who told me what -- what he had experienced.</sentence><sentence id="424">So this -- you know, this was the history of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="425">I accepted that.</sentence><sentence id="426">That was the way life was, and -- and the more -- the more they -- the more they were after us, the stronger we became, I felt, at least.</sentence><sentence id="427">It's like when you -- when you hunt an animal, the fox becomes very fast and clever, because it hunted in -- in a way, that's the way it was, certainly with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="437">Q: Now you went to <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> or <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span>, but they were mixed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="443">A: Most of my friends were Jewish, but some of them, of course, were not.</sentence><sentence id="444">And one of the bad experiences I had after Hitler came was with a friend, a non-Jewish friend that I had known for many, many years, who in fact belonged to the same club, the sport club that I belonged to.</sentence><sentence id="445">And he is the one that threw me on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and made me scrub the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="446">And when I wanted to pull my pants up not to make -- make them wet, he -- he pulled them down, and he called me a</sentence><sentence id="448">0 [indecipherable] a pig Jew.</sentence><sentence id="449">That was perhaps the greatest shock.</sentence><sentence id="450">Can you imagine that you -- you sort of grew up with somebody and suddenly this is what happens to you.</sentence><sentence id="451">You really feel, when something like that happens, you feel it perhaps more because of the disappointment, because it's something I did not expect.</sentence><sentence id="452">Fighting on the <span class="DLF">street</span> I -- 1 expected.</sentence><sentence id="453">You know, that -- it really didn't bother me.</sentence><sentence id="454">But this was a betrayal, I was betrayed.</sentence><sentence id="455">So when you ask me about friends, I'm not saying that every one was like that.</sentence><sentence id="456">Most of my non-Jewish friends would not have anything to do with me after that.</sentence><sentence id="457">That -- and this, in a way, I -- I expected that.</sentence><sentence id="458">I -- I -- I just -- they were protecting themselves, and at that point I was much more interested with what was going to happen to us, could we get out, than if somebody spoke to me or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="477">Q: But it must have been tremendously hurtful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="479">A: Oh, it was very hurtful, it was very hurtful.</sentence><sentence id="480">One time I was surrounded by a group of people -- when I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was telling you about, th-the <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> while I was working, and one time I was surrounded by maybe 10 or 15 people my age that I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, who threatened to beat me up.</sentence><sentence id="481">And if it hadn't been for a police officer -- and that was unusual by the way, that a police officer would interfere, because normally they looked aside, I would have been beaten to a pulp, I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="482">It was hurtful.</sentence><sentence id="483">Th-There's no question about it.</sentence><sentence id="484">But you know, it just didn't get me down.</sentence><sentence id="485">This is where my father's faith comes in.</sentence><sentence id="486">I knew that some -- we -- we had to get out, there was no question about that, and we did not go to pieces.</sentence><sentence id="487">It's interesting, with all the troubles, Jewish people would still tell jokes.</sentence><sentence id="488">When -- when all these -- these bad things happened, they would still tell jokes.</sentence><sentence id="489">They would still talk about normal life.</sentence><sentence id="490">You don't just give up everything.</sentence><sentence id="491">That's the way life was, you -- you went on, you tried to do -- live as normal as you could, which really wasn't normal.</sentence><sentence id="492">Because I remember my mother and father had -- or everything they had, their bank account was confiscated after Hitler, and we lived</sentence><sentence id="494">1 from what my mother had saved -- and I often tell Trude I hope you have some money somewhere I don't know about.</sentence><sentence id="495">And after awhile when that ran out, we began to sell, like my mother liked silver and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="496">And this is what we lived from.</sentence><sentence id="497">My mother made -- I -- every day we ate like potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="498">Meat was hardly ever, but never complained.</sentence><sentence id="499">We never -- we never complained about it.</sentence><sentence id="500">So I -- I don't know how others reacted.</sentence><sentence id="501">We were glad that we -- we were still alive, we were hopeful that we would get out, and of course we -- we -- we did get out.</sentence><sentence id="502">I -- I -- I don't want to talk about the beatings that people took, and what we saw on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="503">It is indescribable in a way.</sentence><sentence id="504">It's -- it's unbelievable that this happened to people that confessed to be God fearing -- I mean that people who -- who said they believe in God, went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, went to concert, loved music, loved literature, that these are the very same people that turned into -- to beasts, and then came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and loved and hugged their children.</sentence><sentence id="505">So it was a tough time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="539">Q: Because you -- you've mentioned that you knew a little bit of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but you didn't either believe it or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="540">A: We -- we did not -- we knew a little bit, we did not know everything, of course.</sentence><sentence id="541">And also you have to remember during those years there were not -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> had not started yet.</sentence><sentence id="542"><span class="BUILDING">Businesses</span> were confiscated, laws were passed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that for instance a Jewish doctor could -- did not cre -- treat a non-Jewish patient and the other way around.</sentence><sentence id="543">That Jews could not employ non-Jews, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="544">Those -- those were the laws that were passed, but there were no -- no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="545">There was always a rumbling going on, and Hitler proposed that <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> be annexed to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="546">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was to be taken, I believe it was on the 13" of March, 1938.</sentence><sentence id="547">The chancellor, the Austrian chancellor at that time, his name was Schuschnigg</sentence></p></dialogue>

jubilant.</sentence><sentence id="567">They were not victims, the Austrians were not victims.</sentence><sentence id="568">They were part of it.</sentence><sentence id="569">And I -- I remember this was on a Friday and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> immediately, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I said, what are we going to do?</sentence><sentence id="570">And my mother said, "It's Shabbas, it's Friday night.</sentence><sentence id="571">We're gonna have a -- we gonna have Sabbath."</sentence><sentence id="572">And believe it or not, we sat down at the <span

was really like a festival.</sentence><sentence id="574">My mother said this is Shabbas, we're going to sit down, we're going to have our meal.</sentence><sentence id="575">She lit the candles, she prayed over the candles, we had our meal, my father said the prayers.</sentence><sentence id="576">And then, after that is when we really began to talk.</sentence><sentence id="577">But this -- that -- the -- the ritual of the Friday night service remained, in fact it probably was the most meaningful Friday night we ever spent.</sentence><sentence id="578">There was great strength there, and great faith.</sentence><sentence id="579">Well, now I| must tell you what happened.</sentence><sentence id="580">I'll go back a little.</sentence><sentence id="581">In 1937, on -- this is when we went to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the summer and rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="582">I met my wife, I told you about that.</sentence><sentence id="583">I immediately fell in love with her.</sentence><sentence id="584">But the week when I met her, for some unexplainable reason --</sentence><sentence id="586">3 my father would commute and he would come in on a Friday and stay til Monday.</sentence><sentence id="587">On Thursday, I cannot tell you why, I'll never know why, I decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and come back on Friday with my father.</sentence><sentence id="588">And everybody said, why you going, you just met Trude, and I said, I just feel like going.</sentence><sentence id="589">And when I got off the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, I met a boy friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="590">And he said, what are you doing this evening?</sentence><sentence id="591">And I said, I really have no plans, I don't even know why I came.</sentence><sentence id="592">He said, why don't go we -- why don't we go dancing.</sentence><sentence id="593">And so I met him that evening and we went to an <span class="BUILDING">outdoor restaurant</span> where there were -- where there was dancing.</sentence><sentence id="594">And I -- in -- in Europe it is quite appropriate that you can get up from your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, walk over to -- to a lady and ask her to dance, and if she says no, you -- you know, you're a little embarrassed, but you go back to your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="595">So I had noticed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a -- it was obvious that they were Americans.</sentence><sentence id="596">There were five girls and a chaperone.</sentence><sentence id="597">And I said to my friend, I says, you know this -- this -- there's one girl there, I really like her looks and I'm going to ask her to dance with me.</sentence><sentence id="598">If she says no, I'm going to walk out, cause I'm not going to come back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and be embarrassed.</sentence><sentence id="599">So I paid my bill and I walked over, and in German -- I couldn't speak English, I asked the chaperone, may I dance with one of the girls, and they looked me over, and they agreed, and I asked this girl to dance with me.</sentence><sentence id="600">And we danced until the <span class="NPIP">place</span> closed, about one o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="601">And then I asked the chaperone, may I come the next day on Friday and take this young lady for a walk and show her Vienna, and they -- after a conference they agreed.</sentence><sentence id="602">And so the next day I -- I bought a little dictionary, and I picked her up at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we made -- we walked for about two hours, made conversation through this dictionary.</sentence><sentence id="603">I took her back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and she by the way was -- she had just graduated <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, so she was just about my age.</sentence><sentence id="604">I said, give me your name and address, and I will learn how to speak English and then I will write to you.</sentence><sentence id="605">So she gave me her name and address, and her name was Mary Mills, she lived on <span class="DLF">Mills Avenue</span>,</sentence><sentence id="607">4 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span>, <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span>, U.S.A.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="875">A: Austrians more than Germans.</sentence><sentence id="876">It's very interesting that -- that you ask me that question, because I had some narrow escapes where I was saved by a German.</sentence><sentence id="877">I remember one time, Trude's father had loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, and he had a brand new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="878">And one day I came to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she said, "They came and got my father's <span

this?"</sentence><sentence id="881">And like a fool I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span>, and there hundreds of people were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> because they had been called to come to the Gestapo, and I, like a schmoe stand there, and suddenly a -- a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">staff car</span>, a German officer gets out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and he takes a look at me and says, "Why are you here?"</sentence><sentence id="882">And I tell him</sentence><sentence id="884">8 the story, he says, "Take my advice.</sentence><sentence id="885">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="886">So this is -- this is one time when -- when a German really -- a German officer helped me.</sentence><sentence id="887">I had another experience -- you know, you gotta have some luck in life.</sentence><sentence id="888">People call it miracle, luck, whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="889">In order to cu -- to get the visa from the Americans, we had to have a paper from the Austrian government saying that we had no -- committed no crime, and that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="890">My sister applied for it and I did, and hers came back and mine didn't.</sentence><sentence id="891">And in the meantime I received a letter from the <span

says, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do for you.</sentence><sentence id="898">It'll take days and days and days to -- to search your record.</sentence><sentence id="899">And while I'm talking to him, a young girl walks up, and calls him aside, and they -- two of them look at me, and they whisper, and he comes back to me and he says, if I have your word that you will not tell this to anybody,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1007">Q: Well, they actually, y-y-you remember the story about Kristallnacht, and I think that was in November of 1938, what the government actually said, on this and this day, you can go out and do what you want.</sentence><sentence id="1008">You go ahead, break -- break the -- the <span class="DLF">store windows</span>, go ahead and beat up people.</sentence><sentence id="1009">Go, do what you want, you've got 24 hours to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1010">So it was the government that controlled the chaos, you're right.</sentence><sentence id="1011">But individuals, that doesn't -- didn't mean that individuals did not perform violence.</sentence><sentence id="1012">But the government controlled -- which was even worse than if it were just a riot on the part of people, cause by that time they already began to build <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and they had passed all these different laws.</sentence><sentence id="1013">The Nuremberg Laws became the Austrian laws.</sentence><sentence id="1014">So that -- it was a -- it was a very well organized effort.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1015">Q: I guess my question here is, how long did it take after March 13" for things to settle down a little bit, and for the government, German or Austrian, to really take charge in a -- in a systematic way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1017">A: Well, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in July, the end of July 1938.</sentence><sentence id="1018">By that time it was not systematic, it was still -- some of it was systematic yes, if you wanted to take over a business, if a -- if -- ifa Austrian wanted to take your business, and they would have a friend who is a Nazi, they were so well organized that they gave you a receipt.</sentence><sentence id="1019">Now, I'm not being facetious.</sentence><sentence id="1020">So when I left there was still that -- that sort of thing going on.</sentence><sentence id="1021">In fact, I would say, after that is when it became more regulated.</sentence><sentence id="1022">But that didn't mean that you didn't fear of your life.</sentence><sentence id="1023">The difference was that it wa -- the -- the uniform people that came, it was the Gestapo people who came for you, rather than an individual ho-hoodlum, if that's -- if that's what you mean.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1027">Q: Yeah, well, I -- I -- I mean, I can't imagine that this massive violence and looting and beating that s -- that began immediately, went on continuously for months.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1028">A: No, no, n-no, you're right, no.</sentence><sentence id="1029">It -- it was still there, but not -- not in the same force.</sentence><sentence id="1030">At first people were evidently told, do what you want.</sentence><sentence id="1031">And that was an outlet for them, I mean, they were so happy that Hitler came because now they could loot.</sentence><sentence id="1032">Now, if they wanted our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they got it.</sentence><sentence id="1033">Now, if they wanted our <span class="BUILDING">business</span>, they got it.</sentence><sentence id="1034">Right?</sentence><sentence id="1035">So that was at first, and then, of course it became more regulated because the government stepped in and built the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, an-and that sort of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>

80 hours a week and I was very happy to.</sentence><sentence id="1588">I would have done anything.</sentence><sentence id="1589">So, after one week, I lived</sentence><sentence id="1591">2 with this family who was a superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1592">Came the end of the week, I said, "I want to pay you." "</sentence><sentence id="1593">No," he says, "I don't want you to pay me."</sentence><sentence id="1594">I says, "I'm not going to stay free, I -- I have money.</sentence><sentence id="1595">I have nine -- I have nine dollars and 90 cents."</sentence><sentence id="1596">I said, "I want to pay you or else I leave."</sentence><sentence id="1597">He says, "No, you cannot pay me."</sentence><sentence id="1598">So I had found out there was another Jewish family who took in <span class="DLF">borders</span> and they charged seven dollars a week to be a <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1599">So I moved in with them, I paid my seven dollars, and I saved about a dollar, a dollar and a half a week out of the difference.</sentence><sentence id="1600">And then, ultimately, I moved with the family that brought me here.</sentence><sentence id="1601">And they were wonderful to me, absolutely wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1602">And he gave my daughter -- my sister a job, and my sister came over and we both stayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="1603">And -- and I insisted that I pay them.</sentence><sentence id="1604">And I said, I will not -- and I did.</sentence><sentence id="1605">And so she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, I worked in the shipping department, and I'll never forget -- I remember a -- a few months after I came here -- I used to listen to the radio a great deal, this is how I learned -- I went to movies, which were 10 cents, I think, but listened to the radio and I 1 -- I learned by the sound, and -- English and -- and it -- it didn't take me that long.</sentence><sentence id="1606">So one day I learned that there was a bill in the Congress -- I heard that on the radio, to have a minimum wage.</sentence><sentence id="1607">And it was to be 25 cents an hour, for 48 hours, I think, and time and a half over that.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And I says, oh my God, 48 times 25 is 14 dollars, I make 10, and overtime?</sentence><sentence id="1609">I was all for it.</sentence><sentence id="1610">And I'll never forget that, the republican -- I didn't know the difference between democrats or republicans.</sentence><sentence id="1611">The democrats, however, I learned, proposed the minimum wage, and the republicans were -- opposed it.</sentence><sentence id="1612">That's when I became a democrat by the way.</sentence><sentence id="1613">I fig -- I figured I'll make 14 dollars an hour.</sentence><sentence id="1614">And -- and of course the bill -- bill went through, and interestingly enough, after 48 hours, I checked out the time clock, I didn't get time and a half, but they gave me money to have supper with.</sentence><sentence id="1615">And my work, I made progress in my work.</sentence><sentence id="1616">A few months after I was in the shipping department, the foreman in the shipping department left.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And</sentence><sentence id="1619">3 so I went to Mr. Saltzman, I said, "I'd like to have his job."</sentence><sentence id="1620">He says, "How can you have his job, you can't speak English."</sentence><sentence id="1621">I said, "I'll show them what to do."</sentence><sentence id="1622">He said, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="1623">I mean really, this is how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And I became foreman in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1625">Then ultimately my parents came over and he gave my father a job.</sentence><sentence id="1626">And my mother and father moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1627">Ironically, I became my father's boss.</sentence><sentence id="1628">It was tragic.</sentence><sentence id="1629">I mean, he was a man, he was 50 -- he was 50 years old when he came here, and here I was, 19 at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1630">And I told him what to do, and he schlepped the boxes just like I did.</sentence><sentence id="1631">Never complained, never.</sentence><sentence id="1632">It wa -- never a -- not for a moment did we complain.</sentence><sentence id="1633">So we moved into an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and ultimately I was able to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and a -- I made progress in my work.</sentence><sentence id="1634">The internal sales manager left.</sentence><sentence id="1635">I was lucky, they were all leaving, and I -- again I went to -- to the owner of the business, I said, "Give me a chance for this."</sentence><sentence id="1636">He says, "But how you gonna correspond with customers, you have -- I said, don't worry, I'll learn."</sentence><sentence id="1637">So I would stay every night, and I go through the files and I memorized letters.</sentence><sentence id="1638">And I found out after awhile, well, if you have 10 letters, different situations, pretty much that's it.</sentence><sentence id="1639">So I gave numbers to the letters and I had a secretary that would type them, and I'd say number two, number three.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And this is -- and I was very fortunate with -- given an opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="1641">I also learned that if you want something, you have to ask for it.</sentence><sentence id="1642">That man was wonderful to me.</sentence><sentence id="1643">The day I met him, I said, "I'll never leave you unless I can go in business for myself.</sentence><sentence id="1644">That's the only time when -- when I will leave you."</sentence><sentence id="1645">Well, Trude in the meantime -- you remember Trude, came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1646">She had a much harder time than I did getting out.</sentence><sentence id="1647">She escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and had terrible experiences.</sentence><sentence id="1648">And in 1942, we were -- we were married.</sentence><sentence id="1649">She came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1940, and we married in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1650">And her mother and father came to -- came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenville</span> with her, and her uncle did.</sentence><sentence id="1651">This same man, this Mr. Saltzman who had given a job to my father, to my sister, now he gave a job to her father and her uncle.</sentence><sentence id="1652">He was a -- this man was -- was an angel.</sentence><sentence id="1653">He rests in</sentence><sentence id="1655">4 peace, I can tell you that.</sentence><sentence id="1656">Then, after -- I made my -- and Trude, my wife, she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1657">She -- she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1791">Q: Can I just ask what -- when did your parents finally get out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1793">A: In November of 1938, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1794">So the whole family, we were all working at the <span class="BUILDING">shirt

id="1796">He was very good to me, he -- he said, "I'll let you buy one percent of the business, and the way you pay for it is from the profit."</sentence><sentence id="1797">And so I owned one percent

<span class="BUILDING">business</span>, I left him.</sentence><sentence id="1800">He was, I would say rightfully so, he was upset, because he had been wonderful to me.</sentence><sentence id="1801">But I always wanted to be in business for myself, and we had saved up about 10,000 dollars, because every time I was promoted, I would get a very nice increase, and my wife worked, and I worked, and we -- we were careful.</sentence><sentence id="1802">W-We never had a credit -- a charge card until we had enough money to know that we can pay.</sentence><sentence id="1803">So anyhow, I went in business with a partner in 1946, and went into the shirt business in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> because I didn't want to be competitive.</sentence><sentence id="1804">And after two years we split.</sentence><sentence id="1805">And he remained with the business, and I had more money than I thought ever existed, because we had done well in those two years.</sentence><sentence id="1806">But as partners we did not get along, and we had a buy or sell agreement.</sentence><sentence id="1807">So after I sold my share of the business, a few days later I went in business for myself, and my only partner was my wife.</sentence><sentence id="1808">I started a <span class="BUILDING">company</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Maxon shirt company</span>, and that was in 1948.</sentence><sentence id="1809">And the company did well, and we, in the meantime we had three children, three wonderful children, two daughters and a son.</sentence><sentence id="1810">We had bought our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1811">It was modest, and -- but we paid for it.</sentence><sentence id="1812">And so I went into business, as I said myself, and that was in 1948.</sentence><sentence id="1813">14 years later I sold that <span class="BUILDING">business</span>, and that was a philosophical decision.</sentence><sentence id="1814">First of all we learned that you don't worship money.</sentence><sentence id="1815">And Trude and I felt the same way about</sentence><sentence id="1817">5 it.</sentence><sentence id="1818">| had met a friend of mine who had very bad business problems.</sentence><sentence id="1819">And he -- I noticed that he was really beside himself, and I -- I said this -- this -- I just won't let this happen.</sentence><sentence id="1820">And so I said, I don't want to be the richest man in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1821">And we had a chance to either go public, or sell the <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1822">And I told Trude, I said Trude, "I -- I want to sell.</sentence><sentence id="1823">How do you feel about it?"</sentence><sentence id="1824">And she says, "If that's what you want.</sentence><sentence id="1825">What are you going to do?"</sentence><sentence id="1826">I said, "Don't worry."</sentence><sentence id="1827">So in 1962, after in business 14 years, I sold the <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1828">And I stayed with the <span class="BUILDING">business</span> for five years, I had a contract.</sentence><sentence id="1829">I was active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> as soon as I could.</sentence><sentence id="1830">My first experience in community work was with a group of Christian women who were interested to do something about first and youthful offenders.</sentence><sentence id="1831">It was my first involvement, and I became deeply interested in that when we were able to get laws changed where youthful offenders were separated from hardened criminals.</sentence><sentence id="1832">And I continued to be quite active in the community, including, of course, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, president of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and every Jewish organization.</sentence><sentence id="1833">And then one day I received a call saying there's a rumor that you are interested to run for mayor.</sentence><sentence id="1834">I thought -- that had never, never occurred to me.</sentence><sentence id="1835">But I had been involved do something about <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for the poor.</sentence><sentence id="1836">I became very interested in that, and I started a <span class="BUILDING">housing foundation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1837">And wherever I turned, I found that the government is involved.</sentence><sentence id="1838">And I said no, I -- I'm not going to run for mayor, but maybe I'll run for city council, and I did.</sentence><sentence id="1839">And so I was elected for -- on a two year term.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And then after two years the -- the term of the mayor was up.</sentence><sentence id="1841">And I -- I ran for mayor and I was elected, about 70 percent of the vote.</sentence><sentence id="1842">Interestingly enough, I ran as a democrat, I had no opposition from the republicans, but I had oppositions from the democrats, and they -- the fellow who ran against me came to me one day, and he says, "You know, God came to me and said that I should run against you."</sentence><sentence id="1843">This is the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1844">And I says, "Well God never said anything to me about you."</sentence><sentence id="1845">Well, make a long story short, I -- I was elected, and I was mayor for a -- two four year terms, eight years.</sentence><sentence id="1846">I also ran</sentence><sentence id="1848">6 for the Congress.</sentence><sentence id="1849">At the end of -- we -- we -- I proposed the term limitations.</sentence><sentence id="1850">I felt like eight years is plenty, and so I could not run again and this -- the congressional seat was open, and so I ran for that.</sentence><sentence id="1851">And I won the primary, but I lost the election.</sentence><sentence id="1852">Some of that experience was anti- Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="1853">I had -- I had some anti-Semitic experiences.</sentence><sentence id="1854">I'm not saying that's why I lost, but the fact is -- what happened was 30 days before the election a third candidate entered and he, on Thursday before the election he called a news conference saying that Max Heller is not fit to serve because he does not believe in Christ.</sentence><sentence id="1855">And when you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, in time of need, who are you going to call on?</sentence><sentence id="1856">And I -- I thought this was ridiculous, everybody knew that I was Jewish, and -- and I -- I really -- I said -- my response was that people are not going to believe any of -- I mean, make this an issue.</sentence><sentence id="1857">My wife told me, she says, "You're making a mistake, you ought to really fight this hard."</sentence><sentence id="1858">I said, "Look, it's Thursday, the election is Tuesday."</sentence><sentence id="1859">Well, make a long story short, I -- I lost the election by maybe two percent, and then consequently I was asked by the governor of the state if | would serve as chairman of the state development board -- economic development, which is equivalent to secretary of commerce.</sentence><sentence id="1860">And I did that -- we did that, I should say, for four years.</sentence><sentence id="1861">And that was a very good experience.</sentence><sentence id="1862">And then consequently of course, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1863">We lived in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1864">Our children grew up, we -- we had wonderful, wonderful family.</sentence><sentence id="1865">We now have 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild, and two great-grandchildren on the way, and we have -- we had a wedding not long ago, one of our granddaughters.</sentence><sentence id="1866">We have another one coming up in four weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1867">We've been very fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="1868">We have good children, we have good grandchildren, and I must say that they -- if there's one thing that they have done that I am proud of, there is no intolerance, no bigotry in those children or grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="1869">None.</sentence><sentence id="1870">None whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And they've had some experiences where -- one of my grand -- one of my children came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> crying and says, so and so said that I</sentence><sentence id="1873">7 killed Christ.</sentence><sentence id="1874">But it didn't -- that did not change their lives.</sentence><sentence id="1875">So they grew up very, very good -- I have a lot of -- very, very much to be grateful for, and I am.</sentence><sentence id="1876">I am very grateful.</sentence><sentence id="1877">I've devoted, I'd say, the last 30 years of my life -- I should say we, because my wife is the same way, for the community.</sentence><sentence id="1878">And I've had no regrets to be out of business.</sentence><sentence id="1879">I got enough money when we sold the <span class="BUILDING">business</span> to manage it careful.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And we've had no [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1881">I'm not the richest man in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, I never want to be.</sentence><sentence id="1882">And we -- we thank every God -- every day that we are here, we are grateful.</sentence><sentence id="1883">And we've told that to -- to our children.</sentence><sentence id="1884">We tell it to -- we -- both my wife and I, we speak in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, we speak in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And I think it's important that people hear this message.</sentence><sentence id="1886">We often think that when we are dead, when this generation dies, it becomes a history in the books, or on videotape.</sentence><sentence id="1887">And I think that's one reason I consider it very important to do this interview, because this should not be forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="1888">I wish that we had today copies of interviews that were done hundreds of years ago.</sentence><sentence id="1889">All we have is mouth to ear, and written.</sentence><sentence id="1890">And somehow, written history is not as powerful as when you can see it, or hear it.</sentence><sentence id="1891">And I respect what is being done today, so that the -- the world should not forget.</sentence><sentence id="1892">There has to be a lesson in all of that.</sentence><sentence id="1893">I don't know -- we often wonder how -- how -- really, how did this happen?</sentence><sentence id="1894">We lost 90 people in the Holocaust, 90 of our family were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1895">One cousin survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1896">She and four of her siblings and her mother and father were alive until the day when the Americans -- and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, and the day when the Americans came in, the Nazis took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and ran over her family and everyone was killed except she.</sentence><sentence id="1897">How in the world?</sentence><sentence id="1898">How can we forget that?</sentence><sentence id="1899">And as I said before, these are the very same people, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and for that matter <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the Poles did their share of anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="1900">They had more <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1901">The Viennese loved music, and they -- they -- they produced some of the finest writers in the world, a -- the Germans did.</sentence><sentence id="1902">And these are the very same people who perfected the art of killing.</sentence><sentence id="1903">And</sentence><sentence id="1905">8 nobody can tell me that people didn't know about this.</sentence><sentence id="1906">When you think about it, hundreds and thousands of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, it took architects, it took engineers, it took builders, carpenters, guards, railroad conductors, truck drivers.</sentence><sentence id="1907">Millions of people were involved to commit this crime.</sentence><sentence id="1908">And nobody can tell me that people didn't know about it.</sentence><sentence id="1909">They should feel guilty.</sentence><sentence id="1910">The new generation of Germans, I really think, is trying to overcome this.</sentence><sentence id="1911">The Austrians have not learned quite as well.</sentence><sentence id="1912">And yet, I find it very disturbing that in an election not long ago in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, about 20 percent of the vote went to the Nazi movement.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And that's bothersome.</sentence><sentence id="1914">That's something that we need to be concerned about.</sentence><sentence id="1915">I -- I'd like to -- I think this could be the end of my -- of the interview, unless you have something else that you want to ask me.</sentence><sentence id="1916">I don't know how we as a people can impart to others that there is so much good in the world, and yet there is so much evil.</sentence><sentence id="1917">And what is so important, that the good overcomes the evil.</sentence><sentence id="1918">Good people can become bad, and I always say, find the good people, find those and protect them.</sentence><sentence id="1919">But also, speak up when you hear bigots.</sentence><sentence id="1920">And what we have to remember, hatred is hatred.</sentence><sentence id="1921">If there is hatred against minorities because of their color, it's the same as hatred because of religion.</sentence><sentence id="1922">And we, as Jews, especially those of us who survived, have a responsibility, we have a duty, if nothing else, to speak up.</sentence><sentence id="1923">Speak up and help others to overcome this.</sentence><sentence id="1924">If there is nothing else we've done, I think that that -- that has to be a mission.</sentence><sentence id="1925">So, we have not lost faith, we have not lost faith in people, and we have not lost in faith in our religion.</sentence><sentence id="1926">I feel very good with what I am.</sentence><sentence id="1927">And I'm very grateful.</sentence><sentence id="1928">And if my children or grandchildren, or great-grandchildren and my wife see this, I just want you know that I love you.</sentence></p></dialogue>

Trude and I, after we became engaged, we were looking for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we saw an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> we liked, and I did not hear from the real
