<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and, and according to my mother, everybody was my friend.</sentence><sentence id="46">I was a lonely child.</sentence><sentence id="47">I was all alone and I loved to be alone, but as soon as some other kids arrived and Mommy said I used to become a leader.</sentence><sentence id="48">I don't remember that at all.</sentence><sentence id="49">I just know I always had great time when kids came and while -- as I told you before, I was six.</sentence><sentence id="50">My father was sort of a crazy man.</sentence><sentence id="51">He wanted to give anything to his child.</sentence><sentence id="52">That time back in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to get some clowns to come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> cost a fortune, but that's how I got the friends because the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> -- every child would come -- 50, 60 of them you know.</sentence><sentence id="53">But then all that stopped and I was alone, but I never felt lonely.</sentence><sentence id="54">I was always a great dreamer.</sentence><sentence id="55">I was always full of dreams.</sentence><sentence id="56">And since I was a little girl I like to put everything down on paper.</sentence><sentence id="57">Of course, eventually I lost them all naturally.</sentence><sentence id="58">But I was</sentence><sentence id="60">always writing.</sentence><sentence id="61">Then when it came up to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>.... Well, I, | remember one thing that my father was an absolutely unreligious.</sentence><sentence id="62">He said he was agnostic.</sentence><sentence id="63">He was in the Jewish faith, but he ran away from his bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="64">That much what he didn't believe in anything.</sentence><sentence id="65">And so he never taught me anything either, but my mother was a little bit more religious and she used to put on the Friday night candles.</sentence><sentence id="66">That was about as much religion as I got because my father would take me, say, "Come.</sentence><sentence id="67">Let Mommy give us a blessing."</sentence><sentence id="68">And I went without a word.</sentence><sentence id="69">Then as I grew I went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because I was a very pretty girl and all the boys were there on Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="70">So it was fun more than religion because I didn't know that I really should be.</sentence><sentence id="71">And then when it came to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>, then my father decided to put me in a Reformed Church Protestant school.</sentence><sentence id="72">And my mother first asked him, "Why you want her to go there?"</sentence><sentence id="73">And my father said, "Because that is the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and she will get the best education."</sentence><sentence id="74">And I remembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady principal and she would turn to my father and said, "Mr. Mandl, why do you want your little girl to come to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="75">We have no Jewish children."</sentence><sentence id="76">And my father said, "I don't like bigots.</sentence><sentence id="77">I want my child to think for herself, and yours is the best <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>."</sentence><sentence id="78">So she smiled and she looked at me, says, "Would you like to come to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="79">And I looked her and I fall in love with her at once, I said, "Yes, I do."</sentence><sentence id="80">So then she explained to my father that a couple of children are there, but they are not allowed to come to morning services.</sentence><sentence id="81">Every morning they had a ten minute service, one prayer and two songs.</sentence><sentence id="82">And right away I picked up, "I can sing?"</sentence><sentence id="83">That was it.</sentence><sentence id="84">But the Protestant teacher, the religious teacher was a wonderful lady, another wonderful woman.</sentence><sentence id="85">She was about six foot tall with very black hair and a huge heart and I was like a half pension!</sentence><sentence id="86">in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> until seven because both of my parents worked and she used to take me and she was the one who taught me about Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="87">And she said, "You have to learn because that was the first religion in the world.</sentence><sentence id="88">And you have to learn some Hebrew."</sentence><sentence id="89">So whatever I know, I know from her.</sentence><sentence id="90">But I was the first and then we got more children so I was there through <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> and <span class="BUILDING">senior high</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">And I graduated except that I wasn't there on graduation because I got scarlet fever.</sentence><sentence id="92">And I missed the graduation where I was supposed to be a hostess and that hurt me.</sentence><sentence id="93">The only little Jewish kid that could have been the hostess, she couldn't be there.</sentence><sentence id="94">But that's how life is.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite wealthy and our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always open and they -- more Christians and Aristocrats came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I never felt that I was different from anyone else.</sentence><sentence id="150">And also we traveled quite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">My mother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there " Boarding-school student (French)</sentence><sentence id="153">and so we, we went a lot to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">And I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of.</sentence><sentence id="155">So in "36 I was at the -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the Olympic games because my very best friend -- and if you ever read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their guest through the Olympics.</sentence><sentence id="156">And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running.</sentence><sentence id="157">Flying, not running.</sentence><sentence id="158">And I was so proud and I screamed for him.</sentence><sentence id="159">And it was a very interesting time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the Nazism as much as they really were.</sentence><sentence id="160">They didn't like the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="161">They didn't like Jesse Owens because he was black.</sentence><sentence id="162">They didn't like some other people because they were another color, like Japanese, but still it was not bad.</sentence><sentence id="163">And we had a wonderful time and I met a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, "What religion you are?"</sentence><sentence id="164">and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time.</sentence><sentence id="165">Coming back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through part of <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion.</sentence><sentence id="167">"You are a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="168">We don't want you."</sentence><sentence id="169">But I managed, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">So because of that I happened to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and I really had Madam Montessori" teaching me just before she died.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: What was she like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: She was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="199">She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry for today's <span class="BUILDING">Montessori schools</span> because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally retarded, to learn to do things by themselves -- to dress by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="200">And today they turned this all out.</sentence><sentence id="201">Today they have <span class="BUILDING">Montessori schools</span> where the kids have to be quiet.</sentence><sentence id="202">That is not for our children.</sentence><sentence id="203">The children have to let out.</sentence><sentence id="204">But hers was a natural thing.</sentence><sentence id="205">She didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children.</sentence><sentence id="206">And it was a most wonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their shoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="207">And also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> they are bored.</sentence><sentence id="208">Because in <span class="BUILDING">Montessori school</span> most of them already learn how to write, how to count, how to do things.</sentence><sentence id="209">And it makes children very difficult to grow up.</sentence><sentence id="210">But it was a great experience to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">I love <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">And she lived out in, in a not such a good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> either, but her whole life was the children and the teaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world.</sentence><sentence id="213">So I do have my Montessori diploma.</sentence><sentence id="214">And then from there I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because I wanted to learn the King's English in a real good way and I did.</sentence><sentence id="215">Now, of course, I lost it all.</sentence><sentence id="216">Waited all the &gt; Maria Montessori</sentence><sentence id="218">years where I lived in different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, it came off.</sentence><sentence id="219">And after <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that was already "39.</sentence><sentence id="220">And then I decided I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> again.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="330">That's right.</sentence><sentence id="331">I will never forget that day as long as I live.</sentence><sentence id="332">Early morning one of our neighbors running and said to my Father, "The

it."</sentence><sentence id="337">My father said, "You are too young.</sentence><sentence id="338">You don't understand."</sentence><sentence id="339">And sure enough, Horthy came on and he went as far as to say, "And we are now the friends of the Allies," and at that moment the Germans -- the Hitler's hymn came on and they cut off his voice and I just dropped my glass.</sentence><sentence id="340">And I left to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Ritz Hotel</span> where I was working there and I also -- because I couldn't have no Montessori, nothing worked that time, so I worked in the

of all, it was full with beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">It was a very sunny day.</sentence><sentence id="348">And I was sure that they were the

you.</sentence><sentence id="353">Horthy was arrested, and these are not the Americans and British.</sentence><sentence id="354">These are the Russians -- these are the Germans -- excuse me, the Russians came after.</sentence><sentence id="355">So I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my father's only words were, "You were right."</sentence><sentence id="356">And funnily enough, we were not collected from our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">We heard that we have to put on a star, so we did that.</sentence><sentence id="358">We didn't go out much on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, but we still were not restricted.</sentence><sentence id="359">Nothing!</sentence><sentence id="360">But they came in and immediately we heard that many, many, many people were taken and we still were not even touched.</sentence><sentence id="361">Nothing!</sentence><sentence id="362">Whether we were lucky, I don't know but we were in the <span

Letters still arrived from Europe, and I had a correspondence with a Swedish gentlemen for a long time because in a long time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> when you were a girl, who spoke lot of languages and you were a girl scout, then they asked you to be a guide for tourists.</sentence><sentence id="474">And as I spoke lot of languages, once I was a guide for a whole Swedish group.</sentence><sentence id="475">And the one Swedish man started to write.</sentence><sentence id="476">He has written for years and years.</sentence><sentence id="477">We were corresponding.</sentence><sentence id="478">I didn't think of anything.</sentence><sentence id="479">I was young and I had a lot of young men around me and all that so I just thought, "How nice.</sentence><sentence id="480">This nice Swedish man never forget</sentence><sentence id="482">a young kid.</sentence><sentence id="483">And actually he saved my life before Raoul, but I didn't know that then.</sentence><sentence id="484">So in any case one day -- that was very frightening experience -- finally, the bell rang.</sentence><sentence id="485">And I look out and there is a German soldier standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">And I look back at my parents.</sentence><sentence id="487">Well, we couldn't not open the <span class="DLF">door</span>, but then I looked again.</sentence><sentence id="488">I said, "Oh, my God, I know him."</sentence><sentence id="489">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in 1936, we exchanged cards and he happened to be one of the soldiers coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="490">And my name evidently didn't mean a thing -- that a Mandl could be German.</sentence><sentence id="491">He didn't think I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="492">And I said to my parents, "What shall I do?"</sentence><sentence id="493">He said, "Well, you have to open the <span class="DLF">door</span>."</sentence><sentence id="494">He didn't want to come in, thank God.</sentence><sentence id="495">He just said would I show him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>?</sentence><sentence id="496">And I was afraid if I say, "No," or, "Why he was sent here?"</sentence><sentence id="497">It was a very bad feeling so I turned around to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="498">I said, "I'm going to show him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>."</sentence><sentence id="499">And I went out.</sentence><sentence id="500">All I heard is my father said, "Be careful."</sentence><sentence id="501">I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="502">What else could I say?</sentence><sentence id="503">So I went and everything went alright for about an hour and then we came to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he stopped me there and he said, "You see.</sentence><sentence id="504">That's where I'm going to kill everybody."</sentence><sentence id="505">So now I didn't know whether I should open a big mouth and tell him who I am or shall I ask a question.</sentence><sentence id="506">So I quickly thought, "Maybe I'll ask a question."</sentence><sentence id="507">I said, "Did ever a Jew hurt you?</sentence><sentence id="508">Did you know any?"</sentence><sentence id="509">He said, "I never knew any."</sentence><sentence id="510">I said, "Well, then, why do you want to kill people whom you never even met."</sentence><sentence id="511">He said, "Hitler told me to do it, and I am a German."</sentence><sentence id="512">So I quickly looked at my watch and I said, "Oh, you'll have to forgive me, but I have to teach English and I forgot that the time has come.</sentence><sentence id="513">Goodbye."</sentence><sentence id="514">And he let me go and I run.</sentence><sentence id="515">I never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="516">I have no idea what happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="517">But it was a close call.</sentence><sentence id="518">Yeah, because I really didn't know how to behave.</sentence><sentence id="519">So then we were all always frightened and then suddenly these two French gentlemen arrived with a note who send them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="520">The two French men arrived and they're not supposed to say it, but they said they were French Underground and could we put them up in our <span

wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="523">One was a peasant and one was a very learned young man.</sentence><sentence id="524">One was a Jew, one was a Christian.</sentence><sentence id="525">And they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and one of them fall in love with my wonderful girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="526">He was unmarried.</sentence><sentence id="527">But they went in and out and they did wonderful things.</sentence><sentence id="528">I guess they were couriers between <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for the Allies and for <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and it's a very exciting time you know.</sentence><sentence id="529">Frightening, but when you're young, all you can think, "I have to survive.</sentence><sentence id="530">I have to survive."</sentence><sentence id="531">So now in the midst of all this, then came this announcement.</sentence><sentence id="532">The first day was that any couples mixed marriages have to separate at once or the Christian party is becoming a Jew and being killed.</sentence><sentence id="533">Well, within a half an hour, there were thousands of suicides.</sentence><sentence id="534">It's a very easy way to kill people.</sentence><sentence id="535">And then they reversed it and they said we changed our minds, but by that time thousands of people died.</sentence><sentence id="536">Thank God, my aunt and uncle called.</sentence><sentence id="537">My uncle was a grandson of a Unitarian bishop and he was a newspaper man and it was a wonderful marriage.</sentence><sentence id="538">And they called and they said they're going to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="539">I said, "No, you're not Uncle.</sentence><sentence id="540">Why don't you get some false papers and just disappear."</sentence><sentence id="541">Said, "I never thought of this."</sentence><sentence id="542">I said, "Well, then think."</sentence><sentence id="543">And they</sentence><sentence id="545">survived.</sentence><sentence id="546">He died after the war, natural death, both of them.</sentence><sentence id="547">But many of them didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="548">Then came the announcement that anyone who not having the Jewish religion can be saved.</sentence><sentence id="549">They just talked you know.</sentence><sentence id="550">It was -- nothing was now, but we

overlooking the <span class="DLF">rose garden</span> and I found out I wasn't the only guest in the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="905">First, there was that famous Nobel

like where we were on with my parents, that became a <span class="BUILDING">Christian house</span>, so my parents had to get out.</sentence><sentence id="930">And thank God, my grandmother had a big

moved in.</sentence><sentence id="931">And Steven came every day, so we had two Christians helping us.</sentence><sentence id="932">And that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> became a <span

not there, and my name is still on, then they would kill my parents."</sentence><sentence id="933">So they had a little argument and the Minister said, "No, because we are

should have one of the employees will go and sit on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> because they want to know exactly where I'm going.</sentence><sentence id="938">So I went down with the

left.</sentence><sentence id="943">And of course, my welcome <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was not so good.</sentence><sentence id="944">I felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that

id="946">I mean you have only one life.</sentence><sentence id="947">But I was back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="948">And I called up every day and I think I wasn't down longer than a weeks and a half and I called and a Hungarian secretary came Mezey and said, "Agnes, you have to get up here at once.</sentence><sentence id="949">Something new

long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1065">I mean there were maids who used to work in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1066">They walked in and they took the former employers fur coats and everything and they walked for breakfast with big furs and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1067">They had no idea, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And they took all the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> from everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1069">Yeah?</sentence><sentence id="1070">So he said, "Get to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and get your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back."</sentence><sentence id="1071">What I didn't even remember, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was written on my father's name, but I looked at him by that time and I got -- you saw right away my, my identification from them.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Actually, everybody in that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> needed an identification, even a shoe cleaner on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, because otherwise you couldn't walk around.</sentence><sentence id="1073">This was wartime.</sentence><sentence id="1074">And so I got mine.</sentence><sentence id="1075">You have them I think or you will have them.</sentence><sentence id="1076">And I walked in with my head absolutely high because now I was a Wallenberg girl.</sentence><sentence id="1077">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1078">And I walked in and I sort of threw my paper to, to the head.</sentence><sentence id="1079">I said, "What can happen?</sentence><sentence id="1080">Either he shoots me or not."</sentence><sentence id="1081">And he looked at me awfully ugly and without a word he signed and gave it back to me.</sentence><sentence id="1082">I said, "Oh, oh.</sentence><sentence id="1083">Raoul, whom did you bribe again?"</sentence><sentence id="1084">Something must have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1085">But I got out.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Somebody I heard yelling, "There is a bloody Jew going," but I just went with my head up right to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1087">And I walk in and there is a -- that was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and the superintendent is there and I walk in and he was so stunned that I am alive.</sentence><sentence id="1088">You know they had no idea what happened to us.</sentence><sentence id="1089">And I said, "Hello," and his wife started to cry because I loved her very much, but he was a leech.</sentence><sentence id="1090">He lived on us for years and he looks at me and he said, "What do you want?"</sentence><sentence id="1091">I said, "Here.</sentence><sentence id="1092">My <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back!"</sentence><sentence id="1093">He said, "My daughter already has that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1094">Whereby the wife says, "No, our daughter has already another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1095">So I don't know what he did to his wife after, but I said, "I like to have the receipt official."</sentence><sentence id="1096">So he said, "Well, you have to go to our lawyer and he should give it back to you."</sentence><sentence id="1097">I said, "Look, where is the lawyer living?"</sentence><sentence id="1098">I went to the lawyer and as soon as I walked in, the lawyer looked at the paper and he saw it was official so not much he could do and he said, "Yes, but that has a price."</sentence><sentence id="1099">And I thought, "Oh, my God.</sentence><sentence id="1100">If I have to give him money, I don't have."</sentence><sentence id="1101">And I said, "Well, what's the price?"</sentence><sentence id="1102">And he said, "You will have to testify that I was so good to the Jewish people."</sentence><sentence id="1103">They all wanted that by that time, of course, because whoever comes in, they would have hanged them because they killed thousands of them on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1104">I saw it myself one day this green shirt.</sentence><sentence id="1105">There was a little boy of two years old with a star, and he just -- "bang" and killed him.</sentence><sentence id="1106">No reason to kill a child of two years.</sentence><sentence id="1107">But he had a yellow star on, why not kill?</sentence><sentence id="1108">So in any case, I promised him anything and in the meantime my finger was like this [interviewee gestures] in the back.</sentence><sentence id="1109">I, "The hell with you all, just give it to me."</sentence><sentence id="1110">So I walked back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1111">Now he couldn't say anything,</sentence><sentence id="1113">3 because the lawyer signed.</sentence><sentence id="1114">So we go upstairs and I had a very horrible feeling, "What will I find?"</sentence><sentence id="1115">I found an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> except we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">maid's room</span> was locked, and all that and we opened.</sentence><sentence id="1116">All our stuff was in there, the paintings, the books, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, and for a moment I thought to myself, "Gee, He isn't as bad as I thought," until he opened his mouth and he said, "I'll get even with you yet."</sentence><sentence id="1117">But I figured the -- in this ball game, the ball is now in my <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1118">And I got my telephone back within a day and I had our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back and I had a telephone, so I was in constant contact with Raoul and everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Now I wanted my parents badly to get out of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span>, and I screamed up.</sentence><sentence id="1121">I shouldn't have done it, but I was so excited.</sentence><sentence id="1122">I said, "We got the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back again, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> back."</sentence><sentence id="1123">In the meantime, Raoul, as he promised, he got my parents some papers.</sentence><sentence id="1124">They're not supposed to come out of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but I said, "Out!</sentence><sentence id="1125">Out!</sentence><sentence id="1126"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span>!"</sentence><sentence id="1127">And I took them out.</sentence><sentence id="1128">I missed them and also my cousins.</sentence><sentence id="1129">Her mother couldn't come then.</sentence><sentence id="1130">I don't know where she was.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And I took them all out.</sentence><sentence id="1132">My cousin had papers from Salvadorian papers and the Swiss family helped her so we all went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And then we started the big work with Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1134">That time I was--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1236">Q: Excuse me, won't you?</sentence><sentence id="1237">Would you pause a minute?</sentence><sentence id="1238">Tell me you, when you said when you met Raoul Wallenberg, you seemed to know all about him.</sentence><sentence id="1239">Did you know about him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1244">A: Nothing!</sentence><sentence id="1245">All I knew is that there is a young man and I said to myself, "What is he doing?"</sentence><sentence id="1246">And first I think and that was the feeling that he thought it was an adventure.</sentence><sentence id="1247">But he found out in one day, half a day, that this wasn't an adventure.</sentence><sentence id="1248">This is something that you need.</sentence><sentence id="1249">And he was a most fantastic organizer.</sentence><sentence id="1250">A quick thinker!</sentence><sentence id="1251">His first question was from -- he had one friend and that was Per Anger, whom I don't know if you interviewed yet, but Per Anger was then the First Secretary of the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1252">And he was an old friend of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> and he asked him the first moment, "What have you done for the people here?"</sentence><sentence id="1253">Because it was not only Jews, but it was also anti-Nazi, aristocrats, and Christians, whom he had to help.</sentence><sentence id="1254">It was not just the Jews, but mostly.</sentence><sentence id="1255">And they said, "We have given out 800 real <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passports</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1256">Now that was what I had, too.</sentence><sentence id="1257">And Raoul was beside himself. "</sentence><sentence id="1258">Two hundred -- two -- 2,8000 -- no, 280,000 people, you give 800 pass-passports?</sentence><sentence id="1259">Well, that's nothing."</sentence><sentence id="1260">And from the first day on, he actually took over the whole <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1261">The Minister didn't like it very much because after all, he was a diplomat and he was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1262">And when he asked him -- he came as a third secretary -- he had to have a diplomatic passport because otherwise, he couldn't travel.</sentence><sentence id="1263">And he said, "Mr. Danielsson, you'll have to understand that when you go and argue with the people, you speak as a diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="1264">I don't."</sentence><sentence id="1265">And that's how he wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1266">He was like a devil.</sentence><sentence id="1269">4 You know to us, he spoke like the greatest brother, like a little child, and he was full of jokes all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1270">And when we were a little bit down, then he would come up with jokes or he would imitate Mussolini"?</sentence><sentence id="1271">or he would imitate Hitler or Eichmann."?</sentence><sentence id="1272">Whatever he could make us laugh, he made us hysterically laugh because that was his whole nature.</sentence><sentence id="1273">What he felt <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, we don't know because he never showed.</sentence><sentence id="1274">The only thing I knew that he was deathly afraid and that was the bombs because that he couldn't hide.</sentence><sentence id="1275">But we all were afraid from that and he said now, "Whatever happens," because when the Americans come, when they bombed, it went all the way through to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1276">When the Russians came the two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> upstairs disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1277">One was our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1278">It's not all bombed out you know, but with the Americans it went, and it didn't matter whether it was the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">Christians houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1279">Bombed!</sentence><sentence id="1280">And that was it, and the British too.</sentence><sentence id="1281">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> took over immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was like a wildfire that there is some "angel" who is here to help.</sentence><sentence id="1283">So the Jewish Community and those of anti-Nazi Christians, they all came and Raoul -- in two days we had 350 people helping.</sentence><sentence id="1284">And we didn't get paid as you always hear, "He's a paid employee."</sentence><sentence id="1285">Nobody was paid.</sentence><sentence id="1286">We were paid because we had our wonderful identification, but quite a lot from our 350 people died and were taken and were killed, so those who were -- we were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1287">Some of them didn't kill.</sentence><sentence id="1288">Not because that they all say that that was saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="1289">It did not save our lives.</sentence><sentence id="1290">It was a part of our work with him.</sentence><sentence id="1291">We belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1292">And it was funny because the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> only had 12 employees and Raoul had 350 in days, but he needed it.</sentence><sentence id="1293">And in no time, he opened a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and he was looking.</sentence><sentence id="1294">There was lots of doctors who were hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1295">He found them, and they worked for him and the Red Cross nurses and the other nurses, and many of them died and many of them lived and helped him "til the last moment.</sentence><sentence id="1296">But he was, he was never for a moment without thinking, "what can I do next?"</sentence><sentence id="1297">And he was like a machine, you know "Go!</sentence><sentence id="1298">Go!</sentence><sentence id="1299">Go!"</sentence><sentence id="1300">And so all of us became like this.</sentence><sentence id="1301">I also slept sometimes one or two hours a night because there was no time.</sentence><sentence id="1302">We always had to do something because there were always something new what Eichmann was thinking of and especially the Arrow Cross.</sentence><sentence id="1303">So not only that we had these helpers but we had quite a few very rich people and they offered Raoul their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1304">So we did in two weeks -- we had about 60 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the two sides of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span>, where the Swedish flag went on and we had Nazi-clad, Nazi-clad Hungarian, Jewish boys standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> taking care of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and nobody could step in because it was a <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1305">And Per Anger writes it in his book and he says that at that time -- because in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, they always made jokes whether there was a war or not -- that the Swedish government was the greatest landlord in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1306">And we had those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and it was good because our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> had to move every day because they were after us.</sentence><sentence id="1307">Eichmann " Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini 3 Adolf Eichmann</sentence><sentence id="1309">5 was after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> all the time, but he was not afraid from Eichmann.</sentence><sentence id="1310">He invited him for dinner, and then he forgot about it, and he had to call the <span class="BUILDING">Swiss Embassy</span> -- a Swedish guy, and he said, "Do you have any wine and food?</sentence><sentence id="1311">I forgot I invited Eichmann for dinner."</sentence><sentence id="1312">But he not only invited Eichmann for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="1313">He asked one of the Jewish helpers to serve him so it would be fun to see how he reacts to somebody with the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="1314">And we did it because it was fun.</sentence><sentence id="1315">Raoul wanted it.</sentence><sentence id="1316">But at that time we were already bombed heavily, and Raoul had shirt open, and this guy here arrived with all the guns around him, but he couldn't kill Raoul on the <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span> you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1395">Q: Let's stop here.</sentence><sentence id="1396">Let's back up.</sentence><sentence id="1397">What do you mean?</sentence><sentence id="1398">Which guy arrived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1403">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eichmann</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1405">Q: Oh.</sentence><sentence id="1406">Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1409">A: With, with a soldier and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1410">And Raoul -- it was already no light, we had only candlelights -- and Raoul opened the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and it was the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> was burning.</sentence><sentence id="1411">And he said, "Eichmann, look out.</sentence><sentence id="1412">Look what you're doing?"</sentence><sentence id="1413">And Eichmann said, "They deserve it."</sentence><sentence id="1414">He said, "Stop talking and stop killing the people.</sentence><sentence id="1415">You didn't win.</sentence><sentence id="1416">The Germans lost, so give up."</sentence><sentence id="1417">And Eichmann said, "No, I will not give up and my only thing is that you are in my way."</sentence><sentence id="1418">And Raoul very quietly said, "But I am not enough in your way."</sentence><sentence id="1419">He just didn't take it seriously.</sentence><sentence id="1420">And then Eichmann left.</sentence><sentence id="1421">But he had to have his say and he had to show it to him, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1422">I wish he would be there when Eichmann had to be hanged or whatever they did to him.</sentence><sentence id="1423">Unfortunately, he probably doesn't even know about it.</sentence><sentence id="1424">So any case, it was wild because I was for awhile -- I was just hostessing, you know, because thousands of people came up to us for the Schutz-pass!*</sentence><sentence id="1425">what was also his design.</sentence><sentence id="1426">He designed -- first, he went to the Hungarian and said, "Are there still <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going between here and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1427">I'd like to take the Jews off your hand," he said.</sentence><sentence id="1428">And they said, "Yes, Mr. Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1429">You can take 5,000 people."</sentence><sentence id="1430">So he came back to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1431">He says, "5,000 and they will never allow me another one."</sentence><sentence id="1432">So that's no good.</sentence><sentence id="1433">So then he designed this Schutz-pass.</sentence><sentence id="1434">And, of course, with 350 people we had millions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the Minister sat and signed each of them.</sentence><sentence id="1435">Now I am afraid you will hear many times they said they were fake papers.</sentence><sentence id="1436">Not one of them were ever fake.</sentence><sentence id="1437">If they say it was too many, yes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably made 50,000 of it.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Alright?</sentence><sentence id="1439">But they were not fake because everyone of them is signed by the Swedish Minister.</sentence><sentence id="1440">What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three years Underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he had a little printing machine and he figured he will come to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and see what he can help there.</sentence><sentence id="1441">And there he had Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1442">And he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed "Danielsson" and 4 Protective pass (German)</sentence><sentence id="1444">6 some people found it.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And they called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry.</sentence><sentence id="1446">He said, "You can't do that."</sentence><sentence id="1447">But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, "But if you can save one single life, go ahead and do it."</sentence><sentence id="1448">So very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like Raoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one.</sentence><sentence id="1449">But it was not Raoul's papers.</sentence><sentence id="1450">They were not fake, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1451">And these people just don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1452">He did.</sentence><sentence id="1453">Also, they say he gave us passports.</sentence><sentence id="1454">He never gave passports.</sentence><sentence id="1455">It was a pass, and the pass and if you will read my book, you will see it.</sentence><sentence id="1456">I have it translated.</sentence><sentence id="1457">The picture of the person is on there, with the signature, and it says, "The above, the bearer of this paper is protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings."</sentence><sentence id="1458">And if and when we collectively can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, then they will be going and then in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in 14 days this paper will be invalid.</sentence><sentence id="1459">It doesn't say <span class="NPIP">anywhere</span> it's a passport.</sentence><sentence id="1460">It doesn't say anywhere that he can take his star off.</sentence><sentence id="1461">It just says he's protected by the Swedish government.</sentence><sentence id="1462">And then when these people had to be shifted out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, then Raoul just picked them up and in these 60 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> we put them in.</sentence><sentence id="1463">These were our safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and it was not comfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1464">Raoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to go in the meantime on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1465">Now, on the <span class="DLF">road</span> he didn't take us girls.</sentence><sentence id="1466">He took the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> and he took some of the diplomats.</sentence><sentence id="1467">And by that time he called up the Swiss diplomat and said, "Help me.</sentence><sentence id="1468">We need some help.</sentence><sentence id="1469">We need you people doing this."</sentence><sentence id="1470">So then we got the Swiss involved.</sentence><sentence id="1471">We got the Portuguese involved.</sentence><sentence id="1472">We got the Papal Nuncio involved very nicely.</sentence><sentence id="1473">And so he had enough men to go with him including Thomas Veres, who was always with him.</sentence><sentence id="1474">He was a young boy with a camera hidden and he made all these pictures.</sentence><sentence id="1475">And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because they were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul and he would shout, "Raoul, jump.</sentence><sentence id="1476">They're killing you."</sentence><sentence id="1477">And Raoul jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they left.</sentence><sentence id="1478">But he went out after the people all the way to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> to get the people back.</sentence><sentence id="1479">With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="1480">As I said, it was the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't know -- and you said, you've never been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1481">Between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> -- the <span class="DLF">border</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, that was then a five hour <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ride, and they were walking these people in the snow without shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1482">Children, sick people, old people, and they died, and people trampled over them.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And Raoul was beside himself.</sentence><sentence id="1484">So he went on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and one day Per Anger had met him and Raoul had -- have we finished?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1593">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1594">I was telling that Raoul went after these people all the way to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1595">But one of these occasions he had Per Anger with him too, and he had a big black book and on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, he stopped and screamed at the Nazis in German.</sentence><sentence id="1596">He spoke perfect German. "</sentence><sentence id="1597">How dare you are taking our people.</sentence><sentence id="1598">They're all our protected people.</sentence><sentence id="1599">And all of those people, who have my papers turn around."</sentence><sentence id="1600">And one of my very good girlfriends from here now, she said, "Well, what can happen?</sentence><sentence id="1601">They'll kill her anyhow."</sentence><sentence id="1602">She turned around.</sentence><sentence id="1603">She didn't have any paper -- and her sister and her mother.</sentence><sentence id="1604">And "Get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1605">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1606">And then he started to open his black book and started to read names like a machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="1607">And people caught on, those who could still walk and they walked up whether that was their name or not, and he brought about thousand people back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to these safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And on the way <span

id="1610">And Raoul started hysterically laughing and he said, "I'll show it to you when I done it."</sentence><sentence id="1611">And he opens it up and not one single name.</sentence><sentence id="1612">Nothing!</sentence><sentence id="1613">But that was his idea.</sentence><sentence id="1614">He had to do something.</sentence><sentence id="1615">He had to save people.</sentence><sentence id="1616">And the same thing, he had drivers licenses and insurance papers, whatever he could find in Hungarian, what the Germans couldn't read.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And he took it all the way to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he demanded to open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and he yelled to the people, "I have your papers here.</sentence><sentence id="1618">Get out, Mr. So and So."</sentence><sentence id="1619">And there to some people, you know, "Aw, maybe we can get away."</sentence><sentence id="1620">And he handed them -- some of them got the Schutz-pass, not with their name, but who cares, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1621">And insurance papers and tax papers.</sentence><sentence id="1622">You name it.</sentence><sentence id="1623">He brought them back.</sentence><sentence id="1624">But I don't know if you saw the film.</sentence><sentence id="1625">There was one and that was the truth that he took home thousands and in the meantime they killed another thousand and you could hear it, but you can't save everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1626">He always played with his own life because he can be killed any moment, but he didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="1627">He just wanted the people.</sentence><sentence id="1628">Once he was about 250 young men was taken and they were told that they will clean up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> from the bombing and he knew exactly that's not true.</sentence><sentence id="1629">So he went after them, again just with two of his colleagues, and again a lot of paper and this Nazi looks at him and he knew who he was and he said, "Wallenberg, if there is one man who doesn't have a paper, I kill him on the spot."</sentence><sentence id="1630">And Raoul looks at him and said, "That's fine.</sentence><sentence id="1631">You can kill him."</sentence><sentence id="1632">And from the 250, 249 already down, everybody had the paper and one give him eye contact with Raoul.</sentence><sentence id="1633">Was a doctor, and he is in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> today.</sentence><sentence id="1634">And Raoul understand immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1635">He had no idea what the man's name is and he says, "Johnny, you left your paper at my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> again."</sentence><sentence id="1636">And he handed him a paper and off they went.</sentence><sentence id="1639">9 Yeah?</sentence><sentence id="1640">But he always -- he came up with stories that, that you wouldn't believe that anyone can do.</sentence><sentence id="1641">Now we had this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> already.</sentence><sentence id="1642">And also it was full of patients and also full of doctors and nurses, and it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1643">It was already a very, very snowy day in the beginning of December, or end of November, and Raoul had one wonderful thing what I could never learn.</sentence><sentence id="1644">He remembered names, and once he had your name he would never forget.</sentence><sentence id="1645">I forget it in five minutes.</sentence><sentence id="1646">He never made a mistake, to call me Ava and somebody else Aggie.</sentence><sentence id="1647">He knew who was Aggie and he knew who was Ava.</sentence><sentence id="1648">No mistakes.</sentence><sentence id="1649">So what he wanted to do -- the Hungarian Nazi party, this horrible Arrow Cross, they had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in every section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1650">And he send out some little spy to learn every officer's name to be sure that he gets the right people.</sentence><sentence id="1651">And he never forgot those names, and he knew which one in which <span class="NPIP">section</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1652">One day he comes to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in this horrible snow and he was unshaven and probably hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1653">Who knows where he was, saving people.</sentence><sentence id="1654">And he comes in and he finds three little Hungarian punks.</sentence><sentence id="1655">I mean punks because they were 12 and 13 year old analphabets, but they gave them the gun and they said, "Kill."</sentence><sentence id="1656">If you tell that to a 12 year old, "Kill, then you won't get punished for it."</sentence><sentence id="1657">Why not?</sentence><sentence id="1658">So here they stand with the gun and the doctor's hand is up and the patients are shaking and Raoul --I was there, it so happened on that day -- and Raoul had to think very fast, and he hit these three kids.</sentence><sentence id="1659">I've never seen anybody hitting so strong.</sentence><sentence id="1660">Then he doesn't speak Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="1661">Only a few words, and somehow he managed to tell them in half German and half Hungarian, "Get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="1662">You are in a <span class="REGION">Swedish territory</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1663">And, of course, the guns fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1664">So we had three guns in no time.</sentence><sentence id="1665">And he said, "Get your officers in here."</sentence><sentence id="1666">These three boys ran out.</sentence><sentence id="1667">I mean, they were little kids and they were frightened because he was just powerful.</sentence><sentence id="1668">In three minutes, an officer walks in, a Hungarian, and they all spoke some German.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And our Raoul as quiet as nothing happened, looked at his watch and says, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?"</sentence><sentence id="1670">And the guy looks up and says, "How'd you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?"</sentence><sentence id="1671">He knew.</sentence><sentence id="1672">And Raoul pushed up his shoulders and he said, "I know everybody's name and besides you are in big trouble."</sentence><sentence id="1673">He says, "I am not in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="1674">You are."</sentence><sentence id="1675">He says, "No, you are because by mistake you killed a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you." "</sentence><sentence id="1676">No, I never killed anyone." "</sentence><sentence id="1677">Yes, you did.</sentence><sentence id="1678">He died here in our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And before he died, he asked us to call the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and your name is up at the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1680">They're killing you.</sentence><sentence id="1681">So get out and bring me what I ask you.</sentence><sentence id="1682">Medication!</sentence><sentence id="1683">And maybe I will help you."</sentence><sentence id="1684">Without a word the guy ran out.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And all of us looked at Raoul, you know, and the doctor start laughing.</sentence><sentence id="1686">He says, "Raoul, what the hell did you just do?"</sentence><sentence id="1687">And Raoul says, "Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1688">Nothing."</sentence><sentence id="1689">He said, "How did you know it was Simon."</sentence><sentence id="1690">He said, "I didn't know he was Simon, but that's the name of the officer there and we were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1691">It was Simon."</sentence><sentence id="1692">And then the doctor looked at him again and he says, "Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here dying."</sentence><sentence id="1693">He said, "Naturally not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been."</sentence><sentence id="1694">You see, now that was the way he saved.</sentence><sentence id="1695">It could have been a trouble for him at all times.</sentence><sentence id="1696">He did the same thing when he saved 70,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="1699">0 We had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1700">A real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1701">And that was just about on the end when the Russians were already outside the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and Eichmann laughed many times, "Kill everybody," and they put up the guns.</sentence><sentence id="1702">Now by that time, we had quite a few Nazis who wanted to save their life and the Hungarian Arrow Cross and they helped Raoul and one of them came to him one day and he said, "Go immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1703">Eichmann put up the bombs, and they're going to kill the 70,000 people."</sentence><sentence id="1704">And Raoul says very quietly, "Oh, gosh and just our two Red Cross girls are in there delivering medicine and food."</sentence><sentence id="1705">He says, "Get back to your <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and tell them that the Germans called off the killing."</sentence><sentence id="1706">And now it's not like in the film.</sentence><sentence id="1707">In the film, he went himself to them.</sentence><sentence id="1708">But it's not so.</sentence><sentence id="1709">We were all in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and like a little child he says, "Now, listen to what I'm going to do."</sentence><sentence id="1710">He picks up the phone and with his gorgeous German, he calls the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, and he said, "This is Lieutenant Krauss(ph)."</sentence><sentence id="1711">Okay? "</sentence><sentence id="1712">I want to talk to" --I think Veesenmayer!</sentence><sentence id="1713">&gt; was the General's name.</sentence><sentence id="1714">I can't remember it.</sentence><sentence id="1715">And in the meantime, he constantly looks at us, you know, and we all started laughing because he just made a joke.</sentence><sentence id="1716">And when the General came to the phone, he said, "This is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1717">Of course, he couldn't hang up on him.</sentence><sentence id="1718">And he said, "I really astonished what you are doing.</sentence><sentence id="1719">I understand you are a very highly decorated First World Officer.</sentence><sentence id="1720">How can you take it on your conscious to kill 70,000 innocent people, plus my two Swedish girls who are in there now?"</sentence><sentence id="1721">Whereby he must have answered, "Eichmann ordered," because our Raoul said, "Eichmann?</sentence><sentence id="1722">Didn't you know he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1723">I had lunch with him yesterday."</sentence><sentence id="1724">That was a complete lie.</sentence><sentence id="1725">Now you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="1726">Eichmann could have stood right beside that general, but he has to risk it because there were 70,000 people's lives on the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1727">Whereby he answered, "I didn't know."</sentence><sentence id="1728">He said, "Alright.</sentence><sentence id="1729">Then, I order you to call off the killing, because if not then I as a diplomat promise you that you will be hanged before your officers."</sentence><sentence id="1730">He hung up.</sentence><sentence id="1731">In two minutes, he called off the killing.</sentence><sentence id="1732">And we have quite a few old people today like that who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1733">They didn't know until today who saved them.</sentence><sentence id="1734">So you see, his life was all -- what he was there.</sentence><sentence id="1735">He was lying.</sentence><sentence id="1736">He was cheating.</sentence><sentence id="1737">He was bribing.</sentence><sentence id="1738">But that was the only way.</sentence><sentence id="1739">He did millions of things.</sentence><sentence id="1740">I mean by that time we had our guns too and he dressed his boys up.</sentence><sentence id="1741">They took -- the Arrow Cross came in and took people out of our safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> through the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and they went.</sentence><sentence id="1742">So Raoul turned to our young boys and he said, "You have the Nazi uniforms." "</sentence><sentence id="1743">Yeah." "</sentence><sentence id="1744">Get dressed.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Get dressed." "</sentence><sentence id="1746">Where we going?"</sentence><sentence id="1747">He said, "You're going after them and bring them back."</sentence><sentence id="1748">Three or four boys went screaming at the German.</sentence><sentence id="1749">They all spoke German, and they said, "We have to take them to the <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span>." "</sentence><sentence id="1750">No, we have to take them.</sentence><sentence id="1751">You have phony papers."</sentence><sentence id="1752">And the Germans said, "No, I don't have." "</sentence><sentence id="1753">Yes, that's a phony papers."</sentence><sentence id="1754">Took it from him. "</sentence><sentence id="1755">Turn around.</sentence><sentence id="1756">We go."</sentence><sentence id="1757">So these poor people, they didn't know where they going and then finally, one of these little Hungarian came up to somebody and says, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="1758">We are the Wallenberg people."</sentence><sentence id="1759">And they took them all back.</sentence><sentence id="1760">Now we had phony papers.</sentence><sentence id="1761">We had real papers, too.</sentence><sentence id="1762">But you see this -- you have to do everything so 1S Edmund Veesenmayer</sentence><sentence id="1764">1 fast.</sentence><sentence id="1765">Now, it was not always easy.</sentence><sentence id="1766">His big, big heartbreak was when he had an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1767">He had two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> but in the one, we had 79 children.</sentence><sentence id="1768">And, of course, Raoul visits there bombing time and he picked up those crying kids and he would start making animal noises and telling them stories just to calm them down.</sentence><sentence id="1769">And the kids were talking, laughing and forgot that the bombs were falling like crazy because that was Raoul.</sentence><sentence id="1770">And he visited them as much as he could.</sentence><sentence id="1771">Not every day because he had to go out to the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span> and who knows where.</sentence><sentence id="1772">But he came to the children as much as he could, always with candies in his pockets and with just to make the kids happy.</sentence><sentence id="1773">He was a clown without the nose and everything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1774">And one day he arrived and found the children all dead.</sentence><sentence id="1775">We found out from the guard -- was a young boy, who was also shot, but thank God it went in his shoulder, so he could tell the story.</sentence><sentence id="1776">They came in.</sentence><sentence id="1777">Young, young, young, 13, 14 year old kids and started to just shoot the kids.</sentence><sentence id="1778">One little boy went under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> because his mother taught him before they parted and he thought his mother was dead and Raoul found the little boy walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and said to him, "Whenever you get in trouble, get under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1779">And these damn Hungarians were so busy shooting, they didn't even look under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1780">Just kill the kids.</sentence><sentence id="1781">And one more was saved, because she had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1782">So those two kids were saved.</sentence><sentence id="1783">The rest of it were all dead.</sentence><sentence id="1784">They just killed them for fun!And this was the only time I ever seen Raoul Wallenberg down on his knees crying, bitterly crying.</sentence><sentence id="1785">For about 10 minutes, he couldn't get to himself because killing children, that was more than he could take.</sentence><sentence id="1786">And then suddenly he got up, and he was again like seven foot tall, and said, "We're not going to stop fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1787">I want to save this <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1788">I want the children to make peace in this world."</sentence><sentence id="1789">And he went on fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1790">And it must have hurt him so badly.</sentence><sentence id="1791">And I do hope you will have a chance once to invite that wonderful young lady who has been saved because of scarlet fever.</sentence><sentence id="1792">Twice she was saved by Raoul, and she is now teaching in <span class="BUILDING">Mercer College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1793">She's teaching humanities and languages.</sentence><sentence id="1794">And you should have her.</sentence><sentence id="1795">I will give you the address after.</sentence><sentence id="1796">She's a marvelous person.</sentence><sentence id="1797">So in any case this was the two people.</sentence><sentence id="1798">And then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> was out again, when we heard that they shooting people into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube River</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1799">And it was December, just before Christmas.</sentence><sentence id="1800">And what the Hungarians did -- it was no snow -- it was a no stars, only heavy snowing and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>, the first time in 40 years was really frozen with huge icicles.</sentence><sentence id="1801">And they thought this is the best time to kill people because nobody will look for them and in the dark and they were cowards these, these Hungarian Nazi men.</sentence><sentence id="1802">But Eichmann said, "Do it."</sentence><sentence id="1803">So what they did, they roped three people together and then they shot the middle one and, of course, all three of them fell in and died.</sentence><sentence id="1804">Some of them, I understand, swam out somehow and survived.</sentence><sentence id="1805">But Raoul arrived <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the third day to hear about that from wherever he was, and he was beside himself. "</sentence><sentence id="1806">What will <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eichmann</span> do next?</sentence><sentence id="1807">How can they do that to human beings?"</sentence><sentence id="1808">And this was the first time he turned to us and asked, "How many of you can swim?"</sentence><sentence id="1809">I was the only one with three other diplomats, men, who put up my hand.</sentence><sentence id="1810">I said, "I was taught swimming in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1811">Let's go."</sentence><sentence id="1812">I had no idea where we're going.</sentence><sentence id="1813">So we went with our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1814">We</sentence><sentence id="1816">2 knew where they were shooting on the right, and on the left.</sentence><sentence id="1817">We turned off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1818">We had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span>, and every time we had to synchronize.</sentence><sentence id="1819">When they shot we had to fall in too, so that the splash goes at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="1820">Not that the Hungarians had time to listen because they were so busy.</sentence><sentence id="1821">They were afraid they would be caught.</sentence><sentence id="1822">So we -- when they fell we jumped and thanks to the icicles the rope hang on to the ice, and we knew where there is a rope, there is a body.</sentence><sentence id="1823">And we started to pull them out and then the nurses and the doctors were there, put them in, changed them.</sentence><sentence id="1824">Fifty people we saved -- what is nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1825">But it's more than if we had no <span class="BUILDING">Raoul Wallenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1826">We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we couldn't move anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1827">And then that was over and then we had one more big thing.</sentence><sentence id="1828">When they advertised -- the "lovely" Germans -- that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such and such a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> next morning to clean up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, we knew again that they will take them right out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1829">So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, "You all have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working in the <span class="REGION">Buda side</span> in a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> because as I told you we always had to move our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes.</sentence><sentence id="1830">And there was a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="1831">No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1832">But what was so amazing that it was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice, but moonlit.</sentence><sentence id="1833">Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows.</sentence><sentence id="1834">Why they didn't come on that night.</sentence><sentence id="1835">Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1836">We don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1837">The CIA!(r) must have been very good and the <span class="BUILDING">Scotland Yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1838">They didn't come.</sentence><sentence id="1839">And suddenly Raoul arrived around midnight.</sentence><sentence id="1840">Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said, "Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?"</sentence><sentence id="1841">And so we said, "Yeah."</sentence><sentence id="1842">And then he told us quickly a joke.</sentence><sentence id="1843">He said, "I don't want you to look up, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next <span class="BUILDING">villa</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1844">And naturally we all looked up.</sentence><sentence id="1845">He says, "Don't look up.</sentence><sentence id="1846">Just work.</sentence><sentence id="1847">It's only the <span class="BUILDING">German Headquarters</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1848">And he did like he didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="1849">If Raoul doesn't care if the German has <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, why should we, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1850">I mean it was crazy.</sentence><sentence id="1851">We were taken over by his strength.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And it was really a feeling, "If he can do it, then we should help him with everything."</sentence><sentence id="1853">So I was the lucky one who was first ready with about 500 of his papers and I -- he embarrass -- embraced me and he said, "Be careful."</sentence><sentence id="1854">And I said, "Yes Sir, I will."</sentence><sentence id="1855">And I left.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And I remember there was no one around.</sentence><sentence id="1857">I went with the curfew.</sentence><sentence id="1858">And I walked across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> because all my people were on the Pest side.</sentence><sentence id="1859">And it was a very emotional going because I had to ring some <span class="DLF">door</span> bells and some friends of mine came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they said, "Aggie, what you doing out?"</sentence><sentence id="1860">I said, "Please don't ask.</sentence><sentence id="1861">Don't ask.</sentence><sentence id="1862">16 <span class="BUILDING">Central Intelligence Agency</span></sentence><sentence id="1864">3 Just take this.</sentence><sentence id="1865">An angel sent it to you."</sentence><sentence id="1866">And we kissed and cried and I went on delivering all 500.</sentence><sentence id="1867">All I heard is my footstep on the snow.</sentence><sentence id="1868">But no bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Nobody.</sentence><sentence id="1870">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and finally I sit down on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and then it dawned to me what I just done.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And I said to myself, "Are you crazy?</sentence><sentence id="1872">You could have been killed."</sentence><sentence id="1873">Then like Raoul Wallenberg would say, "Get killed?</sentence><sentence id="1874">No way.</sentence><sentence id="1875">Because the Hungarians and the Germans, they're cowards.</sentence><sentence id="1876">They wouldn't be daring to be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a curfew."</sentence><sentence id="1877">And I went to sleep with nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1878">I woke up at six o'clock in the morning that my two girlfriends were thrown out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because of the pass.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And they ran all the way to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they -- actually they spoke more German than Hungarian because they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1880">But the German officer picked up their German and said something very ugly to them in German what they can do with the paper.</sentence><sentence id="1881">But the kids made one look at him and they turned around and started to run and he never shot after them.</sentence><sentence id="1882">He let them run.</sentence><sentence id="1883">So the paper had a big "something."</sentence><sentence id="1884">We don't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> did really.</sentence><sentence id="1885">If you read a few books now, you can put it together what really happened and what he did.</sentence><sentence id="1886">But it was amazing.</sentence><sentence id="1887">So my two girls friend are actually in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1888">They are grandmothers, both of them.</sentence><sentence id="1889">But they lived.</sentence><sentence id="1890">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1891">So it is incredible the things he has done.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And then that was already Christmastime.</sentence><sentence id="1893">I have never seen him again, because I got sick.</sentence><sentence id="1894">Maybe it was partly the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>, a little bit cold, but it was worthwhile.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And we only found out after that evidently I had a nervous breakdown.</sentence><sentence id="1896">But it didn't come out only in the afternoon when I got a bit excited.</sentence><sentence id="1897"><span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> a big fever and there were no doctors to get.</sentence><sentence id="1898">They were either hiding or being out on the front or they were
