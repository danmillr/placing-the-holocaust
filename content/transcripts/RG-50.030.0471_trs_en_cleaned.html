<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: Her father was an architect and actually did all sorts of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> both for the -- some private <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, but he did a lot of -- for instance, he was building <span class="DLF">docks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.343056" long="14.409167">Fiume</span> at the time, and various -- I think maybe some <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> of one kind or another.</sentence><sentence id="57">I don't think that he was a particularly inventive or artistic or whatever, but he was a work-a-day architect who always kept his profession, whereas the rest of his family was spending money like crazy and ended up paupers, many of them, after spending money like mad in one direction or another.</sentence><sentence id="58">He was always working.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="62">Q: And what was your father doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="64">A: My father was an industrialist.</sentence><sentence id="65">I think mostly agricultural.</sentence><sentence id="66"><span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> obviously was a very agricult -- mostly, 80 percent agricultural country, and he had alcohol -- and he had an <span class="BUILDING">alcohol yeast factory</span> which was a very large one, and probably the largest in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>, and a number of other <span class="BUILDING">agricultural refineries</span> and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: Since I'm ignorant, what does it mean to have an <span class="BUILDING">alcohol yeast factory</span>?</sentence><sentence id="71">What is that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="74">A: Well, yeast obviously, you know, is made - these we were almost monopolies because there were certain ones, I mean, not many people were producing yeast for making bread.</sentence><sentence id="75">Agricultural alcohol means that they would take beets, you know, various corn, for instance, and so on, and it would be refined as alcohol.</sentence><sentence id="76">And for a while, as a matter for fact, in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>, there was a law where you had to mix alcohol with gasoline, which is what they're doing here now, and this was always very protected because there were huge, huge taxes otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="77">But being as it was agricultural, any kind of agricultural stuff was protected by the government because it was sort of beneficial to the state or whatever, or the peasantry or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="78">So, obviously there were lots of <span class="REGION">land</span> where some of this raw material was produced, but also was bought from the peasants as needed.</sentence><sentence id="79">The yeast was, you know, shipped around and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="86">Q: So, you were born into a very privileged life?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: They were very social, but everybody was this way, young people, and it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">social town</span>, and it was a fairly small group, totally mixed -- both Jewish and non-Jewish population.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="103">Q: Now, were you taken care of primarily by governesses at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Yes, but my mother supervised.</sentence><sentence id="106">One of my very early memories was of a German nurse with a -- who were dressed like nuns, and had this long veil.</sentence><sentence id="107">They were special children's nurses.</sentence><sentence id="108">And she was unusually unpleasant, and put me apparently into a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I do remember that, and the cook saved -- me upstairs, started screaming and the woman was let go immediately, and then there was, I guess, when my brother was born, there was a peasant nanny that came and until my brother's maybe five, this was there.</sentence><sentence id="109">Then I got an English governess, Miss... her name was... because the second one -- the first one was called Miss "Mees Smees" -- Miss Smith -- she was known "Mees Smees", who was with us for maybe six months.</sentence><sentence id="110">My brother was throwing tantrums and -- because he couldn't stand her, and then the nanny came back for -- and stayed forever as part of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">And then there was a Swiss person who was quite unpleasant for about six months, and then my real English governess who stayed for years, whose name was Agnes Coyne.</sentence><sentence id="112">And there, there was something kind of amusing about her because when King Alexander was killed.</sentence><sentence id="113">There was a...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: That was in "28?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="125">A: No, I think maybe "34, "34.</sentence><sentence id="126">There was a regency formed because Peter was too young to govern and one of the -- I mean, the main member of this, of this regency was King Alexander's cousin, Prince Paul, and two other persons -- one was a Slovene and the other was a guy buy name of Ivo Perovic, which was a Croatian ban, which was sort of like a governor of a state.</sentence><sentence id="127">He had three children and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, but then they moved back to -- then they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span>, and they decided they absolutely had to have our governess, and contacted her and contacted my mother, and they wanted -- she didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="128">And my mother said, "You absolutely have to go because we would have sanctions against us left and right.</sentence><sentence id="129">You can't say no."</sentence><sentence id="130">And finally she went, but apparently she was so unhappy she phoned us practically every week, and one day appeared at our <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> with her suitcases and my mother had to make up some big story about her being sick, having to move to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, nervous breakdown and so on, and she stayed until I guess I was 16.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: So, do you remember conversations around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>?</sentence><sentence id="146">Were they very inquisitive about what you had done during the day?</sentence><sentence id="147">Or was this a very adult meal?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: Both.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Both?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="158">A: Both, but yes, of course, because we often didn't have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="159"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> were -- school days were three days in the morning, three days in the afternoon from eight to one, quarter to one, something like that, and then afterwards we would have private classes of one kind or another at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in German, French, this and that.</sentence><sentence id="160">And, my brother may have gone -- he did not go to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I did, but I'm a little -- I'm already <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">I'll go back, if you want, to, to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Well, you know, you sit around and slop around in sort of a <span class="INT_SPACE">children's room</span>, it's different than when you're sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a meal that was served with white gloves.</sentence></p></dialogue>
