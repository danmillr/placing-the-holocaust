<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: And where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at the time and the name of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berehovo</span>, on April 29, 1930.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Tell me about your family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, my family were a very close and loving family.</sentence><sentence id="14">My father conducted his business from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and therefore I saw him quite a bit during the day.</sentence><sentence id="15">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the mornings and in the afternoon I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...uh...spent time with my father as well as my mother who was a homemaker and she just took care of us.</sentence><sentence id="16">That was her sole job.</sentence><sentence id="17">And I had a brother who was 6 years older than I. And we lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">Uh...I would call ourselves...uh...like middle income family.</sentence><sentence id="19">I had all the comforts, and all my needs were covered.</sentence><sentence id="20">We used to go away in the summertime into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> for vacations...uh...during the Christmas school holiday or the....uh...holiday during Easter with...I visited some family in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, about 50, 60 miles away from where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="21">And my...my cousins would come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we would just exchange...uh...these visits and we were a very very tight knit family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Tell me about you and <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> obviously in the mornings up until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="34">And...uh...in the afternoons during the summer, I would go with my friends swimming.</sentence><sentence id="35">We played ball.</sentence><sentence id="36">Uh...My friends who lived in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, they...uh...used to go to each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">I also went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, which was right after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">And Saturday mornings we had...uh...religion but more the...instead of studying just history, we were...uh...learning how to read Hebrew and in the early stages that was okay, but then later on when the anti-Semitism became worse, they were not...the Hungarian government was not very cooperative and didn't want to...us to learn...uh...or get education in the Hebrew language or the Hebrew history, and that was little by little eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="39">Uh...I'd say about 1938...39,...uh...the anti-Semitism just became worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="40">We heard...my father was a avid reader of the newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="41">He read every paper that was available.</sentence><sentence id="42">We had a radio that...but no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> at the time obviously.</sentence><sentence id="43">And my father and my mother were listening to the news all the time to know what was going on in the world.</sentence><sentence id="44">And we had heard things happening, but nothing of what was to come.</sentence><sentence id="45">There were even some rumors that some people escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> over to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and they were telling about some horror stories what were...what was being done to Jews there.</sentence><sentence id="46">But nobody would believe it.</sentence><sentence id="47">They thought it...somebody lost their minds to come up with horror stories such as this.</sentence><sentence id="48">So they never...they totally disregarded this.</sentence><sentence id="49">But I remember all these conversations only my parents talking.</sentence><sentence id="50">That was in 1930.</sentence><sentence id="51">I was only a 8 year old child, and I was still just playing with my friends and I just heard these things.</sentence><sentence id="52">And thinking back, these little bits and pieces of...uh...this information are coming back to me.</sentence><sentence id="53">As a matter of a fact, my mother had a sister...that was her youngest sibling, who met a young man...I would say probably the early part of 1938, who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> about maybe 20 miles away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>...or our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and he and his family...uh...emmigrated.</sentence><sentence id="54">They came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">And when he was a young man around early part of 1938 he came back to visit his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and traveled around and visited different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">And he met my aunt who was a very beautiful, maybe 20, 21 year old young woman.</sentence><sentence id="57">I mean very, very beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="58">And they really fell in love and decided to get married and that she would come back with her...with him to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">But that time already again the government interfered in all kinds of things...everythings happens throughout the world.</sentence><sentence id="60">And they were having a hard time trying to get the papers for her to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">So he had to be back a certain time.</sentence><sentence id="62">That was because his visa expired, and he had to come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and her papers were not approved yet at that time so that she couldn't come back with him.</sentence><sentence id="63">So they said that she should stay there and they will try to make all the arrangements for her papers to be cleared so that she can join him.</sentence><sentence id="64">But this went on for months and months and months and writing to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to the government and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> which was again part of the time it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, part of the time it was again <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">In November 9th of 1938, the Hungarians took back this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">So we were dealing again with two governments.</sentence><sentence id="67">So they had a awful lot of problems, and they just could not accomplish...uh...what they set out to do to clear her so that she could join him.</sentence><sentence id="68">So he came back.</sentence><sentence id="69">When he saw that the war was imminent...you know it was just about any time now.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="70">So he decided to come...to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and he was there maybe 48 hours and he took care of all the papers and visa and everything and then they let her go with him.</sentence><sentence id="71">And they came out with the very last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> just before the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="72">And they settled in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> where they raised a child and lived a very beautiful life all these years until, of course, she heard what happened to the rest of her family in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="73">After she came out and...uh...things were getting worse in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">And more and more anti- Semitism was going on.</sentence><sentence id="75">People were...uh...being arrested, falsely accused of all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="76">Uh...Students couldn't not go into higher education because that became what they called the Numerus Klausus and only a certain number of students were allowed in higher education.</sentence><sentence id="77">And the...only way that my brother and I were able to get into this Klausus because our grades were excellent.</sentence><sentence id="78">And my parents put an awful lot of emphasis on us getting a good education and studying and learning and they were always supervising that we should get the best of everything.</sentence><sentence id="79">And education was one of the most important things in the world.</sentence><sentence id="80">But as time went on, it was getting more and more difficult in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="81">The teachers were quite anti-Semitic and they made learning very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="82">And if we deserved a grade A in a subject, we would get maybe a C, just barely passing so that we were not treated like the other students.</sentence><sentence id="83">And neither were grown-ups, adults in <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">Uh...Doctors and attorneys and professional people were...were already not allowed to practice their profession because they were no longer trusted.</sentence><sentence id="85">You know, the Aryan race was something super special so Jewish doctors could no longer take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="86">And then <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were little by little taken...uh...away.</sentence><sentence id="87">They...the government and...uh...would put somebody else, an Aryan, into a business to sort of run it.</sentence><sentence id="88">It was still so-called Jewish owned, but a Hungarian was already in charge and little by little it was worked so that the Aryan or the Hungarian who was the one that was going to be the beneficiary, so little by little this is what was done.</sentence><sentence id="89">Then in March of 1944...uh...Hitler and Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">And I can remember clear as a bell as if | would hear it right now.</sentence><sentence id="91">We had guests over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when the news came over the radio, which by the way we could only listen to at that point under...uh...coverings you know.</sentence><sentence id="92">The draperies had to be drawn completely because we were not allowed to listen to the...uh...the news from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or from different parts of the world.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="93">That was already against the law.</sentence><sentence id="94">But somehow, you know, somebody was always watching out, looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> if any...there was any Hungarian...uh...official or the gendarmes or the...uh...police anywhere nearby so that other people in the family or in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> could listen to the radio and could listen to the news and what was happening everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="95">So when my parents heard on the radio that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, my mother's words were quote "this is the end of us" unquote.</sentence><sentence id="96">And I can...I was only 13 years old, but I still remember those words.</sentence><sentence id="97">And little did we know at that time how true...how close to the truth it came.</sentence><sentence id="98">We didn't know what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="99">We didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="100">It's just the...the fear.</sentence><sentence id="101">It is just what we have heard, what we have read...what my parents have read.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="102">As I said, I was just a child and I wasn't really aware of everything that was happening.</sentence><sentence id="103">But this is what they were afraid of.</sentence><sentence id="104">And sure enough within a matter of a couple of weeks, there were many decrees issued, and one of the first ones was to wear the yellow star on the outer garment in the front as well as in the back.</sentence><sentence id="105">That if we were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> we would be recognized as Jews and, therefore, secondary citizens.</sentence><sentence id="106">They could keep an eye on us so we...so that we could not...we could not go on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> after dark or before dawn.</sentence><sentence id="107">We could be only when we could be vis...visible during the day, and there were many other decrees of course.</sentence><sentence id="108">This is when they really strictly enforced...uh...all the...uh...other decrees that I was talking about.</sentence><sentence id="109">It was semi-official until now.</sentence><sentence id="110">As doctors not being able to practice, they were no longer allowed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="111">And <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> now were being taken, actually taken away, not just having somebody in there that would run it you know.</sentence><sentence id="112">And...uh...little by little, it became just worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="113">Within weeks, it was...it was matter of weeks.</sentence><sentence id="114">We were in April...it was the beginning of April...I think we were invaded around the end of March, and in April already we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">And what was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence><sentence id="116">Now what happened here was the German SS, in cooperation...with total cooperation of the Hungarian police and the Hungarian gendarmes, came to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> very early in the morning at dawn and knocking real hard and "Jews, Get out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">Get out and line up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>."</sentence><sentence id="118">We couldn't imagine what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="119">I mean it was just a horrible, horrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="120">The children were screaming, and all of us were...were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="121">We didn't know what was happening and what was to come.</sentence><sentence id="122">And then we were told that we will be allowed back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for just a few minutes to get a little suitcase or a little handbag in which we could put a change of clothing and maybe some food, just dry food like a piece of bread or something that we had and then we were to come out again and line up in front of the...our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">So we each got a little bag and put just the bare minimum in there.</sentence><sentence id="124">And then we were being marched down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where there was the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">There were several little <span class="REGION">areas</span> that were designated as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> where the Jews were congregated.</sentence><sentence id="126">Now where we were it was just down the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the...uh...<span class="DLF">back yard</span> of our neighbor where they were making...uh...barrels, the kind that they store wines in right now, and they were also making...in some of the bigger <span class="REGION">areas</span> and different areas in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...they were making brick.</sentence><sentence id="127">And so instead of us being ushered into <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where we will be staying, these were like just a <span class="DLF">carport</span>...just a covering to protect us somewhat from the rain and the sunshine, the strong sun.</sentence><sentence id="128">But there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="130">It just...if we took a blanket with us or a change of clothing, that's all we had.</sentence><sentence id="131">So we were herded into this <span class="REGION">area</span> and surrounded by...uh...<span class="DLF">fences</span> so that we could not go anywhere of course.</sentence><sentence id="132">And the Hungarian soldiers and gendarmes were surrounding us so that there was no way of getting out of there.</sentence><sentence id="133">And then we were getting...when we got into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and...uh...we were to put down our belongings under this <span class="REGION">area</span> where...under the coverings of these...like carports and the Germans and the police and the Hungarian gendarmes erected a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and they stood up in front of us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="134">They...uh...we had to come out from underneath and line up in front of these...uh...carports or <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were standing.</sentence><sentence id="135">And they erected this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and they stood up there and they said to us the following.</sentence><sentence id="136">We will place barrels and buckets all along on front of you.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="137">And you are to place all your money...all your valuables in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barrels</span> and buckets.</sentence><sentence id="138">Now don't get any idea on not putting them in there because we are going to search you afterwards and if we find as much as a penny on you, you will be lined up against a <span class="DLF">wall</span>...and they showed us a <span class="DLF">wall</span> right near by...and you'll be shot.</sentence><sentence id="139">But this was the day of my 14th birthday.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="140">So it was the worst, but in the end one of the best days of my life because my parents placed everything...what they thought was everything...all the belongings in these buckets and barrels because there were the Germans and the SS and the gendarmes and police with guns all over them...belts with revolvers all around them and each one had at least one gun on their shoulders.</sentence><sentence id="141">They were very, very threatening.</sentence><sentence id="142">And we were very law abiding, peaceful citizens.</sentence><sentence id="143">We didn't have any guns.</sentence><sentence id="144">We had nothing to protect ourselves with.</sentence><sentence id="145">So when we were herded out of our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, all we had with us that little change of clothing and nothing else.</sentence><sentence id="146">So we had no way of protecting us and we had no way...it just made no...no sense to really protect although we tried, and those that did were beaten up something terrible.</sentence><sentence id="147">But we had no way of protecting against all these guns and against these SS and against these soldiers...you know the police and the gendarmes.</sentence><sentence id="148">So they did and we did as we were told.</sentence><sentence id="149">So everybody took off their jewelry and money...whatever money was in the pockets and everybody placed them in the buckets and the barrels.</sentence><sentence id="150">However, there were people who were wearing a watch perhaps since they were a child or a wedding band for 10, 20, or 30 years.</sentence><sentence id="151">And they were so used to these that they didn't even realize anymore that they had it on.</sentence><sentence id="152">And they might have forgotten to put it in.</sentence><sentence id="153">And these people were taken and lined up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to be shot later.</sentence><sentence id="154">Among them were...was my father.</sentence><sentence id="155">When he was searched after placing all these things into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barrels</span> and buckets, they found a small amount...like a dollar bill in one of his little vest pockets and because of that, he was lined up against the war to be shot too.</sentence><sentence id="156">Now, this is my 14th birthday.</sentence><sentence id="157">And my father was to be shot in front of my eyes momentarily.</sentence><sentence id="158">It was a horrible time.</sentence><sentence id="159">But apparently they were...the SS and the gendarmes and the police were not given orders yet to kill.</sentence><sentence id="160">Apparently, they were just given orders to use the worst scare technics on us so that we would follow orders exactly as they wished...as they wanted us to do.</sentence><sentence id="161">So after several hours until they collected all these loots, all these goodies they released all these people that were lined up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="162">Well, as I said, it was also one of the happiest moments of my life because my father wasn't to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="163">And that was in the end my happy 14th birthday.</sentence><sentence id="164">He was freed.</sentence><sentence id="165">We were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>...in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about 2 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="166">We could not leave because we were surrounded by the Hungarian gendarmes and the police who were very, very happy to cooperate with the Germans because they were all promised rewards for their...for the job that they were doing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="167">So they were at times even more cruel than the Germans just to prove that they...they really meant what they were saying, that they were going to cooperate.</sentence><sentence id="168">They were beating us even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where it wasn't really necessary but they felt that they are going to be rewarded so they were beating us 10 times worse than the Germans at that time.</sentence><sentence id="169">About 2 weeks after we were in this camp, we were again lined up and marched to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">And at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> there was a very, very long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting for us ready to go.</sentence><sentence id="171">Now these were not regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> in which normally people travel.</sentence><sentence id="172">These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, you know, in which normally animals are being transported.</sentence><sentence id="173">Each had about 2 little <span class="DLF">windows</span> on either side in which the fresh air would come in.</sentence><sentence id="174">Normally when animals are being transported in such manner, they just put them in sparsely so they're comfortable for whatever journey they are taking.</sentence><sentence id="175">But when we were placed into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span>, we were packed in like herrings or sardines in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">can</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move.</sentence><sentence id="177">We were practically on top of one another.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="178">And we were given two buckets after we were packed in.</sentence><sentence id="179">One was a bucket of water, and the other was a empty bucket for personal elimination for the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> full of people.</sentence><sentence id="180">We were so tightly packed that if a person wanted to reach over to somebody else, that person had to climb over several other people in between...let's say a father and mother were sitting here with their children, but a child wants to reach another child a little further down, a friend perhaps, that child had to climb over adults to reach that person because there was just no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to move.</sentence><sentence id="181">We were traveling in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for about 3 days and 3 nights with just a drop of water that we were all each able to get because there were probably about a hundred people so one bucket of water, all you could get was just a few drops.</sentence><sentence id="182">During the day it was very, very hot because we were so crowded in and just the little bitty <span class="DLF">windows</span> that we got some fresh air in.</sentence><sentence id="183">And at night it was very cold because we were traveling through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">high mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">Of course, we didn't know where we were going, and we were just freezing.</sentence><sentence id="185">So nighttime freezing, daytime horribly, horribly hot.</sentence><sentence id="186">And no food and just a little drop of water which went the very first day.</sentence><sentence id="187">And we were traveling and traveling and we had no idea where we were.</sentence><sentence id="188">We were trying to look through those little <span class="DLF">windows</span> to see if we recognized where we were, but nobody knew where we were or where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="189">So after about 3 days and 3 nights of traveling, we stopped.</sentence><sentence id="190">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had stopped.</sentence><sentence id="191">It was night time.</sentence><sentence id="192">Couldn't see anything except flames in the distance.</sentence><sentence id="193">The odor that was coming in through those little <span class="DLF">windows</span> into those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> were horrible.</sentence><sentence id="194">We didn't know what that was.</sentence><sentence id="195">It was burning...like burning flesh, but who would...whose mind would enter something like this.</sentence><sentence id="196">It was a horrible odor, and just flames in the distance and howling of the dogs.</sentence><sentence id="197">We didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="198">And we just had to wait and wait.</sentence><sentence id="199">And we heard voices in German and we had no idea what it was.</sentence><sentence id="200">Where we were or what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="201">So after it started to get a little light <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, we began to see movement and we saw SS soldiers with their insignia on their sleeves and their hats and guns on their shoulders, on the waist and with the big, big police dogs that they were walking up and down and speaking to one other and shouting to one another in German.</sentence><sentence id="202">We still had no idea where we were or what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="203">All we could finally see as it was getting light...wires, <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> about 10, 12 feet high with wires going across...like electric wires going right through them.</sentence><sentence id="204">And we still didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="205">We didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="206">Finally, the SS brought over a whole bunch of men in grey and blue striped uniforms and they brought along with them like a flat top <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>...2 wheels with a flat top <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and two handles.</sentence><sentence id="207">And they were all lined up <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and all the SS with all these dogs and all these men in the uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="208">Finally, the SS started to open up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and we were told to get off and just line up right next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">As we were getting off, these men in the uniform...uh...told us to line up in fives and told us exactly where.</sentence><sentence id="210">Just right along side the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">And then after we all came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and was standing there, then the job of these men were to climb upon these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and remove what we found out later were bodies of people who died along the way.</sentence><sentence id="212">They were older people who couldn't handle this horrible cold and heat and no food and no water.</sentence><sentence id="213">They were sick people.</sentence><sentence id="214">Could have had a heart condition or whatever and died along the way.</sentence><sentence id="215">There were infants who had no water and the cold and the heat...they just couldn't last.</sentence><sentence id="216">So there were countless people who died along the way and they were taken off now by these men who were inmates.</sentence><sentence id="217">Now these people have been in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> already 6 months to 3 years or prior to that because what we found out much later these were inmates that were taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>...Jews...political prisoners who did not agree with the German's philosophy, and these people were there and they were doing this labor.</sentence><sentence id="218">This was was the...their job to take the people who died along the way and they put all these dead people on this <span class="DLF">platform</span>, two- wheeled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, and then they were taking them off and straight to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> where, within minutes, they were burned.</sentence><sentence id="219">Of course, we didn't know any of these things.</sentence><sentence id="220">We just saw them take off these dead people, and we were still to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> there because the police...I mean the SS at this point already was there with their police dogs and we were standing there because anybody dared to move, they just released the dog who teared people apart.</sentence><sentence id="221">So first the took away the people who were dead.</sentence><sentence id="222">Then there were other men who came and separated the men from the women.</sentence><sentence id="223">And we still had no idea where we were.</sentence><sentence id="224">But some of these people...these inmates were whispering to some of the people who had just arrived.</sentence><sentence id="225">We...we asked...not me as a child, but my parents or their friends asked, "Where are we?</sentence><sentence id="226">Where are we?</sentence><sentence id="227">What is this <span class="NPIP">place</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="228">And he says...they said, "Don't you know?</sentence><sentence id="229">You are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>."</sentence><sentence id="230">And we didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> meant or what it was.</sentence><sentence id="231">And they kept asking, "Where are we?</sentence><sentence id="232">What is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="233">And he says...and they kept saying, "This is the place where all your parents and your grandparents and your babies were killed and will be killed.</sentence><sentence id="234">This is the largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and you may not survive this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp."</span></sentence><sentence id="235">And we were told at the time, you know, to just line up and relax because you're going to be taken to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and your will be given clean clothes and you'll be working in a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">So just keep calm because they tried to avoid any reaction, any commotion.</sentence><sentence id="237">They wanted to keep us as calm as possible.</sentence><sentence id="238">And these men kept saying under their...while they were gathering up these dead..""You may never make it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">Everybody that comes here is dead in a short time."</sentence><sentence id="240">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="241">So first we were separated.</sentence><sentence id="242">My father with my brother and my mother and I and all the men on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and all the women on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">And they were...the men were going in one direction and then the women were going...marched in another direction.</sentence><sentence id="244">And as we were marching we came to...uh...fork in the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">And at this fork in the <span class="DLF">road</span> was a very well dressed handsome officer with a small stick like a conductor's baton in his hand.</sentence><sentence id="246">And he would motion to the left or to the right which direction a person was to go.</sentence><sentence id="247">Again not knowing where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="248">What was the direction for...for all we know is that older people and little children were directed to go in one direction and the younger, healthier looking people were going in the opposite direction.</sentence><sentence id="249">Still not knowing where we are going or anything.</sentence><sentence id="250">But my mother was a very, very intelligent woman.</sentence><sentence id="251">Spoke several languages.</sentence><sentence id="252">And when she saw this well dressed officer who had a couple of...uh...assistants near him...and when she saw that this officer was directing the older people to go in one direction and the younger people in the other direction, she must have had some kind of a intuition because she told me, "Mady.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="253">Straighten yourself up.</sentence><sentence id="254">Straighten up your body."</sentence><sentence id="255">And she pinched my cheeks that I should look very healthy because after this trip of 3 days and 3 nights in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> without food or water, we all looked horrible.</sentence><sentence id="256">And she said, "Straighten up.</sentence><sentence id="257">I want you to look older than you are."</sentence><sentence id="258">And when it was our turn to face this officer, she said in German, "I'm 43 and she's 14."</sentence><sentence id="259">And because apparently he was impressed with my mother's appearance and her conduct and her command of the German language, he motioned us to the direction where the healthy, younger people were going.</sentence><sentence id="260">Later, we found out who this elegant officer was who decided who is going to live and who is going to die.</sentence><sentence id="261">And his name was Doctor Josef Mengele, and he also selected not just these younger, healthier looking people to go to work for them or do whatever they felt that we could do for them, he also selected at this point as they were...as the people were marching in front of him...twins, and possibly dwarfs or people who were very tiny or anything that was unusual looking because he wanted later to conduct various experiments.</sentence><sentence id="262">We were marched in one direction heading toward some <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were told that we're going to get...take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and we're gonna be given clean clothes and then we'll be taken to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we will work.</sentence><sentence id="263">The same thing was told to these older people and the children...that we are going to take you to this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where you're going to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and get fresh clothes and you will be well taken care of.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="264">They didn't mention labor or work, but you will be well taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="265">So this to keep everybody as calm as possible.</sentence><sentence id="266">But when these people, the older women and mothers with their babes in their arms or holding the hand of the little child were taken into this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and yes, there were shower heads about every few feet and everybody was to get undressed completely to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and when they did, they were to leave their clothes in an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, dropping everything and they were told that they'll get their clothes later and not to worry.</sentence><sentence id="267">They'll just be disinfected and cleaned, and they'll get it...they'll get it later, but first we'll get...they'll get some fresh clean clothes after the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">But instead of getting water from these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faucets</span>...from these spickets in the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>, they got gas.</sentence><sentence id="269">And within minutes they all fell dead to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">They were after awhile...they were crawling on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> trying...they were found near the <span class="DLF">doors</span> or near the <span class="DLF">walls</span> trying to reach for some <span class="DLF">air</span> for...as they were found later.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Did you see any of this?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: I did not see them because they were in one <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">They were in one <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and we were in another.</sentence><sentence id="274">We have seen...we have been told, and we have seen movies later on that the Germans themselves took movies of these people as how they were trying to escape and told by these inmates that...whose job again was after they were gassed and they fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and died...it was their job again to go back into these <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and gather up these bodies and again put them on these flat boards and take them straight to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">So they were telling us later again what they have seen.</sentence><sentence id="276">And this is how they had to get people from the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and near the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, trying to get a breath of...last breath of fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="277">And that's how they all died.</sentence><sentence id="278">They were put on these flat top <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and straight to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="286">Q: Let's come back to you.</sentence><sentence id="287">I would like to focus on what happened to you.</sentence><sentence id="288">You...When you and your mother went to the right.</sentence><sentence id="289">Tell us where you went.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: I was going to come to that right now.</sentence><sentence id="295">We also were marched now toward this other <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that looked just like the one where the older people and the younger children went.</sentence><sentence id="296">We too went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which is <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and we were told to take our clothes off and put all the clothes down there and we were going to go into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we were to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and then get fresh clothes.</sentence><sentence id="297">And yes we were going into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we, in fact, did take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="298">We did get water and we take...took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">And from there, we went into another big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> right adjacent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> where there was German soldiers with little scissors or these little hand machines that they normally they would trim the back of the hair when you go to...uh...get a haircut.</sentence><sentence id="300">And with that...with those scissors, or with those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>, they cut off or they shaved our heads, under the arms and the pubic area.</sentence><sentence id="301">And mind you these were all men doing this on women to just further dehumanize us.</sentence><sentence id="302">I mean women tried to be modest, tried to cover up, but there was nothing to cover up with.</sentence><sentence id="303">We were stark naked standing there.</sentence><sentence id="304">And we went through this dehumanizing...uh...process of being shaven by all these men after which we were all given a clean dress.</sentence><sentence id="305">It was a grey...like a men's shirt, a grey shirt, but very long.</sentence><sentence id="306">So whether you were 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighing maybe 90 pounds or you were...uh...5 feet 10 inches tall and being...weighing 180 pounds, we all got the same dress.</sentence><sentence id="307">So those that were short, the dress was down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">Those that they were heavier and taller, they might have reached above the knees.</sentence><sentence id="309">And we had at this point no hair.</sentence><sentence id="310">And when...if a mother and daughter or two sisters stood next to one another, they didn't recognize each other.</sentence><sentence id="311">They had to call for each one by name.</sentence><sentence id="312">Mother didn't mean anything because there was other mothers.</sentence><sentence id="313">They would say Mother Helen or Mother Elizabeth or Sister...uh...Suzanne or whoever...because you did not recognize each other.</sentence><sentence id="314">We looked so horrible without hair and with just this dress that some short, some long.</sentence><sentence id="315">And it was just an awful, awful experience.</sentence><sentence id="316">But that too we survived.</sentence><sentence id="317">From here again we were lined up in rows of fives and we were marched to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">And when we were marched into these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> like...let's say the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looked like an <span class="BUILDING">army barrack</span>, but inside there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">What they had was <span class="DLF">platforms</span> made out of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="320">Like three tiers, approximately 6 feet wide and about 6 feet deep before it was partitioned.</sentence><sentence id="321">And between each row of the three rows, there were maybe about 2 and a half feet of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">And we were to climb into these <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> and lie down there and there were...we were again packed in side by side so...so tightly that if a person was uncomfortable and very...tried to move or turn over, everybody in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> had to turn over with him because there was just no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> any other way.</sentence><sentence id="323">So this is where we stayed.</sentence><sentence id="324">This is where we slept.</sentence><sentence id="325">And next morning it was still pitch dark...I'd say probably about 4 o'clock in the morning, we were lined up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, again with the SS, with the police dogs with the guns everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="326">And they were...we were to be counted.</sentence><sentence id="327">So we were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> 3 or 4 hours a day until the SS that was in charge of the day to count us came by and counted the row.</sentence><sentence id="328">Only thing that I forgot to mention was that when we were marching from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> toward...to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, we were so dehydrated and hungry and thirsty that whenever we saw a little water whether it was a <span class="DLF">fountain</span> or a puddle...whatever, we were just so dehydrated we try to grab a drink and everybody was running for some water whether it was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">wash basin</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="329">Little did we know that we should have never touched that water because that was highly contaminated in the following way.</sentence><sentence id="330"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in 1944, when we got there, was already a very efficient killing machinery.</sentence><sentence id="331">They already had the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">gas ovens</span> going 24 hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="332">That was very, very easy.</sentence><sentence id="333">It was like a speedy mechanized way of killing people.</sentence><sentence id="334">But years prior when they first opened it, they didn't have all of this, so the way they killed the people that they brought there was that they had to dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> maybe 10 foot deep and after they dug these <span class="DLF">ditches</span>, there were lined up against the edge of the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and they were shot in the back, killing them and these people fell into these <span class="DLF">ditches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">And then those few people that they kept that were in charge again like these men that were in charge of taking the people to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>, they were also charged in covering up these...uh...these 10 feet ditches with all these people in there with just some dirt.</sentence><sentence id="336">But through the years, the bodies were eroding.</sentence><sentence id="337">They were deteriorating, and as the fluids from the bodies went into seep into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and washed down by the underground water, it went into the water system.</sentence><sentence id="338">So the water that we drank to try to quench our horrible thirst was in fact poison because we were poisoned by this water...this sewer water that was the bodies gave out and went into the water system.</sentence><sentence id="339">So when we were in the...in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and then when we consequently had to stand 3, 4 hours in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> morning and evening to be counted, we got very, very sick.</sentence><sentence id="340">We were very weak, especially the little people like myself.</sentence><sentence id="341">I was, you know, very, very frail and very small and I had just turned 14.</sentence><sentence id="342">And I got very, very sick.</sentence><sentence id="343">And so were many others.</sentence><sentence id="344">So those people who were...did not get quite sick or didn't have to take part in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, they were standing erect all this time and those of us that were so horribly sick that we couldn't even stand up, we were sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> until the Germans got close enough that we would have to stand only for a minute or two and then we...they helped us stand up and supporting us more or less from the back or from the side so that we could stand up long enough for that minute or two.</sentence><sentence id="345">Because when they came to count us, they were also looking us over because if anybody looked sick or older than what they thought or weak, they would just take him right out and off they went to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="346">So these so called selections were actually taking place continuously.</sentence><sentence id="347">So while we were standing there and then they went on and on, then we finally after 3 or 4 hours after we were counted, we could go back into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and lie down on this...on this...uh... <span class="DLF">platforms</span> or <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> and that's where we were 0 staying.</sentence><sentence id="348">Now, fortunately our group only stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for about a week.</sentence><sentence id="349">We were needed in an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> in the Polish-German area near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">Of course, again, we didn't know anything about this.</sentence><sentence id="351">We were just loaded up one morning, you know, when it was just first getting... getting...beginning to get light into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> covered with canvas.</sentence><sentence id="352">And we were traveling for a few hours.</sentence><sentence id="353">We didn't know where to.</sentence><sentence id="354">And they didn't want us to see where we are going or what was in the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="355">So we were taken for hours in this...these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then we arrived to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">Again, we didn't know where we were.</sentence><sentence id="357">But we just saw lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> surrounding us, and again unloading us and then we saw <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="358">And we were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were herded again in front of them and being counted and counted and counted again.</sentence><sentence id="359">And we found out that we are in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> where there were already about 5, 6 hundred women...uh...from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="360">These were Jewish women who were taken years before and they had been working in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> already for some period of time and they were also taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and from other...uh... exterminating and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and they were needed here so they brought them here.</sentence><sentence id="361">And then we were joined...we joined them.</sentence><sentence id="362">And we found out that we are going to work in a <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">So we were woken up again, like about 5 o'clock every morning and lined up and counted again and then we would be given a piece of moldy, dark bread and what they called coffee was like...more like a luke warm brown water.</sentence><sentence id="364">And that was to last for the day.</sentence><sentence id="365">And some people were...couldn't even last to try to take a piece of it during...in the morning ____ and then save some for later and then others...well, some people just ate the whole thing right then and there because they were so hungry they could...they just couldn't last.</sentence><sentence id="366">And then others were portioning themselves to have a couple of bites 2 hours from now and another couple of bites a little bit later.</sentence><sentence id="367">But anyway this was our meal for the day that we were to work on first marching about an hour to this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and another hour back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where we were staying.</sentence><sentence id="368">And we were working in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and you have to understand what we were...what we had to do in order to survive because whoever resisted was killed on the spot so there was no if...it was a choice.</sentence><sentence id="369">Either to live or to die!</sentence><sentence id="370">If you did what you were told, then temporarily you knew that you are alive.</sentence><sentence id="371">You don't know what happen...what happened the next day.</sentence><sentence id="372">There was the SS surrounding us and the...the big police dogs were with them all the time and all the guns.</sentence><sentence id="373">So if you didn't do exactly as you were told, the beatings were coming continuously.</sentence><sentence id="374">We were working on parts...different parts in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that went into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>...into bomb setting...time setting for the bombs, all kinds of ammunition that where they needed these little parts.</sentence><sentence id="375">We didn't know each one was working on something else.</sentence><sentence id="376">And this is what we had to make.</sentence><sentence id="377">With these guns...with these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>...with these bombs that we were making and creating, they killed the Allies.</sentence><sentence id="378">They were killing...they were taking it into the war mechanism.</sentence><sentence id="379">They were killing the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="380">They were killing the English and the Russians and the inmates in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="381">That's what this was used for.</sentence><sentence id="382">And we had to make that.</sentence><sentence id="383">We had to make...help manufacture that if we wanted to survive.</sentence><sentence id="384">And human nature is very funny.</sentence><sentence id="385">We all want to live.</sentence><sentence id="386">The oldest and the sickest person in this world wants to go on living.</sentence><sentence id="387">That is human nature.</sentence><sentence id="388">Good or

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="524">Q: Well, we're back to Sundays being very special because we did not have to go to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">What we did was, again, of course, being counted in the morning and given the warm coffee and a piece of bread for the day.</sentence><sentence id="526">And then we were to scrub the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where were we staying and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> spotless.</sentence><sentence id="527">And that was being inspected after we thought we cleaned it.</sentence><sentence id="528">And if the SS was not satisfied, then we got the beatings of our life time and start all over again.</sentence><sentence id="529">And we did this most of the day...a good part of the day just cleaning and scrubbing and spotless again, inspection, and back to square one.</sentence><sentence id="530">And then toward the end of the day we were given the specialty of the day.</sentence><sentence id="531">We would have a special meal.</sentence><sentence id="532">It wasn't just the hot water they called soup with the green leaves floating in it for the...the meal for the end of the day.</sentence><sentence id="533">We were given a soup that had potatoes in it and I hope you don't get sick if I tell you what else was in there which we felt was the delicacy of the day.</sentence><sentence id="534">That was horse meat.</sentence><sentence id="535">And if...as we were dealt this soup and if in the ladle a little piece of that horse meat got caught among those couple of potatoes and the green leaves, it was like the delicacy that we called like a piece of caviar that we had.</sentence><sentence id="536">And it...this is what we were looking forward to all week.</sentence><sentence id="537">This is the main meal.</sentence><sentence id="538">This was once a week that we had a little bit more than just the plain brown water with a little moldy piece of bread and the hot water with green leaves, you know, at the end of the day.</sentence><sentence id="539">And this is how we were for almost a year.</sentence><sentence id="540">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.711894" long="16.581747">Peterswaldau</span>" and the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> if I can still remember is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diehl</span>, I think, D-I-E-H-L.

ever been capable of, we were all emoting all of that.</sentence><sentence id="630">And it was just unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="631">It...it was just the most remarkable occasion or day of...of anybody's existence.</sentence><sentence id="632">And we burst open the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and we just ran out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we just ran on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="633">But we went first...we broke into what they called the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where they kept their...whatever food there was left because we were so hungry...all of us.</sentence><sentence id="634">I mean living under...a little meager piece of bread and the so-called soup, that we broke into this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and...where...all we could find at this point...I mean there was...they had hardly anything themselves because as I explained, you know, everything had to go to the people who were fighting the war.</sentence><sentence id="635">But we did find some of this moldy old bread and some margarine and some sugar.</sentence><sentence id="636">And I still remember we, with our hands, we broke a piece of bread and if found any kind of utensil like a knife or spoon or whatever, fine.</sentence><sentence id="637">If not, we were just grabbing some margarine and

now.</sentence><sentence id="639">But it was the...the most delicious thing in the world.</sentence><sentence id="640">And we were so hungry.</sentence><sentence id="641">We were so starved.</sentence><sentence id="642">We were just...just stuffing it in as...as fast as we could.</sentence><sentence id="643">And this too was another thing we should not have done.</sentence><sentence id="644">You see people don't think.</sentence><sentence id="645">I mean under these circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="646">From total starvation to push all this very rich food into our bodies.</sentence><sentence id="647">The body couldn't take it.</sentence><sentence id="648">It rejected it.</sentence><sentence id="649">A lot of people died there within days.</sentence><sentence id="650">The body couldn't...couldn't absorb it.</sentence><sentence id="651">It couldn't take it.</sentence><sentence id="652">And people died from the very thing that should have saved them.</sentence><sentence id="653">And the Ger...the Russian soldiers came marching in.</sentence><sentence id="654">When they 4 saw us, they couldn't believe their eyes.</sentence><sentence id="655">I mean we were like skeletons.</sentence><sentence id="656">And most of the people had to be lifted from...you know, from practically crawling and they put us...put us on...uh...like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span>, you know, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>...put us into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span>.</sentence><sentence id="657">A lot of people were put into <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> where the doctors from the occupied forces started taking care of them immediately.</sentence><sentence id="658">They started to bury the dead.</sentence><sentence id="659">And then they started to take us out of there and finding us <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where the Germans who lived there who were witnesses to all of these, they saw us marching to and from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they knew what we were making and they were employed there too.</sentence><sentence id="660">This is a very big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="661">They were the people that trained us, what to do and how to do.</sentence><sentence id="662">And they knew that if they are caught by the Allies that they will be either punished or put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or whatever, so they too ran away.</sentence><sentence id="663">So there were these...their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and the Russian soldiers took us in and gave us these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to stay in until we are recuperated a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="664">And they brought us some food and medical care to these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where we stayed for...for about 2 or 2 weeks to gather a little bit of strength.</sentence><sentence id="665">And as we were getting stronger, there was only one thought we had.</sentence><sentence id="666">To get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to see if anybody from the family had survived.</sentence><sentence id="667">Our...what kept us alive all this time was thinking about and dreaming about them and hoping that we will meet again, that they'll survive as well.</sentence><sentence id="668">And then we'll be one happy family again.</sentence><sentence id="669">And this is what my mother kept me alive with.</sentence><sentence id="670">Always.</sentence><sentence id="671">And so here we...she said again, "Eat.</sentence><sentence id="672">Eat.</sentence><sentence id="673">Try to get a little more strength so that we can go as soon as possible.</sentence><sentence id="674">Try to travel back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and maybe your father is alive.</sentence><sentence id="675">Maybe your brother is alive.</sentence><sentence id="676">Maybe my parents, meaning her parents, and brothers and sisters... maybe somehow they survived too.</sentence><sentence id="677">So after about 3 weeks of this nourishment and medical care, we somehow had gotten back enough strength that we embarked on this journey back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">A lot of the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> were bombed.</sentence><sentence id="679">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> on a lot of miles and miles.</sentence><sentence id="680">So we tried to...uh...hitch a ride from farmers to carry us to a certain distance and then when...where they had to get off, then we tried some mode mode of transportation and it took us several weeks until we finally got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="681">A journey which going there took us only about 3 days and 3 nights, now it took us that many weeks to get back.</sentence><sentence id="682">And when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we went back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived, there were tenants of ours who lived in small...my father also owned some <span class="INT_SPACE">rental apartments</span>...<span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">And these people who worked for us or were people that worked on the <span class="REGION">property</span> and so on, were the ones that moved into our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">And when we have come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they looked out the <span class="DLF">door</span> or the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and they had seen my mother and I and they looked at us with bewilderment in their eyes. "</sentence><sentence id="685">What.</sentence><sentence id="686">You're alive.</sentence><sentence id="687">We were told you were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="688">And you are alive."</sentence><sentence id="689">I mean they themselves had to repeat it.</sentence><sentence id="690">They couldn't believe because they were, apparently, told by the Germans, you help us and you will inherit their goodies, their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, their <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and everything...all these...these valuables they take away from them.</sentence><sentence id="691">You are going to be the beneficiary.</sentence><sentence id="692">So when they had our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, they had our <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and here they saw the two of us come back, they were petrified.</sentence><sentence id="693">They would have to give up their...our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="694">They're...our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">Our <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">And they were just...they just couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="697">They were just so unhappy that they just couldn't hold in their feelings.</sentence><sentence id="698">And we said, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="699">We don't want it.</sentence><sentence id="700">We don't want...we don't want to even live here.</sentence><sentence id="701">We just want to see if any of our families came back.</sentence><sentence id="702">Did you see any of our <span class="BUILDING">families</span>?</sentence><sentence id="703">That's all we want to know."</sentence><sentence id="704">And, of course, they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="705">And then little by little, other people trickled back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">And we all were put up in one of 5 the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to live there until we found if anybody...any other families come back and decide what we want to do from then on.</sentence><sentence id="707">And there were these people coming back and we kept asking everybody, "Did you see my father?</sentence><sentence id="708">Did you see my brother?</sentence><sentence id="709">Did you see anybody from the family?"</sentence><sentence id="710">And the answer was always no.</sentence><sentence id="711">So we stayed and stayed and every time somebody came back again and again we ran and again we tried to ask, "Did you see anybody from our family?"</sentence><sentence id="712">And the answer was always no.</sentence><sentence id="713">And this went on for a good couple of months.</sentence><sentence id="714">And nobody would tell us if they had seen them or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="715">They were all looking for their families.</sentence><sentence id="716">It was the same.</sentence><sentence id="717">We were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="718">We were all looking for our families.</sentence><sentence id="719">Then after several months, finally somebody had pity on my mother and myself and he told us exactly what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="720">He said, "Don't wait for your husband and your father or your son and your brother.</sentence><sentence id="721">They're not coming back."</sentence><sentence id="722">I said, "How do you know?</sentence><sentence id="723">What do you know?</sentence><sentence id="724">Please tell us."</sentence><sentence id="725">Begging him, "Please tell us."</sentence><sentence id="726">He didn't want to talk at first.</sentence><sentence id="727">He just said, "Go away far from here.</sentence><sentence id="728">Go away.</sentence><sentence id="729">You don't want to stay here.</sentence><sentence id="730">They're not coming back."</sentence><sentence id="731">Then he finally told us exactly what took place.</sentence><sentence id="732">My father and my brother were together also in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>...in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">And my brother got sick.</sentence><sentence id="734">He had just turned 20 like a month before.</sentence><sentence id="735">And worked very, very hard no matter how sick he was.</sentence><sentence id="736">There was no medical care.</sentence><sentence id="737">There was no food.</sentence><sentence id="738">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="739">So he got very, very sick.</sentence><sentence id="740">And without any food and without medical care, he died.</sentence><sentence id="741">And then my father saw his only child, his only son die in front of him.</sentence><sentence id="742">And they had heard through rumors that traveled, you know, through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> somehow maybe somebody was assigned to a...a job outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and traveled there with the SS, and they heard a little piece of rumor here about families and what happened to the other people and or somebody else and they got...they paid off...whatever.</sentence><sentence id="743">Maybe they pulled out the tooth from their mouth, and they gave the gold of the crown to an SS for a little bit of information.</sentence><sentence id="744">So whatever way they could, but they got some information.</sentence><sentence id="745">And the information that they got was that all the women were killed right away as were actually old and young were killed, but they were told that all the women were killed because they felt that they would be of no use to the German and they didn't want them to spend money and food to give it to the women that they were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="746">So my father, thinking that we were all dead and he saw his only son die in front of him, he no longer could eat.</sentence><sentence id="747">He no longer had the will power to go on.</sentence><sentence id="748">And he too shortly after died. (</sentence><sentence id="749">crying) When we heard this, my mother turned to me and she said, "We no longer have anything to live for.</sentence><sentence id="750">We have nobody.</sentence><sentence id="751">Let's take our lives too." (</sentence><sentence id="752">crying) And I told her that I had just turned 15.</sentence><sentence id="753">I was so young.</sentence><sentence id="754">I wanted to go on and see if there is something beautiful in this world...if there are some good things in people...if there are some good things in this world to where people lived...not just suffering and ugliness that we have seen.</sentence><sentence id="755">I just wanted to go on and see some goodness and some beauty.</sentence><sentence id="756">And she told me that if I wanted to go on living her duty as a mother was to go on to help me survive and go on.</sentence><sentence id="757">So after this we just packed those couple of things that were our belongings and we...at this point already while we were staying there waiting for people to come back and hopefully my father and brother and the rest of the family would come back, the...uh...borders between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> where we could go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> where a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to...we actually wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> where we knew...we heard from people that people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> they could get on...uh...to different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or toward <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, and to start a new life.</sentence><sentence id="758">So 6 we wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, but the <span class="DLF">border</span> was already closed down because there was already the beginning (clearing throat)...excuse me...of the cold war so the <span class="DLF">border</span> was closed down by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at that point.</sentence><sentence id="759">So we had some money and some jewelry because before we were taken away that we knew things were bad and my father had taken some jewelry and also he had some dollars, you know, for...actually it was...a lot of people saved these because you never knew, we felt that this was...the war coming and what we would need it for, so instead of having...uh... Hungarian money, they traded...changed it into dollar bills and some jewelry...jewelry was traded into dollar bills, you know, to if need be...if we have to do anything to be able to possibly pay off whoever could possibly help us, you know, to escape in some way or another.</sentence><sentence id="760">So he dug some <span class="DLF">holes</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> in the back.</sentence><sentence id="761">We had a very large property and we had some <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> where he...uh...rented it out to people.</sentence><sentence id="762">And so he dug several <span class="DLF">holes</span> and different people where he left some jewelry in a little jar and put it in a ground and covered it up and then another sealed jar air tight, put...you know, put some dollar bills in there and hid those just in case.</sentence><sentence id="763">We didn't know where, what's going to happen, but just...if any <span class="NPIP">where</span> we're taken or we can come back at any time and we need something to...to help us survive...whatever.</sentence><sentence id="764">We didn't know what to fear, but there it was so we should all see it.</sentence><sentence id="765">So when the war was over, and during the nighttime when the...our tenants...the neighbors who moved into our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were sleeping, we went...my mother and I went with a shovel and a pick and tried to find the little <span class="NPIP">spots</span> where...these different little <span class="NPIP">spots</span> where my father hid these pieces of jewelry and some...not many.</sentence><sentence id="766">Just...this is one way again.</sentence><sentence id="767">He had money in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> so that in case we can possibly get to that, you know, that we can help ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="768">If not, then this is another way of possibly doing it.</sentence><sentence id="769">There were people who...there were an occasional righteous Gentile then as we know it today, which we didn't know the names of, but before we were taken over, there were some people who...who warned some of the Jews that try to escape because things are going to bad.</sentence><sentence id="770">And...uh...some of them even hid them.</sentence><sentence id="771">Others...they were able....some of the people bought for money...big, big money...uh...papers, false papers, the identity of a Christian person that looked somewhat like the person that was buying it.</sentence><sentence id="772">And they would...uh...go into a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they would hide where they would not be known and tried to hide that way.</sentence><sentence id="773">And there were still others who were...ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> or wherever they could possibly hide.</sentence><sentence id="774">And...uh...at that time we didn't even know what was to happen, so my father was trying, in his way, to protect.</sentence><sentence id="775">So this was his way that if we ever some how need it, we have that.</sentence><sentence id="776">So when we found this jewelry and the money, we paid the Russian guards at the <span class="DLF">border</span> to get us out and get us through into <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> from where we could go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and from there on wherever we can possibly go.</sentence><sentence id="777">So we paid a good part of this found money and jewelry that..uh...my father hid to get us out of there at that point.</sentence><sentence id="778">And so we made our way back to...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, where most of my mother's family had lived prior to the war.</sentence><sentence id="779">Part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span>, which again was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>...and back and forth, you know.</sentence><sentence id="780">And so we stayed there and we hoped that some of the family that lived there would perhaps survive and come back.</sentence><sentence id="781">And we stayed there for awhile and one of my mother's brothers and one of her sisters of 8 siblings did come back.</sentence><sentence id="782">So we stayed together for awhile and then...uh...[ had a marvelous memory at the time.</sentence><sentence id="783">And I remembered the address of my mother's younger sister who came out on that last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="784">How I remembered it I don't know, but I did.</sentence><sentence id="785">And I wrote a letter...uh...to say that we have survived and if there 7 was any way that they could send us papers so that we could come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because we could...couldn't possibly live where all this took place, where our neighbors helped the Germans...uh...extradite us and...you know, just so that we can be taken away so they can benefit from our plight and from, you know, our suffering and they can get all our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and all of that.</sentence><sentence id="786">So there was no way that we could stay and live there among these people.</sentence><sentence id="787">Just...just couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="788">So we had to get away as far as we could.</sentence><sentence id="789">And the only person that we knew that was alive or we assumed that survived was my mother's sister in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="790">So when I wrote the letter and I told my aunt that, "That's all.</sentence><sentence id="791">There's just the four of survived, you know, from the whole big family.</sentence><sentence id="792">And if they could send us papers."</sentence><sentence id="793">And then they wrote back to us, "By all means.</sentence><sentence id="794">They'll do anything and everything, you know, to get us out from there."</sentence><sentence id="795">But anything and everything, again, took another 4 years.</sentence><sentence id="796">We had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the <span class="REGION">Munich area</span> where we were in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and there we applied for a visa.</sentence><sentence id="797">But I am sure you know that what it is when anybody wants to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="798">You know every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is allowed a certain number of people to come in.</sentence><sentence id="799">And...uh...our visa being Czechoslovakian...that's because I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> you know...it was very, very small.</sentence><sentence id="800">So we had to wait there from about May of 1945 until March of 1949 to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="801">So we lived in, again, in...what they called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="802">Not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, again in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">But in this time instead of the...the horrible <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> that we were sleeping in...uh...we had already <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> to sleep on.</sentence><sentence id="804">But, of course, no privacy because...uh...there were hundreds of families in each...each of these little...uh... <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the only privacy we had was, you know, we were given some...uh...blankets and we would tie strings across and create just a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> like maybe...uh...8 feet by 6 feet or something like that where we had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span>, one for my mother and one for myself and a little, sort of a box or something where we kept the little bit of food that we were given by the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, the UNRRA" that...uh...was part of the American liberation system there at the time.</sentence><sentence id="805">And...uh...so that's where we lived for 4 years to wait to get...to go to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would accept us that we could start a new life.</sentence><sentence id="806">And...uh...March 9th, 1949, is when my mother and I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where her sister and brother-in-law met us.</sentence><sentence id="807">And we...practically everybody I think...bent down and kissed the good old American soil because this finally meant freedom.</sentence><sentence id="808">We were finally, after all these years, free.</sentence><sentence id="809">So my aunt and uncle took us with them to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="810">They lived near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span>, <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span>, and we stayed with them for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="811">And they wanted us to stay there.</sentence><sentence id="812">But I was only...I had just turned 18 at the time, and where they lived there were either the all grown-up, older people with grown children who were married and with little babies or people, young married people.</sentence><sentence id="813">But there was nobody that was Jewish that was my age.</sentence><sentence id="814">And at that point I could not communicate with anybody other than a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="815">I just couldn't!</sentence><sentence id="816">Cause everybody was the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="817">Everybody was different.</sentence><sentence id="818">They...they didn't go through what we went through.</sentence><sentence id="819">They...we were different people.</sentence><sentence id="820">It was like...I don't know whether it was they that were green people with...uh...with little horns or we were the ones.</sentence><sentence id="821">Couldn't decide which except that we were completely different.</sentence><sentence id="822">So I had nothing in common with any of the young degThe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</sentence><sentence id="823">8 people.</sentence><sentence id="824">My aunt and uncle tried to put me back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so I learned something and I couldn't do that because I saw all the teachers the way I saw them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>: anti-Semites and making things miserable and unhappy, so I didn't want to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">So we stayed there from March until the 4th of July.</sentence><sentence id="826">And then we went...uh...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to visit my mother's aunt and cousins who came in the 20s to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="827">And so we visited them just supposedly for a few days, but then we saw that there were a lot more Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, more people my age that I could possibly communicate with and learn from and start a life.</sentence><sentence id="828">Because I was 18, but I was, in fact, only 13 because those years were nothing.</sentence><sentence id="829">Those were erased from my life.</sentence><sentence id="830">So I was 13 years old in a 18-year old girl's body.</sentence><sentence id="831">And I didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="832">I was a frightened little girl.</sentence><sentence id="833">I could not communicate with anybody except the immediate family, my mother's sister and brother-in-law and their son, their only son.</sentence><sentence id="834">And then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="835">My mother's aunt and her cousin.</sentence><sentence id="836">I... couldn't go out to the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="837">I was petrified.</sentence><sentence id="838">I was afraid that the Nazis are still out there.</sentence><sentence id="839">I was having nightmares for years and years.</sentence><sentence id="840">For many years, I was still reliving everything.</sentence><sentence id="841">The trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, the...the beatings, the killings, the dead people that were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, the...the beatings and the...the dogs that were...uh....released and just jump on the people and...and tear them apart.</sentence><sentence id="842">I lived with this.</sentence><sentence id="843">Years and years!</sentence><sentence id="844">I still live with it, but I don't have these horrible nightmares anymore except occasionally.</sentence><sentence id="845">After a day like, for example, today I'm sure I'll have some of it.</sentence><sentence id="846">But this was for years.</sentence><sentence id="847">And it was a horrible, horrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="848">But I did...we did decide to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because my mother felt that I have a better chance of starting a new life among Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> as opposed to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mining town</span> in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> where there were no Jews my age.</sentence><sentence id="849">So somebody in the family who had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">clothing factory</span>, took me into his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and taught me how to use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="850">And after I worked there for awhile, then I got another job.</sentence><sentence id="851">Finally, I was able to get a job.</sentence><sentence id="852">This was my third job in another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but I actually got paid.</sentence><sentence id="853">I was paid 25 dollars a week at the time.</sentence><sentence id="854">And my mother was always very good in caring for people because she was a very, very caring person all her life.</sentence><sentence id="855">If I just think back of her when I was little girl back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, she used to take food and clothing to poor people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> without them knowing where it came from...that it was from our...us children or her best friend's children or from her best friends from themselves, but she would bring the clothing and she would cook for them.</sentence><sentence id="856">And she would <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> for them and she would go with her little basket on her arm and daily visit poor people and bring things to them.</sentence><sentence id="857">So that even after the war was over and we were for 4 years in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, she went to work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="858">Of course, she didn't get paid.</sentence><sentence id="859">You know, this was just a volunteer work.</sentence><sentence id="860">And she had worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and taking care of anybody that had any kind of illness, minor, major, but she was working along with the doctors in the...in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="861">And then...so when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, it was only natural for her again to go into something that is caring...something that she can take care of people.</sentence><sentence id="862">So she went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish facility</span> to take care of old women and men.</sentence><sentence id="863">Again because that meant taking care of people.</sentence><sentence id="864">So after awhile I met a boy that was American-born, who was college graduate and we were dating.</sentence><sentence id="865">I was finally, after several years, able to get to that point that I was able to go out on dates because when I first started after a year or two being in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I was still a nervous wreck.</sentence><sentence id="866">I had a horribly nervous stomach and I was always petrified of everything.</sentence><sentence id="867">And when 9 I first started to date I would go with...with a young man, maybe to a movie and then to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="868">And when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, I had to excuse myself several times to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> because I had to throw up because I had such a horribly, nervous stomach because I was still a petrified, little girl.</sentence><sentence id="869">So then finally, I think about 19...uh...57, I met this young man.</sentence><sentence id="870">And...uh...I seemed...I really liked him a lot and he seemed to like me and we started to date and by that time I was a little bit better as far as being so scared and nervous and all that.</sentence><sentence id="871">And he kept talking to me that I should go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="872">At first I wouldn't hear of it.</sentence><sentence id="873">Again because I was still seeing <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like it was.</sentence><sentence id="874">But then he talked and talked and talked and he said, "I'll go with you and I'll sit with you in the classes for a while.</sentence><sentence id="875">Just try to go back."</sentence><sentence id="876">So I was working five days a week in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="877">I... signed up because I didn't have any papers that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>...<span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="878">All those <span class="NPIP">things</span> were lost.</sentence><sentence id="879">I had nothing left from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">So I started to go back...I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="881">And at first he was coming with me, and then little by little 1 was calm enough that I was beginning to learn to the point where I did full four years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in two years at night.</sentence><sentence id="882">So I would get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work about 6:30 in the evening and my mother would have dinner already because where she worked in this <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, she would start at 7 o'clock so she would get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about...uh...3:30, 4 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="883">So she did some shopping on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then she cooked dinner.</sentence><sentence id="884">So I had almost a half an hour in which I was able to have dinner and grab my books, walk two blocks to the first <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span>, then take that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to a second <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span>, and took the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="885">And this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the Theodore Roosevelt evening high school, right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Fordham University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="886">And I went there for 2 years, and I was an excellent students.</sentence><sentence id="887">I got all my grades A's or A minus, and I tried very, very hard and this is...Up the Down Staircase is where I met my husband-to-be.</sentence><sentence id="888">He was also a survivor and he too lost at least 90 percent of his family.</sentence><sentence id="889">And from a large family, he and two brothers survived.</sentence><sentence id="890">That's all.</sentence><sentence id="891">All his parents, grandparents, all his siblings, there were 8 children.</sentence><sentence id="892">They were all gone.</sentence><sentence id="893">And then he asked if he could drive me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="894">And we started to chat on occasion and get to know each other a little bit and within 6 months, we decided to get married.</sentence><sentence id="895">We fell in love.</sentence><sentence id="896">We had an awful lot in common, which I felt or which we both felt was very important in a marriage and for...for us to build a life for ourselves again.</sentence><sentence id="897">And so we did get married.</sentence><sentence id="898">And 2 years later, we had a little boy who confirmed life again. (</sentence><sentence id="899">crying) We won!</sentence><sentence id="900">Hitler didn't kill all of us.</sentence><sentence id="901">We started a new life.</sentence><sentence id="902">We were very, very happy.</sentence><sentence id="903">And then 2 years later, we had another little boy, and we were just in <span class="NPIP">seventh heaven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="904">And we were a family again. (</sentence><sentence id="905">crying) My mother was alive.</sentence><sentence id="906">She remarried soon after my first son was born.</sentence><sentence id="907">Somebody in the family knew this gentlemen who lost his wife who also came out to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in the 20s.</sentence><sentence id="908">And he lost his wife and he was alone and he was a very nice person and he had his own business for many years and at this point he was retired.</sentence><sentence id="909">And he was lonely.</sentence><sentence id="910">And some members of the family knew him.</sentence><sentence id="911">And then when he met my mother and they saw what a lovely caring person she is, they wanted them to meet and they got married.</sentence><sentence id="912">And they were very happy for about 5 years.</sentence><sentence id="913">And there Florida...were in... were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> for a wedding on his side of the family.</sentence><sentence id="914">And when they came back from the wedding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span>, he had a heart attack and died in front of her.</sentence><sentence id="915">So she had to see the second time around. (</sentence><sentence id="916">crying) So this poor woman who lost her parents, sisters, brothers, lost her husband and her son had to go through this again.</sentence><sentence id="917">The only thing that I think kept her alive after that 0 was my two sons.</sentence><sentence id="918">She had to have something to live for cause otherwise she could not have made it.</sentence><sentence id="919">She was in very bad shape for 2, 3 years.</sentence><sentence id="920">I mean very bad.</sentence><sentence id="921">Very, very bad!</sentence><sentence id="922">She moved back with us.</sentence><sentence id="923">At this point we already bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a two-family <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> upstairs rented.</sentence><sentence id="924">So when she couldn't be alone, we asked these people that lived with us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we had to have...give my mother a <span class="BUILDING">home</span>. (</sentence><sentence id="925">crying) Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="926">She moved in with us.</sentence><sentence id="927">She has her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> upstairs and we were downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="928">We were just one family.</sentence><sentence id="929">My mother was working part-time, and I was...I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="930">At this point I already loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="931">At this point I wanted to see beautiful things, and I wanted to learn about the world, about good people, about good things.</sentence><sentence id="932">There are...there are some good things in this world.</sentence><sentence id="933">And I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to study interior decorating.</sentence><sentence id="934">And so I was able to create and help create beautiful things.</sentence><sentence id="935">I went to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="936">I went to <span class="DLF">gardens</span>, <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="937">I took my children to the ballet and to the opera and I taught them everything...showed them everything beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="938">And we lived a very happy life at this point.</sentence><sentence id="939">We worked very hard.</sentence><sentence id="940">And then my mother finally stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="941">She took care of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the cooking and when the boys came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, she was there to meet them.</sentence><sentence id="942">And I was working and I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the evening, of course.</sentence><sentence id="943">My husband would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and we were again living a normal family life.</sentence><sentence id="944">And, as the boys, were growing my mother got sick.</sentence><sentence id="945">One Saturday morning as I was going...about to go to work and I came down from upstairs where, you know, we already had moved into a larger <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at this point in a very nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="946">And we were on our way really to a nice life and she moved with us to this new nice...nicer <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="947">And then one morning as I was getting ready to go to work and she was already downstairs and I was coming down from my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I heard some horrible moaning of pain.</sentence><sentence id="948">And I got scared.</sentence><sentence id="949">I didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="950">And I ran down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she was sitting there completely doubled over with some excruciating pain.</sentence><sentence id="951">I didn't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="952">So L..uh...called up her doctor and when I told her what happened, he said to put her into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and take her straight to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where he'll meet us.</sentence><sentence id="953">After lot's of tests and everything, they discovered that she had cancer of the colon.</sentence><sentence id="954">For 2 years she was suffering with this.</sentence><sentence id="955">I took her to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia Presbyterian Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, which was considered one of the very best.</sentence><sentence id="956">I found the very best...uh...specialist in this type of cancer who performed surgery and he found the oncologist who treated her afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="957">And I took her twice a week, once to her regular doctor for a checkup, and once a week to the oncologist.</sentence><sentence id="958">For 2 years she suffered like this.</sentence><sentence id="959">She passed away.</sentence><sentence id="960">She passed away in 1978.</sentence><sentence id="961">So we were back to four of us.</sentence><sentence id="962">And the same week when we buried her, my two sons went away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="963">So it was a tough time again.</sentence><sentence id="964">Mourning my mother, having the boys go away.</sentence><sentence id="965">But life went on.</sentence><sentence id="966">After a certain period of time, I went back to work, continuing...trying to survive and continue to make a life again.</sentence><sentence id="967">And my sons went and they graduated from <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, both of the <span class="DLF">computer line</span>, and one is working for IBM on the shuttle program, and the other one is also in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span>, but he...he started for...with MCR, and now he is with another major company up in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="968">And our younger son lives...well, to back track a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="969">Uh...After my husband was with a company for 22 years as the manager who...that was owned by two brothers-in-law who were hardly ever there because they were able to get away because my husband was a very, very responsible man and he worked very hard to keep the business running as well as he could possibly go, and they were very happy 1 with him.</sentence><sentence id="970">And he was with this <span class="BUILDING">company</span> for 22 years.</sentence><sentence id="971">And then one of the brother-in-laws reached the age of...into the mid 70s, and he felt that he was...he had enough and he wanted to be out.</sentence><sentence id="972">And so...uh...he...my husband went with this new company, but he wasn't very happy there.</sentence><sentence id="973">So it was time to make another change, and at this point he had cousins in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span>, <span class="REGION">Texas</span>, where he was a pharmacist and...uh...he kept talking to us to come down because life is much quieter and nicer and business opportunities are there.</sentence><sentence id="974">He asked.</sentence><sentence id="975">We did come down on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacation</span> and within days decided it's time to make the next change.</sentence><sentence id="976">So we moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> where we are living now.</sentence><sentence id="977">Our younger son lived...lived about an hour's drive from there.</sentence><sentence id="978">He works at the <span class="BUILDING">space center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="979">And...uh...we see him and talk to him very often, and our younger son remained up north and we see him only about 2, 3 times a year, but talk to him continue...all the time.</sentence><sentence id="980">And so we are a very close family even though we are not always together.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1387">Q: I think at this point, this seems a perfect finish to stop.</sentence><sentence id="1388">I want to say thank you for being here and doing this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1391">A: The only thing if I could add, I would like to.</sentence><sentence id="1392">What I do now, although I work full time, is that I belong to a small group of people that's called the Holocaust Survivors Group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1401">A: And that our small group of us from this particular organization that go to different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and talk to the young people and tell them what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1402">Tell them about the Holocaust, our experiences, and tell them to read about the past and learn about it, and try in their lifetime as they go, that they can stop from things like this from happening.</sentence><sentence id="1403">And it's up to the young people...that today's generation to prevent something like this from happening again.</sentence><sentence id="1404">So I go from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and from organization to organization and from <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and talk to all the groups and not just I, but this nucleus of about a dozen people to share our plight and our experiences and to ask them and to teach them to be aware and be watchful and care about people.</sentence><sentence id="1405">And when somebody is being persecuted for whatever reason to help and to speak up and we just go on and try to remember the past and hope to make a better life for the future.</sentence></p></dialogue>
