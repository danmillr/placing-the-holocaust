<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1173">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1174">At the beginning, now I felt very uneasy about the Germans and about the whole situation.</sentence><sentence id="1175">But we were, at the beginning, we were very free to do whatever we wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="1176">I don't remember exactly when they started registering, but it was right at the beginning, that Jews had to register and then I think that we didn't have to start wearing the white, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> you wore the</sentence><sentence id="1178">3 white arm bands with the blue star of David, and everything, the Germans had a system.</sentence><sentence id="1179">You see they didn't just file everything, all the bad things all at once.</sentence><sentence id="1180">It was very, very gradual so you somehow seemed to get use to it.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And at first it was registering, then it was the armbands, then you couldn't ride in the front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span>, then you couldn't ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="1182">You couldn't go into the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1183">You couldn't do a lot of things but it was all so gradual that you almost didn't realize that that was happening.</sentence><sentence id="1184">And then they started talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1185">That all the Jews will have to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1186">But that didn't happen until really 1941.</sentence><sentence id="1187">And so a whole year went by where we moved around and things were quite, you may say even safe.</sentence><sentence id="1188">And my parents were getting ready to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I said that I did not want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because, I just felt, that's when I really started to get afraid.</sentence><sentence id="1189">And I remember I even said something that, what would happen if they would just close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> one beautiful day and set fire to it.</sentence><sentence id="1190">And everybody thought I was just being ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="1191">I mean, nobody would do a thing like that.</sentence><sentence id="1192">Why would they do it?</sentence><sentence id="1193">I said, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1194">We read about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Christalnaught</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1195">We read about things that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and why wouldn't they happen here?</sentence><sentence id="1196">Everybody thought I was just ridiculous and exaggerating.</sentence><sentence id="1197">And the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) made arrangements to take over the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1198">And have my father, my Uncle and my brother work there as essential to running the <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> so they would be safe and, at that time, we still lived in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1199">And since they couldn't conveniently go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span>, the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> right in their <span class="DLF">back yard</span> instead of in the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1200">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> in the back and they would transport my father and my brother and my Uncle to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, which was quite a ways away.</sentence><sentence id="1201">It was at the other end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And so everything seemed to be going quite well and the business was good.</sentence><sentence id="1203">Mr. Mo-stof-ski (ph) was running it and he was a lawyer, he knew all kinds of angles as far as business was concerned, and they gave my father and my Uncle money to live on.</sentence><sentence id="1204">And plenty.</sentence><sentence id="1205">Then the Germans started invading <span class="INT_SPACE">people's apartments</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span></sentence><sentence id="1207">4 and they simply taking whatever they wanted to take.</sentence><sentence id="1208">They came one evening to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they tagged <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and they tagged the , which was our most precious possession, and several other things, and that's when my father started to get a little bit concerned, not scared.</sentence><sentence id="1209">And then again the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) came to the rescue.</sentence><sentence id="1210">Oh, the Jews were forbidden to own any furs, fur coats, and being in the leather business, of course, my mother had not one but several fur coats, and the Mo-stof-ski's (ph) took those.</sentence><sentence id="1211">And we had some very beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, especially my parent's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> set was mahogany and some very exotic <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1212">There were large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobes</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dressers</span>, so they took that.</sentence><sentence id="1213">And several other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1214">And also jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="1215">So things were still not bad.</sentence><sentence id="1216">But then when the talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closer and closer, I just said, "I will not go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>".</sentence><sentence id="1217">And that's when a friend of ours suggested that Yannosh and I get married.</sentence><sentence id="1218">And this way I would be a Hungarian citizen, I would be on his passport.</sentence><sentence id="1219">I didn't have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1220">And my parents were sort of opposing to it.</sentence><sentence id="1221">They thought I was way too young to get married.</sentence><sentence id="1222">I was only nineteen, but I had just turned nineteen that January, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And they, but they agreed.</sentence><sentence id="1224">And as a matter of fact, my mother gave me her wedding band and my father gave Yannosh his wedding band.</sentence><sentence id="1225">So that we could have wedding bands for getting married and we did get married by some Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="1226">It was a very short ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="1227">My mother was too ill, as I mentioned before, she was sick after the birth of my sister.</sentence><sentence id="1228">And so she was not witnessing, but my father went and my brother and Yannosh and I and we had a very brief ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="1229">But we were married legally and I moved into his <span class="BUILDING">parent's house</span>, or <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1230">And then I went to visit my, by then my mother and father and Uncle and Aunt and my brother and my sister moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1231">They had a fairly large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, which they shared, but not for very long because they put more and more people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1232">They also brought people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and they had to, they were allowed only one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1233">And then my Uncle and my Aunt had another very small <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, but my father, my sister, my brother, they</sentence><sentence id="1235">5 all were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1236">And then they all shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1237">So it wasn't exactly the luxury we lived in but still my father was working and they had enough food because he could, he went to work every day and he brought back food and there were no really preserves and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerators</span> as such at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1238">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they were in very bad .</sentence><sentence id="1239">You went shopping everyday for food and so he brought fresh food everyday.</sentence><sentence id="1240">And my mother was able to, with the help of my Aunt, to run the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> up to a point.</sentence><sentence id="1241">So things weren't really bad.</sentence><sentence id="1242">And I went and visited them practically every

ridiculous."</sentence><sentence id="1340">I mean, I just gave them my husband's phone number.</sentence><sentence id="1341">They still were allowed to have a phone, the Hungarian citizens.</sentence><sentence id="1342">So they will get in touch with him</sentence><sentence id="1344">6 and everything will be all right.</sentence><sentence id="1345">And what I didn't know about the girl, evidently she was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without papers, hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1346">And she was waiting for some false papers to be given to her.</sentence><sentence id="1347">But at that point she didn't have them.</sentence><sentence id="1348">Well anyway, the Gestapo were quite mean to her.</sentence><sentence id="1349">They were all uniformed and they were quite mean to us.</sentence><sentence id="1350">They were shouting and then asking questions and I kept on insisting that I was a Hungarian citizen and they should get in touch with my husband and let me go.</sentence><sentence id="1351">And I remember they put us against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, facing the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1352">And it was a little creepy because the girl started to cry and she started to point at the spots on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and she says, "That looks like blood and they are going to shoot us, and I know they will shoot us".</sentence><sentence id="1353">And they did have guns.</sentence><sentence id="1354">And, but that was the first time when I faced that maybe they will shoot me.</sentence><sentence id="1355">And it's a very funny feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1356">You know?</sentence><sentence id="1357">You are completely helpless.</sentence><sentence id="1358">You cannot do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1359">And you just stand there.</sentence><sentence id="1360">And you feel kind of a creepy feeling on the back of, between you're shoulders, and you wonder, are they going to shoot between the shoulders or are they going to shoot you in the head?</sentence><sentence id="1361">And I think I got a little bit sick to my stomach but I didn't cry.</sentence><sentence id="1362">I just was waiting.</sentence><sentence id="1363">And then one of the guys walked up to us and just turned us around by the shoulders and started to ask more questions.</sentence><sentence id="1364">And they took the girl away, but they were asking me more questions and more questions, and they wanted to know where my parents were and why I was there and what was I doing?</sentence><sentence id="1365">And I don't exactly remember all the answers I gave them, but I know that I insisted that they call my husband.</sentence><sentence id="1366">And finally they brought some woman who took me to a, I guess a kind of a <span class="BUILDING">mass prison</span> for other women that they were catching or who ever they were, and we just slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1367">There was a bucket in the <span class="INT_SPACE">comer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1368">And no sanitary facilities of any kind except the bucket.</sentence><sentence id="1369">And I didn't like it, but I decided I am going to just sit and wait.</sentence><sentence id="1370">And the next morning, I didn't get anything to eat, the next morning they gave us some coffee and some bread and anyway, I</sentence><sentence id="1372">7 stayed there for about two days.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And low and behold, my husband came to get me and they let me go.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1455">Q: When was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1457">A: That was about the beginning of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="1458">It was spring of 1941 because I know I still had my nice, winter coat with the sable fur no less.</sentence><sentence id="1459">My mother had sables that she brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and she finally, one day, it was still before the war, she decided that I can have a coat trimmed with these sables.</sentence><sentence id="1460">And I had a big muff and a fur collar and a hat.</sentence><sentence id="1461">And I have a picture of that <span class="NPIP">someplace</span>, in a family album.</sentence><sentence id="1462">So anyway, I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I would not leave.</sentence><sentence id="1464">But then things happened to the Hungarians too.</sentence><sentence id="1465">And we were evicted from the fancy <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1475">Q: This was in 1941 also?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1477">A: No that was already in 1942, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="1478">Because that was after <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, no, I really don't remember exactly the dates, but I know that it was, in 1942 we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">barber</span>, near the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1479">And then they decided to tear this down, tear the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> down because they were going to build something else there.</sentence><sentence id="1480">And we found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the</sentence><sentence id="1482">8 <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law made a living by teaching English in secret.</sentence><sentence id="1484">And that's where these friends of mine came into picture.</sentence><sentence id="1485">I wrote the whole story about them to, how they were helping us throughout it.</sentence><sentence id="1486">They were helping us with the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and with other things because it was one of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends and her mother.</sentence><sentence id="1487">The mother had a small <span class="BUILDING">jewelry store</span> and <span class="BUILDING">perfume store</span> and she had all kinds of connections.</sentence><sentence id="1488">And, but this is a story for itself and I have about fourteen pages written up for the ee about it.</sentence><sentence id="1489">And she was very, very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1490">My mother-in-law had quite a bit of jewelry, which Mrs. was her name, would sell it for us for a good price.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And she was very, very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And then finally, she also permitted my sister-in-law and my mother-in-law to use their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for classes, for the English lessons.</sentence><sentence id="1493">Because this was the only means of support we had at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1494">My husband was working in a <span class="BUILDING">German furniture store</span> but after a while he lost that job and so he wasn't working anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1495">Then we moved, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was being enlarged and the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where we lived was going to be enclosed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we had to move.</sentence><sentence id="1496">And we moved to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called Why-give-neek-ee (ph), which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1497">And we rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from a man called Borcha Hur-oog (ph), to this day I remember, and it was a Krakow-ofska 493, or something like that address and I tried to find it.</sentence><sentence id="1498">And Why-give-neek-ee (ph) is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="1499">At that time it was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>-kind of a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with no indoor plumbing and the water was from the <span class="DLF">well</span>, you had to put a bucket down and then crack up a bucket and bring the water up.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And it was an <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1501">Also another thing that happened in the meantime is that my father-in-law had a stroke and he had a heart condition and he was partially paralyzed.</sentence><sentence id="1502">He was ina bad shape.</sentence><sentence id="1503">But slowly he recovered somewhat that he was able to walk around but one arm was paralyzed and his speech was slightly slurred, so he stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> most of the time with me and the</sentence><sentence id="1505">9 grandmother while the sister, my husband's sister and his mother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to give English lessons.</sentence><sentence id="1506">So that was my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> living.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1537">Q: So tell me again, how many people you were living with in you're <span class="BUILDING">husband's house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1539">A: There were six of us, including me.</sentence><sentence id="1540">There was the grandmother, the father, the mother, the sister, my husband and I.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1557">Q: Okay, before we go into that, would you, when you lived in this country spot, in this smaller place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, did you continue to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to visit you're family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1559">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1560">I continued.</sentence><sentence id="1561">And not only that, but I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1562">I did get some kind of a paper from the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> at that time, some kind of an identification so then I started walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> again and I was a little bit more free.</sentence><sentence id="1563">I remember even, I baked cookies, which I would take to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and try to sell.</sentence><sentence id="1564">I sold them most of the time, they were very good cookies.</sentence><sentence id="1565">They were wartime cookies, they weren't really delicious but they were as good as you could get them at that time, so I was in cookie business for a while.</sentence><sentence id="1566">And also, by then, in 1943 the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="1567">By that time, it was liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="1568">By that time my father was gone, my mother and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="1569">And my brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poroshkov</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1570">And Ches-waf (ph) was giving him the money in food and also giving me some.</sentence><sentence id="1571">So he was supporting us quite generously.</sentence><sentence id="1572">Because they were still running the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1573">But that was after March, 1943.</sentence><sentence id="1574">Still April, 1944.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1591">Q: So when did you're father, when was you're father deported?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1597">A: My father was deported with the first transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, which was, as far as I remember, it was first few days in June when they rounded them up.</sentence><sentence id="1598">I think June 3rd or June Sth, I think June Sth is when the <span

the first time, I was telling Robert, describing it, and we were looking for it and we couldn't find it until . . .</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1600">[End of Side A of Tape

went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1603">A: Robert, this husband.</sentence><sentence id="1604">Because that's already a third husband.</sentence><sentence id="1605">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1606">Anyway, Robert and I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and we went to the for the , which was, the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1607">, a <span class="BUILDING">drug store</span> which was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and right now it is a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1608">And Mrs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1609">Swaveka Karlingska (ph) is one of the, was one of the, I don't know if she still is there, people that ran the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and she told us that the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1610">You see, I only thought that they went to the main <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> but she told us exactly where they went and so we traced that <span class="DLF">road</span> and we found the grassy knoll and I told Robert that there was a little religious statue on it and we found it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1611">Because I remember standing right next to it when the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in rows of four started coming out and very slowly they were marched with the SS men and the dogs and the whole business.</sentence><sentence id="1612">Right through the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613">And I did see my father.</sentence><sentence id="1614">And after that, I think I started to cry and my husband grabbed me.</sentence><sentence id="1615">Because there were a lot of people, Polish people standing there and jeering really, and "Getting rid of the Jews", and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1616">And I know he was afraid that somebody will notice that I am crying so he grabbed me and led me out of there, against my better judgment, but anyway, I left.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1621">Q: You knew about the deportation before it happened?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1622">A: Well we were told that they are going, that some of the people have to deport and have to report at this particular <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1623">And that they will be resettled to a, to some <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1624">And they wanted people who were trained in certain jobs.</sentence><sentence id="1625">And Mr. Mo-stof-ski (ph), father, was trying to get my father out of that registration because he said that he needed him to run the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1626">But they said that he had my Uncle to do it so he didn't need my father.</sentence><sentence id="1627">You see, my father was really just in his fifties but he had white hair and so he looked probably much older than he really was.</sentence><sentence id="1628">And Mo-stof-ski (ph) couldn't do anything to get him out of that.</sentence><sentence id="1629">So I knew that they are going to be deported but I wasn't sure whether my father was rescued or not.</sentence><sentence id="1630">Mo-stof-ski (ph) didn't know either.</sentence><sentence id="1631">So that's why I went to the knoll, to see who was really going, and I saw some friends of mine and another girl that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with and her father and her sister.</sentence><sentence id="1632">But they were very heavily guarded and one could not do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1633">And my father, I remember him standing there with a small suitcase and he had this mannerism of scratching his head when things weren't so, I remember him scratching his head.</sentence><sentence id="1634">And then my husband took me away from there.</sentence><sentence id="1635">And then, you see, I could go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by just showing that piece of paper that I had from the government.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1636">And so I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the next morning because they kept the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> closed that day, but the next morning they again let the workers go out and people come in.</sentence><sentence id="1637">So I went to visit and my mother, of course, was very, very upset.</sentence><sentence id="1638">But she said that she was hoping that everything will be all right.</sentence><sentence id="1639">They promised that they will be put to work and then maybe even she will be able to join him later on.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And it seems to me now, I don't quite remember whether it was my Uncle or whether it was my father, but she got a post card from somewhere, that the transport arrived and that everybody was all right.</sentence><sentence id="1641">And then there is a crazy thing, my mother was superstitious or something, she believed in all kinds of signs and, if a bird knocked on the <span class="DLF">window</span> it was a bad sign, and my</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1644">2 father left her his watch, his pocket watch, and she said the glass cracked.</sentence><sentence id="1645">I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="1646">I saw the glass cracked.</sentence><sentence id="1647">And she said he was dead.</sentence><sentence id="1648">And I told her, "This is silly."</sentence><sentence id="1649">Maybe somebody knocked the watch over and what not, and she said "No", it was by her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed table</span> and all of a sudden the glass cracked.</sentence><sentence id="1650">And I didn't believe that, I felt it was all crazy.</sentence><sentence id="1651">And anyway, I would come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and bring her the food and whatever else they needed and I went there practically every day.</sentence><sentence id="1652">My brother was in and I saw him and he could come out and visit too.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And then he had a girlfriend on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, a Polish girl that use to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lab</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1654">And then, when Mo-stof-ski (ph) took over the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> he transferred her to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and she was a secretary there and she was helping my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1655">And one day, she told me that he was taken on a transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>, to some <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1656">And I never heard from him again.</sentence><sentence id="1657">Though her brother, Da-new-chef (ph) was her name, her brother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>, and he kept in touch with my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1658">But when we went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I tried to find out what, whether it was a camp or a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, what happened to those people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> and I just couldn't find it.</sentence><sentence id="1659">Na-new-sha's (ph) brother died and I had her address and I wrote to her many times, but she's not a young woman anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1660">And she may be dead for all I know.</sentence><sentence id="1661">So she is the only one who really was in touch with my brother before I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1662">So I have no idea what happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="1663">And every year we go, I try to find her, I try to find anybody that would know about anybody from taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>, and I wasn't able to find anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1664">So that's the story on that.</sentence><sentence id="1665">And then we are coming closer to the march, thirteen's or whenever that was, that was 1943, which was the like liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1666">My mother was partially paralyzed too, I mean her arm was bad.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1667">But she still could get around.</sentence><sentence id="1668">And my sister was five years old, she was born March 6th.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And I was there for her birthday.</sentence><sentence id="1670">I brought her chocolate and stuff, and some toys.</sentence><sentence id="1671">And you could, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> went from , the place that I lived out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1672">It had to go</sentence><sentence id="1674">3 through the <span

class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1676">And it took three days for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to be liquidated, but I made arrangements with Dan-o-sha (ph) to get my sister out.</sentence><sentence id="1677">My mother didn't want to, but she was very realistic and she thought, yes, that I should take the girl.</sentence><sentence id="1678">We had false papers for her and I brought Dan-o-sha (ph) the girl's clothes and I remember there was a little coverlet for her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>, she was five years old but she still had it, and we bribed the guard and I was suppose to go in and take her out.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="1680">I could not get in.</sentence><sentence id="1681">They still let the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> go through because that was the only way that people could get from one end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="1682">But the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="1683">The SS men were hanging on the <span

I went back and forth the first day.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And there was no way I can get the child out.</sentence><sentence id="1686">And that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1687">And then, you probably saw enough of the photographs and pictures, from Schindler's film and from this and that, and you know what it looked like.</sentence><sentence id="1688">It looked probably much worse than anything you saw in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1689">And so, I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1690">I know some people were taken on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prostejov</span> but these were young people who could be still working.</sentence><sentence id="1691">Then most people were killed right in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but then they said that there were several transports of women and children taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And I could not find, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and I tried to find out whether there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that came.</sentence><sentence id="1693">There was another crazy story, that there was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with the children and women that

out.</sentence><sentence id="2222">What was wrong with me is that I got some kind of an infantago infection, or whatever it was, on my legs.</sentence><sentence id="2223">And I had sores all the way

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2366">Q: And I wondered if you could tell me, you mentioned that you met a friend, Betsy Gordon, and that you were, at first you weren't working but then you were working doing sewing with her?</sentence><sentence id="2367">And I wondered if you could say how it happened that you came to, that you met her and you started working there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2370">A: Well it seems to me that Betsy, now I don't remember whether we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then she arrived later or she was already there.</sentence><sentence id="2371">Because we were together with the other Hungarian people.</sentence><sentence id="2372">And even though she came from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and she was a dancer, I don't know exactly what kind of dancer, but I know that she looked like an actress with lots of make-up and the dyed hair.</sentence><sentence id="2373">And she was very beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="2374">And she was there.</sentence><sentence id="2375">It seems to me like she already was there.</sentence><sentence id="2376">That she was deported just like we were, as a Hungarian citizen living <span class="NPIP">abroad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2377">Living in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was occupied or in some way connected with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2378">And we were all in the same <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2379">And the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were very clean, they were very well kept.</sentence><sentence id="2380">And we slept in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> which were just regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> bends, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lower bunk</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2381">And the older people slept in the lower <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and the younger slept in the <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">linens</span> as such.</sentence><sentence id="2384">I can't remember, I just don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="2385">But I know there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span>, there wasn't just a board with maybe some straw or maybe just a thin blanket.</sentence><sentence id="2386">But there were, they might have been <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span>, which are very popular in Europe, or they might have been just some kind of things, sacks filled up with whatever filling they had.</sentence><sentence id="2387">And anyway, they were not as bad as we had come later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2388">And</sentence><sentence id="2390">7 everything was very clean.</sentence><sentence id="2391">We had to clean it ourselves but there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brooms</span> and there were cleaning supplies and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> with running water.</sentence><sentence id="2392">So the things weren't really, it was not as primitive as some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2393">And I know that at first we didn't do anything and it was rather boring.</sentence><sentence id="2394">And there were a lot of people from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, I think I mentioned that, diamond cutters.</sentence><sentence id="2395">And they definitely would not work in anything.</sentence><sentence id="2396">They were kind of sheltered because their hands could not get ruined because they wouldn't be able to do the precision work evidently that's required of a diamond cutter.</sentence><sentence id="2397">So they were more sheltered.</sentence><sentence id="2398">And I don't really remember exactly what we were doing and what we were sewing, but it seemed it wasn't on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2399">It seems to me that we were repairing things, maybe they were uniforms, maybe they were just things from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2400">I just don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="2401">But I know that we didn't just sit idly the whole time.</sentence><sentence id="2402">And again we had three meals a day, I mean there were no scrambled eggs for breakfast, there was just maybe a piece of bread with some margarine and coffee, which was usually kind of brown water but at least it was sweetened with saccharine I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="2403">And then for lunch we had sandwiches and again coffee.</sentence><sentence id="2404">And in the evening there was some kind of soup with maybe some meat and lots of potatoes and vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="2405">And we weren't hungry.</sentence><sentence id="2406">As a matter of fact, I, you know, we could get seconds on soup.</sentence><sentence id="2407">It was very surprising to us that that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and we were wearing our own clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2408">All the suitcases came with us and we had them right in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2409">And so we could change and that's when I discovered that our suitcases were pilfered, still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, because a lot of things were missing.</sentence></p></dialogue>

that time, we really didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was except that they were sending people there.</sentence><sentence id="2463">And also the university professors were arrested and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2464">Now we rarely didn't hear from him, and then he came back about eight months later, and as I say the dates, I don't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="2465">I know that he has stacks of books of his memoirs left because he showed them to us and they were all in Polish and I said I would love

the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="2469">And he came back and he was really in <span class="INT_SPACE">seclusion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2470">And it was, I was still very young then and I really didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2471">But the thing that I remember was that Yesh-e (ph) would not talk to anybody about things.</sentence><sentence id="2472">What happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="2473">What he was doing.</sentence><sentence id="2474">Why he was let go.</sentence><sentence id="2475">And he just wouldn't say anything of what happened to him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2476">But then when Robert and I were visiting them last summer, Yesh-e (ph) showed us his memoirs and also he was an amateur painter, well he thought of himself more than an amateur, but anyway, the walls of his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> were just filled with paintings.</sentence><sentence id="2477">And some of the paintings were depicting his life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, in the white and blue uniforms and the thing that he told us was about Father Colbert who

police.</sentence><sentence id="2480">And because</sentence><sentence id="2482">9 of, I think it was something about the tickets on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, but anyway they wanted to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2771">A: Well that indicated to me that there was something wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2772">That, we knew a little bit about the, it was called in Polish "wa-pon-ka" (ph), that means "catching", catching people.</sentence><sentence id="2773">And we knew that they did catch people, they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and drove them away, and they were rounded up and so I thought, well, I think that's the end of the people being nice to us.</sentence><sentence id="2774">That something is very, very wrong.</sentence><sentence id="2775">And it was sort of a, not only a premonition but really we realized that things are not going to be good.</sentence><sentence id="2776">So that was my first indication that something was wrong.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2785">A: The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and they brought us to, again, I tried to find

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2789">And then when we got off, they told us that we didn't have to get the suitcases off and they just took us to this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was quite a commotion, that we were delivered on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and there was this half-dead grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="2790">And from all the description that I remember, from Dr. Mengala (ph), it seems to me that it was Mengela (ph) who came in and gave the grandmother a</sentence><sentence id="2792">6 shot and she just died, just like that.</sentence><sentence id="2793">And then there was shouting going on and we really didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2794">They separated the men and they separated the women.</sentence><sentence id="2795">And they told us to undress.</sentence><sentence id="2796">I mean, we were the four women and the men were somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="2797">And we saw quite a big crowd of people <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2798">Just like you see the pictures of the refugees, these children and women and men, just walking very slowly.</sentence><sentence id="2799">And then they, some women came in and took us to a <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">door</span> that opened and they put us into the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2800">And it was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> not bigger than maybe 10 by 12, maybe, I couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="2801">The <span class="DLF">door</span> opened from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and they pushed in the men.</sentence><sentence id="2802">And so here we were and they closed the <span class="DLF">doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2803">And here we were in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, it was made out of brick or plaster, I just don't

what I think today it was, that when we were being de- loused, they were putting, we would undress in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and put out clothes on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span>, which was wheeled into a sort of <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span>, the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="2807">Then we went through <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2808">That wasn't when, that was later when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2809">Then we went through <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, and then on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> we would get our clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2810">And it seems to me that they had several <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> like that because there were thousands of us at one time that they were giving us the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2811">And it seems to me that that was the <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> that we were locked into.</sentence><sentence id="2812">And after a while, I mean, we just stood there, but for just a few moments, a few minutes, the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and they pushed in two women, naked.</sentence><sentence id="2813">And they threw in a little baby that looked kind of crippled, they just threw it on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> again, and then we knew that we were done for.</sentence><sentence id="2814">And nothing was happening.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2815">And you know, sometimes you can't, sometimes time goes very fast and sometimes time stands still.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2816">And at that time it was standing still and we didn't cry, we didn't scream, we didn't do anything.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2817">And the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and one of the SS men, I think he had papers in his hand, he says, "The people</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2820">7 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> are here, are they here?",</sentence><sentence id="2821">in German.</sentence><sentence id="2822">And somebody said, "Yah-vol" and then they said "Rouse".</sentence><sentence id="2823">So we started walking out and the two women, they were counting us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2824">Evidently they knew how many of them were suppose to be.</sentence><sentence id="2825">And they pushed the two women back in.</sentence><sentence id="2826">And shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> and put us in an identical <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, right next to it.</sentence><sentence id="2827">And I don't know how long we stayed in there but, maybe ten minutes, maybe twenty, maybe five, I couldn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="2828">And we could hear muffled screams and it sounded like the baby mostly.</sentence><sentence id="2829">But not, it was, and then it was quiet.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2830">And then they opened our <span class="DLF">door</span> and they said, "Rouse", so we went out and they told us "</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2831">"and we all nodded.</sentence><sentence id="2832">And then they took the men again on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and us the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, the four women.</sentence><sentence id="2833">And there were a whole bunch of, there was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the big <span class="DLF">windows</span> on each side and these were Jewish women who were evidently in charge of preparing the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="2834">And they were quite friendly, they were very nice.</sentence><sentence id="2835">The first thing they did, they put us on small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stools</span> and with what do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="2836">Clippers, they weren't electric clippers, they had to do it like this in order to shave your head, and they shaved our heads and the pubic hair and the hair under the arms.</sentence><sentence id="2837">And it all was in a pile and I had very beautiful hair, sort of reddish-blonde curls, and

the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, it was already winter, and I remember she cooked all kinds of stuff that she got in the package.</sentence><sentence id="3335">And I remember she gave me a little bit of the potato water that she cooked the potatoes in, she didn't give me the potatoes but she gave me potato water in the bowl, and I shared that with Betsy.</sentence><sentence id="3336">But I don't know that, we heard that the Red Cross was bringing packages.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3338">Q: If you would just go ahead.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3342">A: We can start with the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3343">I got some kind of an infection.</sentence><sentence id="3344">I think it started with probably some chigger bites or some bug bites that I got working <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3345">And I always was quite sensitive and would scratch.</sentence><sentence id="3346">I know that I scratched my legs and then I guess because of the dirt and things that we lived in, I got some kind of an infection.</sentence><sentence id="3347">It might have been also fleabites or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3348">And it was getting worse and worse to the point where my legs were very, very swollen.</sentence><sentence id="3349">And I could not walk even.</sentence><sentence id="3350">Pus was oozing and these were big, round circles all over my shins.</sentence><sentence id="3351">And so they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they really didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="3352">I think they put some Vaseline or something over the wounds and covered it with some gauze and there I was lying and hoping that it will heal.</sentence><sentence id="3353">But at the same time, the German doctors were coming in and drawing blood from us.</sentence><sentence id="3354">And then injecting us with something and I have no idea whether these were suppose to be medications or whatever, but anyway.</sentence><sentence id="3355">Then they were also doing vaginal and rectal examinations with their fingers.</sentence><sentence id="3356">Which wasn't exactly what I considered pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="3357">And it was rather very humiliating.</sentence><sentence id="3358">I just didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3359">I was not the only one.</sentence><sentence id="3360">There were several women that were singled out and we were sort of in a group and it was extremely humiliating.</sentence><sentence id="3361">I was only 20 or so and I just didn't feel that this was exactly the treatment I wanted to have but I was probably worried more about my legs.</sentence><sentence id="3362">And then I think I mentioned it before, that the women, there was a couple of Jewish women doctors and they said that they knew that there was going to be another selection in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> so they dismissed me together with some other women because they were afraid that the state I was in, I would have been selected to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3363">So I was put back into my regular <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I barely could walk.</sentence><sentence id="3364">But at that time, I was still working in that <span class="BUILDING">weaving business</span> so I didn't have to walk into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and I was able to stand during the roll call and then just go to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, which were right on the <span class="REGION">premises</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3365">So it wasn't like I had to go very far.</sentence><sentence id="3366">And eventually my legs healed but they were, I had sort of scars all over, from my ankles to my knees, and I tried to</sentence><sentence id="3368">8 be much more careful with scratching and things that may aggravate the condition.</sentence><sentence id="3369">My legs eventually healed.</sentence><sentence id="3370">It took about another month or so, but anyway, I was all right.</sentence><sentence id="3371">So this was another thing that I wanted to talk about.</sentence><sentence id="3372">The other thing that I wanted to say was that about two months before, two or three months before we were arrested, it might have been around Christmas time or maybe a little bit later, I discovered that I was pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="3373">And I went to a Polish doctor, a gynecologist who determined that I was about two months pregnant, maybe two-and-a-half, and he did an abortion right in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3374">And I was very sad that I had to do it but in the circumstances I couldn't possibly have a baby.</sentence><sentence id="3375">And if I did have one, I would have been pregnant when they arrested us and I probably wouldn't have survived anyway and the baby definitely wouldn't have been alive today.</sentence><sentence id="3376">But if you do think like that, if you just keep on thinking all you're life about the child that wasn't born.</sentence><sentence id="3377">So, this was another trauma that I had to live with.</sentence><sentence id="3378">Then I didn't give it much thought of course when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> as I said before, that nature takes care of itself and I didn't menstruate since we were put in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3379">And I didn't menstruate until I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3380">And I really think it was a blessing because I just cannot image thousands of women without any sanitary facilities having their periods.</sentence><sentence id="3381">Now the ones that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a long time, they and the cappos (ph), some that knew how to get around because their number was just maybe 400 or 300 or so, and they were the rich ones and they might have been normal already, but the rest of us just were sterile I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="3382">But what amazed me was that really, it was almost like a miracle that we didn't menstruate because it would have been a big, big mess.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3446">Q: Can you talk a little bit about how these two events that you just mentioned have effected you're life since then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3448">A: Well, as I said, you never stop thinking of the child that you, well I can't say killed, but didn't permit to be born.</sentence><sentence id="3449">And I have four wonderful children and you always think how wonderful that one might have been.</sentence><sentence id="3450">So my life was very much effected by everything that happened to me because to this day I have nightmares and I wake up and I don't know where I am, and I have all kinds of physical problems.</sentence><sentence id="3451">What was it, a year and a half ago I finally was sort of diagnosed with an ailment that I've had for about twenty years or so.</sentence><sentence id="3452">That I would come down with, or maybe more than twenty years, I came down with, suddenly, with high fever.</sentence><sentence id="3453">But it was like 104, and shaking and practically being unconscious.</sentence><sentence id="3454">And it would come on quite suddenly.</sentence><sentence id="3455">It would last for several days and usually I got better.</sentence><sentence id="3456">And it would happen like about every three to four months.</sentence><sentence id="3457">And eventually I got sort of use to it and I paid no attention to it anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3458">But a year and a half ago I had my neurosurgery, but two months later, again I got this fever.</sentence><sentence id="3459">And this time it was much more serious because I, well, Robert knows because he was taking care of me.</sentence><sentence id="3460">It was so bad that, you know, you don't call you're doctor after hours, and he got to call the doctor and find out what to do.</sentence><sentence id="3463">0 Whether he should take me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3464">And my doctor, who is a physician, said that I have something called the Brill Zincer Syndrome (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3465">And she researched it and found out that a lot of people who had typhus in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, the which causes the typhus just becomes dormant and every so often it wakes up and causes the fever.</sentence><sentence id="3466">But usually they are mild attacks and very few people paid much attention to it.</sentence><sentence id="3467">But this time I was really seriously ill.</sentence><sentence id="3468">It was 104, you are not joking you know.</sentence><sentence id="3469">My doctor put me in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and just to do the tests, and they ruled out every possible disease that could cause this kind of symptoms, like tuberculosis and and fever, and what is the one in working, the Valley Fever, and anyway, I don't know how many tests they did and they send my blood to a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> and they were testing it for , but the strain that they had wasn't exactly, the results were quite inconclusive.</sentence><sentence id="3470">But when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the following Summer, Yesh-e (ph) was still alive and he said that he was a and he said that the strain of was a specific strain that was in <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> and it was called Ball-in-netsa (ph) or whatever, and he said that they should have tested for that and that definitely would have been positive.</sentence><sentence id="3471">But my doctor wasn't going to wait for any tests and he put me on very high doses of tetracycline.</sentence><sentence id="3472">And I was on tetracycline for about six weeks and the fever subsided and the tests were negative again.</sentence><sentence id="3473">And he says, well, let's wait for the six months and see whether you get anything again.</sentence><sentence id="3474">And I was sort of use to it, you know, it was just matter-of-fact.</sentence><sentence id="3475">I was getting use to it and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="3476">But it is already two years and I haven't had the fever anymore so they decided they killed off the .</sentence><sentence id="3477">And evidently you have to do it when the are active, when you have the fever.</sentence><sentence id="3478">And another symptom which was described in the book, because that was the first thing that the doctor asked, where is the rash?And I had a rash going from the armpit down the arm and that was the first thing that he asked, whether I had the rash because that was one of the very typical symptoms of this sort of syndrome.</sentence><sentence id="3481">1 So that's another thing that I had.</sentence><sentence id="3482">And another symptom that, now since we are talking about diseases, is that after I had, well maybe when we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> the second time we can talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="3483">Or should we talk about the diseases now?</sentence><sentence id="3484">Because another thing was I had typhus in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3485">Everybody had typhus.</sentence><sentence id="3486">I didn't have tuberculosis, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="3487">But there are spots on my lungs that are calcified, but it's sort of secondary symptoms.</sentence><sentence id="3488">It's really is not too significant.</sentence><sentence id="3489">I mean, I have something that's called a B Lung picture, but its, the thing that was was the typhus.</sentence><sentence id="3490">And another thing that people where getting was starvation edema.</sentence><sentence id="3491">And this was something that was really frightening because you woke up in the morning and you're eyes were swollen with bags under the eyes and they were getting more and more swollen during the day.</sentence><sentence id="3492">And that was it.</sentence><sentence id="3493">In three days you were dead.</sentence><sentence id="3494">I mean, it was just unbelievable because you could see the people swelling.</sentence><sentence id="3495">The faces would get swollen and the legs, the feet and the hands, and then eventually the whole body.</sentence><sentence id="3496">And as I understand this was diagnosed as starvation edema.</sentence><sentence id="3497">And I didn't get it to that extent.</sentence><sentence id="3498">And my legs were very swollen, my feet were swollen and my face just a little bit but somehow I recovered from it.</sentence><sentence id="3499">I didn't die.</sentence><sentence id="3500">But it was very, very frightening and I have absolutely no tolerance for salt.</sentence><sentence id="3501">I am on an almost salt-free diet most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="3502">If I go to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, like for example today, and I had the tuna fish sandwich, I will have to take medicine when I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3503">And I am on medication the whole time, the dietetics.</sentence><sentence id="3504">And my doctor who is fairly new in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because my old doctor retired and I got a new one, and he was very much against the dietetics and he just didn't think that I should take them.</sentence><sentence id="3505">And he asked me to stop it.</sentence><sentence id="3506">And two days later, Robert took me to the <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3507">I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3508">I gained about twelve pounds on the scale.</sentence><sentence id="3509">I couldn't open my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="3510">I could not talk.</sentence><sentence id="3511">I was so swollen that I couldn't even walk.</sentence><sentence id="3512">And Robert took me to the <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span> and the doctor could not believe it.</sentence><sentence id="3513">He said he has</sentence><sentence id="3515">2 never seen anything like it.</sentence><sentence id="3516">He says, you go back on you're pills and renewed my prescription.</sentence><sentence id="3517">And so these are still things that I've had since I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3590">Q: Did you ever learn what kinds of experiments were being conducted at all?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3592">A: No, I never learned.</sentence><sentence id="3593">All I knew is that they took quite a bit of blood from us and they were injecting us with something else and they were taking, but they were doing so many things of that sort that you just didn't pay any attention to it.</sentence><sentence id="3594">And I don't think that that cause any, that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and the edema came in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, so I don't think that those two have anything to do with each other.</sentence><sentence id="3595">And I don't know why I didn't get typhus in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, maybe because they were de-lousing us.</sentence><sentence id="3596">But the typhus was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3597">And of course the psychological effects of the whole experience is something else.</sentence><sentence id="3598">Because I go to the hairdresser, I put make-up on, and I was going, you know, I got three graduate degrees and I did very well.</sentence><sentence id="3599">I was on the Dean's list and I was, I got one of my Master's Degree's in art with distinction, and I entertain and I go out and I think I look very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="3600">But a lot of it is also a <span class="DLF">facade</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3601">Because Robert knows that there are times that, I call it I'm out of my head.</sentence><sentence id="3602">And I have to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nanny</span> for the kids because I couldn't always take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="3603">So I was very fortunate that I could afford, or my husband could afford it.</sentence><sentence id="3604">So we had a nanny for seventeen years, until Sir-re-high (ph) started <span class="BUILDING">High School</span>, so she was sixteen.</sentence><sentence id="3605">Well actually I had a nanny for longer than that because Margaret was with us for seventeen years and before that we had a nanny for five years.</sentence><sentence id="3606">So, I mean different nannies, but then we found one that stayed with us for seventeen years because I could not take care of the children.</sentence><sentence id="3607">And very few people know that because I, my kids were brought up and I participated in PTA and I just pretended that I lead a normal life.</sentence><sentence id="3608">And so I think I finish on the fact that I had a good facade and everything, but every so often the children would say, well mother you never really took care of us, it was Margaret who did.</sentence><sentence id="3609">But I tried to be a very good mother and I think I did do a good job.</sentence><sentence id="3610">I made sure</sentence><sentence id="3612">3 that they go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and do well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and what-not, but there were many times that, I call it I couldn't take care of them the way, you know, I should have.</sentence><sentence id="3613">And there was something, always, I think I held them when they were babies, but we had very little physical contact when they were growing up.</sentence><sentence id="3614">And even now, you know, it may be just a peck on the cheek or something like that, but you never see me kissing the kids and really hugging them.</sentence><sentence id="3615">I do with my grandchildren though.</sentence><sentence id="3616">My grandchildren I hug and I hold and I play with them, but somehow with my children, there was some kind of a <span class="DLF">barrier</span> that I couldn't break.</sentence><sentence id="3617">And I know it was all in my head and I was examined by a German psychiatrist for the restitution and he decided I was nuts.</sentence><sentence id="3618">Oh yes, they rewarded me restitution all right.</sentence><sentence id="3619">I get a monthly check because I figured out that they pay wasn't very high because, you know, at first they gave me a lump sum and it came out to about $5.00 per diem for the time that I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3620">But it was more than nothing, but then they awarded me a monthly pension and they adjusted it since I have been working, and then they said, well, if you are working you really can't or don't deserve the full amount.</sentence><sentence id="3621">But then I petitioned and I send more letters and I have a stack of correspondence with the German government, through my lawyer who is a German man and very, very helpful and he specializes in the restitutions, so that's another story that maybe worth preserving.</sentence><sentence id="3622">All the letters that we were sending back and forth to find out whether I am deserving or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3656">Q: What did you're psychological state have to do with the restitution?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3658">A: Oh, well what my psychological state was that I wasn't, okay, my husband was supporting me supposedly.</sentence><sentence id="3659">They wanted to know how much money he was making and so on and I insisted that in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, women are independent and I am not able to work.</sentence><sentence id="3660">You see, I didn't start working for money really.</sentence><sentence id="3661">For making a living, until my second husband died.</sentence><sentence id="3662">Before that when I was working, it was charity work and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="3663">And I was teaching at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> as a student teacher.</sentence><sentence id="3664">I wasn't</sentence><sentence id="3666">4 really working for money.</sentence><sentence id="3667">And so the reason that they awarded me the restitution was, it is really a pension.</sentence><sentence id="3668">Nobody can live on that pension because it was like $300.00 and then every year they adjust it for cost of living, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3669">So it wouldn't even pay half the rent for a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="3670">But I had to have a physical examination by a German doctor and who determined that I had a chronic edema, or whatever he called it, and then, I don't know, whatever else his diagnosis was, and then they decided to have me checked by a psychiatrist.</sentence><sentence id="3671">And he gave me the standard psychiatric examination and I had to fill out all kinds of questionnaires, you know, whether I feel that I am being followed and whether I can sleep or whether I can't sleep, do I have nightmares, and I actually had everything that he was asking for, so I said yes.</sentence><sentence id="3672">And then he decided that maybe I do deserve some kind of a pension because he didn't think that anybody would employ me in the state of mind I was.</sentence><sentence id="3673">So that's another story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3692">Q: We can come back in more detail to the restitution later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3694">A: Well, the thing is that as far as the restitution is concerned, I have copies of all the letters that I sent to the lawyer and the copies of his letters to me and the final judgment in all that.</sentence><sentence id="3695">It is all very interesting because it took like maybe several years of constant correspondence and wanting more proof and more proof of this and that and something else.</sentence><sentence id="3696">So, if you think that that would be an addition to it.</sentence><sentence id="3697">Because I really didn't hear anything about restitution in the whole <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3698">And there are a lot of people that are getting money from the German government.</sentence><sentence id="3699">One curious thing is that once a month in between the Ist of August, it has to be after the Ist of August and before the 1st of November, I have to fill out a certificate of life.</sentence><sentence id="3700">And it has to be notarized by a notary public.</sentence><sentence id="3701">Years ago it had to be also, not certified, but made true, I can't think of the, I can't think of the word, but it was in German and then eventually it started to translate it into English, that it had to be certified by a German authority.</sentence><sentence id="3702">So I had to send it to the German counsel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="3704">5 then I had to get it back and then I had to send it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3705">So this is something quite curious that I think very few people know about it.</sentence><sentence id="3706">Have you known about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3721">Q: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3734">A: When I got married in June, 1947 to Dr. Levin, we decided that we didn't want to have children the first few years because we both were going to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3735">And I wanted to get my degree from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3736">That's where he was going to be for three years in surgical residency.</sentence><sentence id="3737">So when we were even still in, we got married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span>, <span class="REGION">Texas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3738">And I went to a gynecologist for my pre-marital examination and he examined me and he told me that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant because he thinks I am completely sterile.</sentence><sentence id="3739">My fallopian tubes were plugged, scarred, and there was no way I could possibly get pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="3740">And so, of course it was a great shock to me.</sentence><sentence id="3741">I told him my history and he said, well, this is what contributed to it.</sentence><sentence id="3742">And I, of course, I didn't want to get married, because my future husband was from a large family.</sentence><sentence id="3743">There were six children and he was the only son.</sentence><sentence id="3744">Well, actually he had a half-brother, but he was the only son of his mother, and he, they definitely wanted to have a grandson or granddaughter, or whatever, so it was a great disappointment to him and he didn't tell his parents.</sentence><sentence id="3745">But he said he didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="3746">He still wanted to get married, even though I didn't, but we did get married.</sentence><sentence id="3747">And I just tried not to think about it.</sentence><sentence id="3748">But I tried to plan my life.</sentence><sentence id="3749">Definitely go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and have some kind of a profession so that I can be working and not missing the fact that I can't be a mother.</sentence><sentence id="3750">So, actually I was so busy with the university studies that I did not really have time to worry about anything else at that point.</sentence><sentence id="3751">But then, he was finishing his residency and I was finishing my graduate degree and we were going to move on.</sentence><sentence id="3752">And looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to settle.</sentence><sentence id="3753">And I thought that maybe I should do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="3754">But we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and I got a job as a Medical Technologist at Mt. Carmel Mercy Hospital and he was a surgeon there.</sentence><sentence id="3755">And we had a very good friend who was a gynecologist and we told him my predicament and he said that he will see what he can do.</sentence><sentence id="3756">He gave me a very</sentence><sentence id="3758">7 thorough examination and then I had, he put me on high doses of penicillin, back then penicillin was very much in use.</sentence><sentence id="3759">And so if there was any kind of infection, then it would definitely get cleared.</sentence><sentence id="3760">And then in addition he put me through quite painful treatments.</sentence><sentence id="3761">It is kind of a little complicated, these are uterine injections of lapydol (ph), which is a very heavy oil with, first he tried to blow the <span class="DLF">air</span> through and he wasn't able to, my tubes were definitely plugged.</sentence><sentence id="3762">And then lapydol (ph) is a very heavy oil and it has some kind of an additive to it that it will show up on x-rays, and so he injected that and the lapydol (ph) is suppose to go through the tubes and if they, and the weight of it sometimes will open them.</sentence><sentence id="3763">And the tubes are really opened into the <span class="INT_SPACE">abdominal cavity</span> and the good sign is when the lapydol (ph) spills into the <span class="INT_SPACE">abdominal cavity</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3764">And it's quite painful because there is some kind of a nerve connection, especially if, the pain is hitting the shoulders.</sentence><sentence id="3765">And nothing happened with the injection.</sentence><sentence id="3766">And he repeated it and after two days there was a spill on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3767">So he said, well, that was sufficient indication that things may be all right.</sentence><sentence id="3768">And a few months later I did get pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="3769">And so we spent a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and then I was about three months pregnant when we left.</sentence><sentence id="3770">And we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3771">And my daughter was born in August, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresno</span> in December and my daughter was born in August.</sentence><sentence id="3772">So things turned out for the best.</sentence><sentence id="3773">But without medical treatments and all, I probably would have not been able to have children.</sentence><sentence id="3774">The American doctor who examined me the first time, when I went there for my pre-marital examination, because I was getting married and I didn't think that I wanted to get pregnant right away, said that I probably would never get pregnant because my tubes were scarred and plugged up.</sentence><sentence id="3775">And that I don't have to worry about getting pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="3776">And he wanted to know what could have caused it.</sentence><sentence id="3777">And I wanted to know what the cause might have been and he says, well, one of the causes that usually plugs up the <span class="DLF">tubes</span> is an infection and its mainly gonorrhea and I said, well, how on earth would I have gotten gonorrhea and he says, well, you just think.</sentence><sentence id="3778">And you know you can</sentence><sentence id="3780">8 get gonorrhea by an intercourse with an infected person, which I did not have, and so I told him about the gynecological examinations that I was getting in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3781">And that when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with the skin infection, there were also doctors coming in and poking their fingers into us, and I did not think that they were having sterile gloves on because they were going from one woman to another without changing the gloves.</sentence><sentence id="3782">They were protecting themselves but not us.</sentence><sentence id="3783">And these were vaginal and rectal examinations and the doctor, the American doctor who examined me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span>, he said yes, that was sufficient to get you infected.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3835">Q: How long all told were you in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3837">A: I really don't quite remember.</sentence><sentence id="3838">It could have been, probably around ten days.</sentence><sentence id="3839">And one thing that I remember very distinctly was that sometimes they were dressing the wounds on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3840">We were in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> all the way around and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> in the center and they would put the patient there and several doctors would be standing around her and doing all kinds of things so that we couldn't really see, but one time I saw her legs.</sentence><sentence id="3841">I thought mine were in a bad shape, but her's were so bad that you could see the bone.</sentence><sentence id="3842">The flesh was just practically rotted away.</sentence><sentence id="3843">And one of the things that they would, they didn't do the maggot treatment to me, but it was very popular in Europe to use maggots to treat this kind of wounds.</sentence><sentence id="3844">And I know that her legs were just crawling with maggots.</sentence><sentence id="3845">And evidently maggots were putting some kind of an enzyme or whatever, that was killing the dead tissue.</sentence><sentence id="3846">Or maybe they were eating the dead tissue and that stimulated the granulation and growth of the new tissue.</sentence><sentence id="3847">And that was one of the cures.</sentence><sentence id="3848">So they did use maggots, but they didn't use penicillin.</sentence><sentence id="3849">They didn't use maggots on me, I somehow got better.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3863">Q: Were they treating you in any way that was productive?</sentence><sentence id="3864">That was helpful?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3867">A: Well, as I say, it seems to me that they put some kind of an ointment on my wounds and they were somewhat helpful, so that the oozing stopped.</sentence><sentence id="3868">It looked like Vaseline, but I can't believe that</sentence><sentence id="3870">9 Vaseline alone could have cured, but anyway, at least the things were not full of mud and dirt, which I would have gotten in the regular <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, or even going to work.</sentence><sentence id="3871">So there were bandages, they bandaged my legs and they were at least kept clean.</sentence><sentence id="3872">I was a pretty healthy and strong person at that time and I guess it was my resistance and just my natural ability to heal.</sentence><sentence id="3873">And to this day I heal very well.</sentence><sentence id="3874">I get a cut on my finger and two days later it is gone, so maybe it was just my ability to heal well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3883">Q: And you mentioned that you left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> before you were completely healed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3885">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3886">I left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> because of the on coming selection.</sentence><sentence id="3887">And the doctors that were there, the women doctors, they were Jewish women doctors.</sentence><sentence id="3888">They were afraid that the selection may not be very selective and they may just reduce the number of patients so they didn't want anybody who was well enough to walk out, was asked to walk out.</sentence><sentence id="3889">And as I say, after that, I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I was able to stand the roll call and I was able to walk to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were plaiting the braids.</sentence><sentence id="3890">And sitting all day, I could still keep my bandages on my legs and then I think a couple of times, as I recall, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I had the bandages changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3897">Q: Did you ever see Yannosh (ph), you're husband, during this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3899">A: Yannosh (ph) disappeared about half way.</sentence><sentence id="3900">I think I saw him a few times and I said he came on some errands, he brought some stuff with the other workers to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3901">And I don't know exactly what, and I was able to say a few words to him.</sentence><sentence id="3902">But it was not more than two or three times.</sentence><sentence id="3903">The first time when he came was to, he told us that father died, and that was just maybe like a few days, maybe a week or so, maybe two weeks after we were separated into the different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3904">He died very soon after he got there.</sentence><sentence id="3905">But I didn't see Yannosh (ph) maybe for three months and after that I didn't see him anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3906">| don't think I saw him after October.</sentence><sentence id="3907">As I remember, the last time I saw him was the weather was still bearable and then in October it started to get very cold and snow, and</sentence><sentence id="3909">0 I know I didn't see him anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3910">And I told you before that when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, that there were two guys that said that they knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and that he was selected and that they never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="3911">And evidently because he was crippled.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3925">Q: Do you remember that last time you saw him?</sentence><sentence id="3926">What you said to him, what you said to each other?</sentence><sentence id="3927">Anything about that last time you saw him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3931">A: I didn't know it would be the last time.</sentence><sentence id="3932">I didn't think that each time was the last time, but there was very little that we could say to each other.</sentence><sentence id="3933">It was, I don't remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3937">Q: And you mentioned there was another <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you were working, beside in that, another <span class="NPIP">place</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3939">A: Yes, I was also working on some kind of a brick-laying place.</sentence><sentence id="3940">And I remember one thing, that one of the guards complimented me.</sentence><sentence id="3941">That I had a very good ability to measure the distances because my bricks were laid very evenly and I was spreading the mortar, I think I was buttering a slice of bread, and that the bricks were built very, very evenly and very nice.</sentence><sentence id="3942">And what we were working, and that was a very short time that we were working on it, were large, round, brick structures.</sentence><sentence id="3943">It doesn't seem to me that they were ever finished, but by then we, of course, we knew exactly about the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> and we knew about everything else.</sentence><sentence id="3944">And what these structures were suppose to be was, and I don't know whether that was the hearsay or whatever, but that's what we were kind of hearing, that these were going to be special <span class="BUILDING">extermination places</span> with sort of electrical contraptions that would be electrical crematoria and electrical killing, the high voltage.</sentence><sentence id="3945">But I don't know whether that was true and I never really found out what these structures were.</sentence><sentence id="3946">And when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I was telling Robert about these structures and the first time we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> he says, that's what you described.</sentence><sentence id="3947">And I said, yes, that's what I was working on.</sentence><sentence id="3948">And</sentence><sentence id="3950">1 we never found out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> what these things were supposed to be.</sentence><sentence id="3951">But it was very, we probably will go again and I'll try to find out what they were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3965">Q: They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, these <span class="BUILDING">structures</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3967">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3968">Right past the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>, or along side the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3969">And I don't think they were ever finished.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3973">Q: You mentioned earlier that by the time you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> you were hearing more news of the war and of the outside world.</sentence><sentence id="3974">Do you recall some of the news that you heard?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3977">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="3978">I just know that, well actually it was more in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen-Bergen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3979">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen-Bergen</span>, whatever news we got was when the new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came.</sentence><sentence id="3980">But all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that were coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> were mainly from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> or from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, from smaller <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3981">And they were very small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3982">And it seems like, as I mentioned before, that they all seemed to be of prisoners or some political people that were rather taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="3983">As I say, we weren't, we didn't seem to be doomed or anything.</sentence><sentence id="3984">Just like the <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> diamond cutters, they were being sort of guarded and preserved.</sentence><sentence id="3985">And so, if a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came, they might have told us what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="3986">But we really didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="3987">But while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, there were underground radios and then also there were a lot of workers who were going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and coming back in the evening and they would bring some news that what was happening on the front and what was happening with the war.</sentence><sentence id="3988">And at one point we knew that the Russians were coming and that the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="3989">That there was an uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3990">And I just don't remember really.</sentence><sentence id="3991">We were much more concerned about surviving from day to day than worrying what was happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3992">There were raids, air raids.</sentence><sentence id="3993">There were quite a few air raids and we were hoping that they will bomb but they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3994">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> were swooping down but they were never really throwing any bombs on the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> and we were disappointed because we</sentence><sentence id="3996">2 thought that maybe they would destroy the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>, they couldn't be used.</sentence><sentence id="3997">But they were saying that it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> that were coming.</sentence><sentence id="3998">And we could hear the anti-craft shooting, but I don't think they ever shot down any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> either, but they were just shooting at them.</sentence><sentence id="3999">And so, but we really had very, very little contact with the outside world.</sentence><sentence id="4000">And when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, we didn't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="4001">But we haven't gotten to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="4002">We are still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4003">A couple escaped, there were people escaping.</sentence><sentence id="4004">And we witnessed one hanging of a couple that escaped.</sentence><sentence id="4005">And we understand that there were more escapes and more hangings, but we did witness one.</sentence><sentence id="4006">And there were also suicides.</sentence><sentence id="4007">I mean, it was very easy to commit suicide if you could just get to the high voltage wires.</sentence><sentence id="4008">And some people did.</sentence><sentence id="4009">Another thing that happened that was quite a regular occurrence were the latrines.</sentence><sentence id="4010">I mean, we had to go when we were ordered to go and I don't know whether you saw the pictures, I didn't see any pictures in here of the latrines, but it was a cement kind of a block in the center of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with <span class="DLF">holes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4011">A double row of <span class="DLF">holes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4012">And you were supposed to do your business there.</sentence><sentence id="4013">And that sure was not a very pleasant sight or a very pleasant time.</sentence><sentence id="4014">And this one thing that I was really suffering from was constipation and to this day I still have to be very careful what I eat and what I do and the timing because, I don't want to talk about it, Robert.</sentence><sentence id="4015">But maybe this is important that it is recorded too.</sentence><sentence id="4016">I mean, you don't like to talk about these things, but I remember one night.</sentence><sentence id="4017">I mean, at night if we had to go, there was a bucket.</sentence><sentence id="4018">And I remember one night I had to go and the cappo (ph) would not let, and I think it was Betsy with me, they wouldn't let us until we emptied the bucket.</sentence><sentence id="4019">And the bucket was about, like a 30 gallon <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span>, maybe 25 gallon <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span>, I know it wasn't as high as that, it was about this high.</sentence><sentence id="4020">And she said we have to carry the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> that you poured it in, before we can use it.</sentence><sentence id="4021">And that's not a very pleasant feeling either.</sentence><sentence id="4024">3 Especially when, if you do have an accident, there's no clean clothes that you can put on.</sentence><sentence id="4025">And there is no way of washing it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4075">Q: So two people would carry these buckets and these buckets are about two or three feet high?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4077">A: About two and a half feet high.</sentence><sentence id="4078">Like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage can</span>, but it was more like a drum with sort of handles, wire handles or something, and we carried that.</sentence><sentence id="4079">And it was pretty full.</sentence><sentence id="4080">And we were trying to carry it very carefully so that it wouldn't splash because, as I said, if it splashed on us we had no way of clean up and these probably were the worst times.</sentence><sentence id="4081">Probably much worse than not having enough food.</sentence><sentence id="4082">Because you really dealt with, I don't really want to say, but it was shit.[Laughter] But that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="4083">And I can't understand how I can laugh now, I really can't.</sentence><sentence id="4084">But I do.</sentence><sentence id="4085">Maybe that's why I survived.</sentence><sentence id="4086">Maybe that's why I'm not completely crazy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4098">Q: You mentioned that there were hangings going on, or that you witnessed one hanging.</sentence><sentence id="4099">What was the reason?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4102">A: They escaped and they were caught.</sentence><sentence id="4103">They were brought back.</sentence><sentence id="4104">There were more hangings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prostejov</span> and they always made hangings public to scare us, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="4105">But my brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prostejov</span> and he had a girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="4106">And I think he was quite fond of her and he was still able to go out because he was going to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, that was after my father was already gone.</sentence><sentence id="4107">And he came, I never saw him cry.</sentence><sentence id="4108">He was a very brave guy.</sentence><sentence id="4109">And that time he came in and I had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to meet him and I would bring him some food and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="4110">And he said that they were, that they did hang the girl and some other people with her.</sentence><sentence id="4111">And why?</sentence><sentence id="4112">Somebody tried to escape and they caught them and then they just took people at random and she was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="4113">And he said, it could have been him, it could have been anybody else, but they did hang her.</sentence><sentence id="4114">So, I try not to think about these things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4128">Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape or do anything?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4133">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="4134">Because we knew that it was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="4135">I mean, the people that did escape, I really don't know of anybody that escaped and wasn't caught.</sentence><sentence id="4136">Because the way the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was situated, it wasn't like there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and you can just hide and whatnot, unless you had really help from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4137">And I really don't know much about it.</sentence><sentence id="4138">All I know is that between the barbed wire, electrified, and the guards in the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span>, and the dogs, it was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="4139">That anybody who would try might as well finish off on the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4177">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4178">I think, I am quite sure that it, you see, some of the dates I try to remember, but I think it was the 29th in the evening because it was dark and I remember Doot-sie (ph) jumping up and down trying to join us.</sentence><sentence id="4179">They separated her from Betsy and me because we were going to go on</sentence><sentence id="4181">5 the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4182">And I don't know what was better, whether to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but we had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="4183">And I felt very, very bad about leaving her because her mother was gone all ready and she was just left alone.</sentence><sentence id="4184">And I know she was crying and she looked like a skeleton all ready and we didn't look much better, but she looked really bad.</sentence><sentence id="4185">And that's why they didn't let her go.</sentence><sentence id="4186">They selected people that were in a better shape I guess, so I didn't think that I'll ever see her again, and I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="4187">But I also thought that I wouldn't see her again because she wouldn't survive the ordeal.</sentence><sentence id="4188">But she did survive.</sentence><sentence id="4189">And I think I mentioned all about her before, but anyway Betsy and I were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4204">Q: Can we go back just a bit to when you mentioned Doot-sie (ph) mother had already been separated from you.</sentence><sentence id="4205">Will you tell me when that happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4208">A: Well that happened about two or three weeks before.</sentence><sentence id="4209">You see, we went to <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> and the de- lousing so-called.</sentence><sentence id="4210">And when we were completely undressed, you see the routine was as I said we bundled our clothes and put it on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> which was wheeled into the de-lousing compound which I think were the temporary, provisional little <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, but anyway, that's where we were.</sentence><sentence id="4211">In a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we undressed and then the SS men came in and started to whip right and left, right and left.</sentence><sentence id="4212">And Doot-sie (ph) mother was by then, she was an older woman, I mean today its not an older woman if you're in you're late 50's or so.</sentence><sentence id="4213">But she was in a bad shape and she was really very, very skinny and very old looking.</sentence><sentence id="4214">And so she was pushed away together with some other older women and Doot-sie (ph) and I and Betsy were pushed to the right to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4215">And I remember Doot-sie (ph) really went into hysterics and she ran to her mother and they were holding onto her and the guards were just whipping her and pushing her and really separated us.</sentence><sentence id="4216">And they pushed us into the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> and closed the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4217">And Doot-sie (ph) was in complete hysterics because she was really, really always very close to her mother.</sentence><sentence id="4218">Then we went through the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and went back to our</sentence><sentence id="4220">6 <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4221">And I know she cried all night.</sentence><sentence id="4222">But then we found out that the mother was in so-called Shonin's (ph) block where they kept people supposedly that weren't able to work anymore and they were kind of sheltered.</sentence><sentence id="4223">And taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="4224">And she cried and she was very philosophical about it when we saw her.</sentence><sentence id="4225">She says, well, I suppose I'm going out through the <span class="DLF">chimney</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4226">And Doot-sie (ph) went into hysterics and the mother said that she was very, very thirsty.</sentence><sentence id="4227">That the soup that they got was terribly salty and they didn't get any water.</sentence><sentence id="4228">And there was no way we could bring her any water.</sentence><sentence id="4229">I mean, we couldn't carry it in the bowl because they would have seen it and there were no bottles and she said that she really just lost the will to live.</sentence><sentence id="4230">Mainly because she was so terribly thirsty.</sentence><sentence id="4231">And we came the next day again to see her and she was in a worse case even.</sentence><sentence id="4232">And she said that she was just too weak to even walk.</sentence><sentence id="4233">And then I guess that evening they finished them off because we came the next day and, I'm quite sure we saw her at least twice.</sentence><sentence id="4234">And then the next day they were all gone.</sentence><sentence id="4235">The <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was empty.</sentence><sentence id="4236">You see, we could move around after work.</sentence><sentence id="4237">I mean, we sometimes would get a permission to go out and go to the other <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4238">So they were just taken to the gas.</sentence><sentence id="4239">And evidently we were told too by the old timers that the people that they were going to gas, they were fed salty food, very salty soups so that they were so thirsty that they would just going half crazy and they would just as soon go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> than to suffer.</sentence><sentence id="4240">So they just went.</sentence><sentence id="4241">They were not fighting or they were not trying to save themselves.</sentence><sentence id="4242">The faster the better.</sentence><sentence id="4243">So, she was gone.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4283">A: Oh no, Doot-sie (ph) was quite a bit older.</sentence><sentence id="4284">No, she was, I don't remember, in the book it says what year she was born, but Yannick (ph) was born in 1921 and Doot-sie (ph) might have been five years older, five or six years older.</sentence><sentence id="4285">They were the only two children that they had.</sentence><sentence id="4286">But she was quite a bit older.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4290">Q: And when the day of the selection came, did you have any forewarning?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4291">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="4292">Absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="4293">We had no idea of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="4294">And again, it was, they gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="4295">All the selections were taking place in <span class="BUILDING">saunas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4296">And I had no idea whether Doot-sie (ph) was taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> or whether she was just selected out to stay.</sentence><sentence id="4297">But I know that the people that were selected to go, we had to, I think we were bathed again.</sentence><sentence id="4298">I mean, we took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4299">And then got the clothes from the de-lousing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and after that we were kept in a sort of a compound by the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4300">And I think we were allowed to take the blanket.</sentence><sentence id="4301">Because we used the blankets for shawls and for, and the blankets had to go through de-lousing, so I am quite sure that we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> with blankets, because we were not given any when we were there.</sentence><sentence id="4302">Because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> we, it was just bare <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4303">But Betsy and I were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, not on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4317">Q: And when you left were you taken in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> immediately or did you go in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4319">A: No, I think we were loaded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I don't think it was more than an hour or so that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left.</sentence><sentence id="4320">I think they loaded us up and it wasn't like the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4321">You know, that they kept us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we weren't really very squished either.</sentence><sentence id="4322">I mean, it was squishy but we could sort of stretch out.</sentence><sentence id="4323">I mean it wasn't like <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only.</sentence><sentence id="4324">And it was more like they were transporting us to use us for something and not to exterminate us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4331">Q: But you had no idea where you were going?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4333">A: We had no idea where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="4334">And we just knew that we were going away from the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4335">So we were rather hopeful.</sentence><sentence id="4336">We were rather hopeful.</sentence><sentence id="4337">And when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span>, somehow we heard that it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, and Betsy and I were very happy and we were telling everybody what a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4338">That, oh, oh, we are so lucky that we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> because this will be really just a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> compared with</sentence><sentence id="4340">8 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4341">Resort my foot!</sentence><sentence id="4342">It wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4343">By then it was pretty crowded.</sentence><sentence id="4344">It was quite crowded.</sentence><sentence id="4345">And the facilities, I don't know what they did with the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and I don't know what they did with the <span class="INT_SPACE">lavatories</span> and everything else because I just don't remember running water anymore.</sentence><sentence id="4346">And I don't remember latrines.</sentence><sentence id="4347">I think we were using buckets.</sentence><sentence id="4348">Because I just don't remember that there was <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="4349">If there were any they were not in our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4350">And at that time, I was, the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that we were in were not just the Hungarian women.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4351">There were Polish women and from all <span class="NPIP">over</span> and there were Czech women and there were different nationalities.</sentence><sentence id="4352">There were no gypsies as I recall, but our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> had women of all nationalities and I remember the three sisters from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4353">Carmella was the oldest one, and then there were, I don't remember the names of the two others, but one couldn't have been more than thirteen.</sentence><sentence id="4354">She was a skinny little thing and not very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="4355">And then there was the middle sister who was quite nice looking and Carmella was just simply beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="4356">And Carmella was very, very talented and she could draw beautifully and I don't know where she got the paper from, but the whole time, and she had pencil, and the whole time she was drawing and writing poems.</sentence><sentence id="4357">And I don't know whatever happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="4358">Carmella was the first one to die.</sentence><sentence id="4359">And I remember waking up in the morning and hearing the younger sister cried, that Carmel-ka is dead, Carmel-ka is dead!</sentence><sentence id="4360">And they were both sobbing and whining.</sentence><sentence id="4361">And there were many more people that were dead and when they died, we just dragged them <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4362">And at that time there were still the commandos for the dead people and they would tie straps to the wrists and to their feet and they would drag them.</sentence><sentence id="4363">Two people would drag each cadaver to the <span class="DLF">ditch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4364">And then, three days later the middle sister died.</sentence><sentence id="4365">And then the little one died probably a week later.</sentence><sentence id="4366">And I remember waking up in the morning and seeing the little one on all fours, sort of scrunched up and I think she went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, just being scrunched up like that.</sentence><sentence id="4367">And she was dead.</sentence><sentence id="4368">And we dragged her out.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4372">Q: Was it typhus?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4373">A: Typhus.</sentence><sentence id="4374">Now the little one died of typhus and Carmella I think died of typhus and the edema.</sentence><sentence id="4375">And the middle one died, she wasn't swollen.</sentence><sentence id="4376">The two younger ones weren't but Carmella was.</sentence><sentence id="4377">And then I remember this one woman, we woke up in the morning and she was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunk</span> and she was so swollen that she looked Japanese.</sentence><sentence id="4378">Her eyes were just slits in her face and it just was, this was something that was really amazing.</sentence><sentence id="4379">That it's really not, I came across a medical report book in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in polish, and I tried to find that syndrome and I don't think it was ever really described.</sentence><sentence id="4380">So I don't know, I didn't really research it very much but I would like to spend some time in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and see what, if they have anything of that sort described.</sentence><sentence id="4381">But it was just amazing that, if you woke up with you're eyes swelling you were dead in less than three days.</sentence><sentence id="4382">And as I understand just a good dose of dietetic probably would have cured everybody.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4393">Q: When was it that you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4395">A: We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> after New Years, that was 1945.</sentence><sentence id="4396">I think it was January 1st because it seems to me that when they were toasting and screaming and yelling it was New Years" and I think that we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> the next day.</sentence><sentence id="4397">Sometime late in the evening, late in the afternoon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4401">Q: Did you work at all while you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4403">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="4404">We didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="4405">We didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="4406">We just sat there and we still had our bowls.</sentence><sentence id="4407">The bowls were more precious than gold because if you didn't have a bowl you did not, you couldn't hold soup in you're hands.</sentence><sentence id="4408">Maybe I, no, I don't remember whether I, I think I wanted to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4409">Because you could steal a potato.</sentence><sentence id="4410">It seems to me that maybe I did because I remember eating raw potatoes because we had no way of cooking them.</sentence><sentence id="4411">But I remember that I was surprised, I had never ate a raw potato before, that it tasted a little bit like an apple without the apple taste,</sentence><sentence id="4413">0 except the texture was more like an apple.</sentence><sentence id="4414">But, maybe I did.</sentence><sentence id="4415">But I just don't really remember.</sentence><sentence id="4416">The whole time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> is just one big fog.</sentence><sentence id="4417">And one thing happened and it was like a miracle because I was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I looked up and there was Mrs. Gi-gen-ska (ph).</sentence><sentence id="4418">I saw Mrs. Gi-gen-ska (ph) and I thought I died.</sentence><sentence id="4419">And I was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4420">I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="4421">And she didn't have her hair shaved or anything and she was with her cane, she was limping because she had something wrong with her leg.</sentence><sentence id="4422">And she had her cane and she recognized me.</sentence><sentence id="4423">Actually I recognized her because she looked just like she did.</sentence><sentence id="4424">She was blonde and she had sort of wavy hair and she had her nice clothes on.</sentence><sentence id="4425">Not the rags that we had.</sentence><sentence id="4426">And I looked at her and I called her and she recognized me of sorts.</sentence><sentence id="4427">She couldn't believe that Anya (ph), Anya (ph) was my name, and we hugged and we kissed and I wanted to know what she was doing there.</sentence><sentence id="4428">And she was in a different part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> but she just happened to be in that common <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4429">You see, we were not standing up <span class="DLF">hill</span> anymore, we were not counted.</sentence><sentence id="4430">We just kind of existed.</sentence><sentence id="4431">And she was in a very good shape.</sentence><sentence id="4432">And you know that except hugging with her and kissing her, I had no recollection anymore of what happened.</sentence><sentence id="4433">And I don't think I saw her again.</sentence><sentence id="4434">And not until three years ago when Rena Chic-kin- ska (ph), her daughter, got my address.</sentence><sentence id="4435">Well actually no, she didn't get my address.</sentence><sentence id="4436">Ches-ruf (ph) wrote to Chin-ut-sa's (ph) wife, I introduced them and they were boyfriend and girlfriend at some time, and Ches-ruf (ph) send me Rena's letter.</sentence><sentence id="4437">Just like the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> does.</sentence><sentence id="4438">If you write to the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> and you want an address of you're cousin somewhere, they won't do it.</sentence><sentence id="4439">You give them the letter that you want you're cousin to get and then they send it to you're cousin, and then the cousin decides whether he wants to correspond with you or not.</sentence><sentence id="4440">So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ches-ruf</span> (ph) decided the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="4441">He send me Rena's letter and he said that Rena said that she knew me from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she wanted to get in touch with me.</sentence><sentence id="4442">One of the reasons that she wanted to get in touch, she knew that I was alive, at least that I was alive in 1945 because her mother saw me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4443">You see, I</sentence><sentence id="4445">1 couldn't even remember whether I saw her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or I saw her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4446">But Rena wrote that I saw her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and what Rena wanted was, she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they were not Jewish but she married a Jewish man after the war, a writer.</sentence><sentence id="4447">A play writer and a play critic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4448">That's another story, but anyway she went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and she witnessed the Ad-va-shem (ph) ceremony for the Righteous.</sentence><sentence id="4449">And she thought that maybe her mother was dead already, she died of a heart attack in I think 1983 or 1982.</sentence><sentence id="4450">And she thought that her mother was helping a lot of Jews and among them she was helping my family.</sentence><sentence id="4451">That maybe I could write a testimonial and see whether they could get a medal for her.</sentence><sentence id="4452">And so I wrote back to Rena and I wanted to know more about her mother and she said that it was Bergen-Belsen.</sentence><sentence id="4453">That what happened was her mother was helping a lot of people and one of them was smuggling weapons to the resistance or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="4454">And they caught her finally.</sentence><sentence id="4455">Just before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was to be evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="4456">And they sent her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived, they decided they didn't need any more prisoners in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they sent her off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4457">And she was just plain lucky because if she arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> three weeks earlier or so she would have been put straight into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> with her limping leg.</sentence><sentence id="4458">And this way she had, even she had her cane with her, they didn't take it away from her.</sentence><sentence id="4459">And she had still her normal clothes and she was never tattooed because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived, as Rena said, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and then her mother was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4460">And she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> until, that I got all from Rena, until October because she did have typhus too.</sentence><sentence id="4461">And so she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and then she was sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4462">So

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4623">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4624">And actually that probably somewhat might have saved my life.</sentence><sentence id="4625">Because when the

remember crawling on my hands and knees because my legs were so swollen, it wasn't just my ankles but I think they were swollen all the way to my knees.</sentence><sentence id="4628">And my hands were swollen.</sentence><sentence id="4629">But somehow my eyes and my face weren't as bad.</sentence><sentence id="4630">And I remember I barely could walk.</sentence><sentence id="4631">And there were two or three steps into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4632">I think the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were not on a foundation, but on

id="4635">Because I started, that that saved my life, that I did have typhus, because I had no appetite.</sentence><sentence id="4636">I know that I hadn't eaten anything for several days.</sentence><sentence id="4637">I know I was very thirsty and I just don't remember that there was water available.</sentence><sentence id="4638">I know people can't live without water, but I just don't remember having any water to drink.</sentence><sentence id="4639">And we knew that something was going on because we could hear shooting, and heavy shooting.</sentence><sentence id="4640">And it seemed to me like there were air raids all the time because the sirens were going.</sentence><sentence id="4641">And the guards seemed to be sort of not</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="4645">5 paying much attention to us and we didn't get any food.</sentence><sentence id="4646">And I don't remember how long it was that we didn't get any food.</sentence><sentence id="4647">And then when we woke up in the morning there were no guards.</sentence><sentence id="4648">And I remember crawling out and seeing people running towards the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and the <span

<span class="BUILDING">towers</span> there were no guards, anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4653">And we couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="4654">And then the first <span

berets.</sentence><sentence id="4657">And they had kind of greenish uniforms, not the blue-green but the yellow-green.</sentence><sentence id="4658">They had jackets.</sentence><sentence id="4659">I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="4660">I don't think that I could believe either.</sentence><sentence id="4661">I forgot to tell you what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> looked like by then.</sentence><sentence id="4662">First of all, there were dead people all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4663">And there was, I don't want to use the bad word, but there was shit all over because everybody had diarrhea or there was no, they couldn't get to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> and they just did it where ever they stood.</sentence><sentence id="4664">And you couldn't even walk.</sentence><sentence id="4665">And there was, I don't know whether it is recorded or not, but there was cannibalism going on.</sentence><sentence id="4666">I remember.</sentence><sentence id="4667">It was before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4668">For several days when we didn't get any food or anything and I saw people with their stomachs open and they were eating liver.</sentence><sentence id="4669">I saw it.</sentence><sentence id="4670">Robert likes

before I. . .</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4674">[Tape partially erased here]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4675">A: People were dying all over and they were just cadavers all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4676">And I probably should say dead people.</sentence><sentence id="4677">And they, the Germans, that was before the Germans escaped.</sentence><sentence id="4678">They were making us, I didn't because I couldn't walk, but whoever could, say they dragged them.</sentence><sentence id="4679">They dragged them to the <span class="DLF">ditches</span>, but they didn't have enough help.</sentence><sentence id="4680">They didn't have enough help to clean everything</sentence><sentence id="4682">6 so when the British came, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was just absolutely covered with dead people.</sentence><sentence id="4683">Just piles of them.</sentence><sentence id="4684">Some of them were piled up and some of them were just scattered around, everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4685">And people just defecating and relieving themselves right where they stood.</sentence><sentence id="4686">It was just horrible.</sentence><sentence id="4687">And, and before that, there was this one time, a few weeks before that, when they drowned a girl in a bucket of soup.</sentence><sentence id="4688">You know, they would bring the, that was when they were still cooking for us.</sentence><sentence id="4689">The soup was turnips or potatoes or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="4690">And they brought it in and people were so hungry that they were storming at it and pushing and pulling and one of the women leaned over and they pushed her, just right into the bucket of soup.</sentence><sentence

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4715">Q: You described seeing the soldiers coming.</sentence><sentence id="4716">You knew they weren't German.</sentence><sentence id="4717">Did you know that they were British?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4721">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="4722">We knew that they, because I said that they looked different.</sentence><sentence id="4723">I don't remember the markings on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> or anything, or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, but they had different uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="4724">They had round sort of caps and they had jackets.</sentence><sentence id="4725">And they drove into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and people who could walk or run just swarmed them the guys really had to protect themselves.</sentence><sentence id="4726">They had cigarettes and they had chocolate bars and they were throwing them and people were killing themselves for that, and so they stopped because people were just killing each other to get hold of the chocolate.</sentence><sentence id="4727">And I just don't remember what happened exactly, but it seems to me that more and more of them came and somehow the people that were well enough, more of the newcomers, like Mrs. Chi-chin-ska (ph) was one of the newcomers, I think those were trying to put some kind of an order into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and put us back into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> until more soldiers came in so that they could somehow control the crowds.</sentence><sentence id="4728">And the first thing that they did, they opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they cooked this food.</sentence><sentence id="4729">They brought out big barrels of the food that they cooked and it</sentence><sentence id="4731">7 was some kind of British rations that were just a fantastic stew with big chunks of salt, pork or whatever, it was fat.</sentence><sentence id="4732">And it was just absolutely smelling deliciously and people just went crazy and they really had to push them around to be able to ration this stuff out.</sentence><sentence id="4733">And I remember getting a bow!</sentence><sentence id="4734">of it and eating it with my fingers and I think I took one mouthful and I couldn't swallow it.</sentence><sentence id="4735">I just couldn't eat anything.</sentence><sentence id="4736">I just got sick to my stomach and I just left the bowl there and I just didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="4737">I remember crawling back into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and Betsy couldn't eat either.</sentence><sentence id="4738">Betsy also had typhus and she, we both cried because we were so hungry and we just wanted water.</sentence><sentence id="4739">There was plenty of water to drink too.</sentence><sentence id="4740">They had cups and we could drink.</sentence><sentence id="4741">But we couldn't eat.</sentence><sentence id="4742">But there were a lot of people who were just gorging themselves with that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="4743">And they were all dead the next day.</sentence><sentence id="4744">They all got diarrhea and that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was really then horrible.</sentence><sentence id="4745">Because they had diarrhea in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, they had diarrhea everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="4746">And evidently they couldn't eat that kind of food and that caused the diarrhea.</sentence><sentence id="4747">And people were just sick all over.</sentence><sentence id="4748">They were throwing up and that was probably worse than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="4749">And by then, it seems to me like the medical Corp arrived.</sentence><sentence id="4750">And they cooked up big drums of watery cereal, sort of a cream of wheat or something, but it mostly looked like watery stuff.</sentence><sentence id="4751">And they gave us that to eat and I remember | ate that, I think it was more like drinking.</sentence><sentence id="4752">I drank about two cups of it, but a lot of us thought that that wasn't food really and we were explained that our stomachs were not use to the rich food and we had to slowly get adjusted.</sentence><sentence id="4753">I remember the next portion was a little bit thicker until we finally got gruel, which is the normal thickness, but for at least three days.</sentence><sentence id="4754">And then also there was bread in <span class="INT_SPACE">storage</span> but we didn't get it.</sentence><sentence id="4755">I mean, the Germans would not give us the bread but the British finally opened the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and they found there was plenty of bread, which they never distributed.</sentence><sentence id="4756">So we did get bread.</sentence><sentence id="4757">And more and more British came and they started cleaning up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4758">But the main thing was that the Germans could not, a lot of them did not escape.</sentence><sentence id="4759">And they hid in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the Commander, Kramer, I</sentence><sentence id="4761">8 think was his name, he was caught.</sentence><sentence id="4762">And the woman, I forget her name, the German woman, the main woman that was taking care of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span>, she was caught too.</sentence><sentence id="4763">And many others.</sentence><sentence id="4764">But Kramer was the one and the woman was the other one that we were all cheering, that they got caught.</sentence><sentence id="4765">And then what the British did that I never forget either, they had the German soldiers pile the corpses up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they had Kramer take his shirt off and lay naked at the top of the corpses.</sentence><sentence id="4766">And drive, they drove to the big <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and buried the people.</sentence><sentence id="4767">And I know that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were going back and forth, and back and forth, with all the dead people.</sentence><sentence id="4768">I don't know, I heard the figure that there were like 30,000 or so that were dead.</sentence><sentence id="4769">And then they were cleaning up the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and cleaning up the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4770">And then I have a vague recollection of what was going on, but I know that they had a scale and I guess the British doctors, they were weighing us and taking photographs.</sentence><sentence id="4771">And I remember I weighed 71 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="4772">I didn't know what pounds were, I just knew kilograms, but they were weighing us in pounds.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4828">A: 5'L".</sentence><sentence id="4829">And, oh, but I know we got food.</sentence><sentence id="4830">That after a while we got bread and we got still a kind of not very thick soup and not much meat, but evidently very nutritious food because it seems to me like I gained weight, maybe five pounds in the first months or so.</sentence><sentence id="4831">That was April 14, 1945 when the <span class="DLF">gate</span> opened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4836">Q: Had you recovered from typhus at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4880">A: Well when we were liberated, she was still sick and she was getting worse.</sentence><sentence id="4881">She couldn't eat anything and they opened the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4882">I mean, the British opened the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and so that's where she went and I would go and visit her.</sentence><sentence id="4883">But then she recovered from typhus but she evidently had tuberculosis and so she was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> the rest of the time.</sentence><sentence id="4884">Until I left.</sentence><sentence id="4885">So I just went to visit her and I just don't know what happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="4886">I searched in the books and the only thing that I found was a record of us being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> the first time.</sentence><sentence id="4887">But under the column of diseased, there was just blanks.</sentence><sentence id="4888">So I haven't, and then I searched other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">books</span> and I have not found her name anywhere else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4898">Q: Will you describe you're memories of the British.</sentence><sentence id="4899">Did you have any particular recollections of relations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4902">A: Not a lot because, first of all, we were absolutely overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="4903">I mean we just couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="4904">It took a while to sort of sink into our brains that we didn't have to be up in the morning for a roll call, that we didn't have to be scared, that we were going to get food, that we were alive.</sentence><sentence id="4905">That</sentence><sentence id="4907">00 maybe even we had a future.</sentence><sentence id="4908">And everybody was absolutely just wonderful to us.</sentence><sentence id="4909">They had tons of chocolate and cigarettes and they just, they were all for, I mean cigarettes and chocolates and anything else was just for the asking.</sentence><sentence id="4910">And they took a lot of photographs and I remember that they did weigh me and photograph me, just on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4911">It was nothing official.</sentence><sentence id="4912">And I was about 70 or 71 pounds, I was really skinny.</sentence><sentence id="4913">And still in the horrible clothing because they didn't have anything else to give us.</sentence><sentence id="4914">And I think we eventually got some better clothing and I don't know whether they brought them in from some <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> or wherever, but I know that I did not wear the dress that I came in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, when my cousin took me.</sentence><sentence id="4915">So it seems to me that at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> I, see things went so fast and there is a one big blank of sorts, of the detailed day by day activities, but I know that one thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="4916">And it was shortly after the liberation when I was feeling better.</sentence><sentence id="4917">It might have been maybe two weeks later, maybe more, that I joined an excursion into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4918">And a lot of people were going into the adjoining <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and bringing food and clothing and it seems to me that that's where I got the dress that I was wearing later on.</sentence><sentence id="4919">And I remember going into one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4920">They were all abandoned, there were no, these were all <span class="BUILDING">German house</span>, and it looked like people left in a great hurry.</sentence><sentence id="4921">And I remember going into one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and there was silverware and a Lika camera and I always was very fond of Lika cameras, I had one and I had to leave it behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> when we were deported.</sentence><sentence id="4922">So I was just thrilled with the Lika camera.</sentence><sentence id="4923">I don't know what I was going to do with it, but somebody found a pillow case and we started to put the things, you know there were some table cloths and napkins and silverware and the Lika camera, and so we were putting those things in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow cases</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4924">And then somebody went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> or the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and called us.</sentence><sentence id="4925">And there were about four women, there were four of us at that time, and so we went down.</sentence><sentence id="4926">And there were sausages and hams and a side of pork, I mean, there was food that we haven't seen for ages and it was just hanging from <span class="DLF">rafters</span> and I think that's they way</sentence><sentence id="4928">01 usually food was preserved.</sentence><sentence id="4929">It was all smoked and preserved and then just hanging dry.</sentence><sentence id="4930">Out went the silver and the Lika and everything else, out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow cases</span>, and we loaded it all up with as much food as we could carry, and we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we shared it with other people.</sentence><sentence id="4931">At that time we could already eat normal food.</sentence><sentence id="4932">And we still were hungry all the time even though we could get as much food as we wanted.</sentence><sentence id="4933">It seems to me that the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> were going day and night.</sentence><sentence id="4934">And we did not have to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4935">They set up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> in sort of cafeteria style and we sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and ate.</sentence><sentence id="4936">And it was just such a change that it was extremely difficult for us to grasp it and to really know that it is all for real.</sentence><sentence id="4937">Every time I thought, well, you know, we were dreaming about being free and going out and doing things.</sentence><sentence id="4938">And I thought I was still dreaming.</sentence><sentence id="4939">And we were just living in a completely unreal world.</sentence><sentence id="4940">And then one day, I met a young soldier, British soldier.</sentence><sentence id="4941">And he was very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="4942">He spoke a little bit German and I didn't speak much English, but he was very friendly and we were not suppose to fraternize, or they weren't suppose to fraternize with the prisoners, so we were just holding hands and going for a walk.</sentence><sentence id="4943">And then he said that, he was a driver for one of the officers, for an older man.</sentence><sentence id="4944">And somehow I met his superior and he found out that I could speak several languages and he talked to me and he said, he has a job for me.</sentence><sentence id="4945">I should go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and also in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, or the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> next to it, again I don't, these were all <span class="INT_SPACE">officer's quarters</span> that the Germans lived in, and of course they were all abandoned.</sentence><sentence id="4946">He told me to go and he wrote it on a piece of papers to whom I should ask for, and I went there and they interviewed me.</sentence><sentence id="4947">And they thought that I would be just perfect for working in a <span class="INT_SPACE">records room</span>, answering questions to people who are coming in looking for relatives and looking for other people.</sentence><sentence id="4948">So I thought this would be kind of neat.</sentence><sentence id="4949">And maybe that's when they gave me a different dress and I just don't quite remember.</sentence><sentence id="4950">But, oh, something else happened before that phase.</sentence><sentence id="4951">I went on another excursion into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we went very early in the morning, it was still very dark.</sentence><sentence id="4952">And we got</sentence><sentence id="4954">02 there and the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we came to was locked up so we couldn't get in.</sentence><sentence id="4955">So we went around looking for a way to get in and I know it was not proper to do it, but at that point we didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="4956">We just wanted things and we wanted to, I don't know why, well, it wasn't called stealing, it was called organizing.</sentence><sentence id="4957">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that was the word I learned, that it wasn't stealing, you just organized to get things and to just have things.</sentence><sentence id="4958">So we went around and I heard, see I lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> before I was arrested, and I heard sort of a familiar sound, birds or something, so I was with two other women.</sentence><sentence id="4959">And we followed the sound and there was a <span class="DLF">coop</span> with a goose inside.</sentence><sentence id="4960">A big, fat goose.</sentence><sentence id="4961">Well, that was more than we could bear.</sentence><sentence id="4962">I mean, that was the most beautiful sight.</sentence><sentence id="4963">And I stuck my hand in and the goose bit my finger, you know they snap.</sentence><sentence id="4964">And I grabbed her by the neck and I could pull her out, I mean she was fighting me.</sentence><sentence id="4965">It was a female goose I think because we found eggs inside, I mean inside the goose, because I had my little knife, I told you about the knife that I had.</sentence><sentence id="4966">I did an awful thing.</sentence><sentence id="4967">I cut the goose's head off with the little knife and it took a while.[Laughing].</sentence><sentence id="4968">It was awful.</sentence><sentence id="4969">But, I mean, having seen all the blood and all the dead bodies, I mean just cutting a goose head was not that bad, I think.</sentence><sentence id="4970">But today I think it was awful and I don't know whether I should laugh or cry, but we pulled the goose out and we threw the head back in.</sentence><sentence id="4971">And we were walking back dragging the goose and then we were thinking what will happen if the people come back and they will just find the head.</sentence><sentence id="4972">Maybe they wanted to have the goose and the other girls were saying, forget it.</sentence><sentence id="4973">Nobody was worried about you.</sentence><sentence id="4974">We have the goose and we sat in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and we plucked the feathers.</sentence><sentence id="4975">It took about an hour and the down and the feathers were flying all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4976">And then we took the goose back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4977">That was before the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> were all set up properly and before we were getting the food in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> style.</sentence><sentence id="4978">We still were cooking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the little sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> and in our bowls.</sentence><sentence id="4979">I mean, not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> but on an open fire.</sentence><sentence id="4980">Anyway, I don't think I ate the goose.</sentence><sentence id="4981">I don't think I could eat it, but everybody was gorging</sentence><sentence id="4983">03 themselves.</sentence><sentence id="4984">I think they barbecued of sorts because they baked it on the, they cut it up and they baked it on top of the fire, and I know I couldn't eat it.</sentence><sentence id="4985">But to this day, I can't forget killing that poor goose.</sentence><sentence id="4986">So anyway, so that was before.</sentence><sentence id="4987">And then I went to get the job and they told me it was all right so I, they told me I will not be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="4988">I mean, stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> anymore but I will have my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a real <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4989">And they told me where the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> will be so I went upstairs and sure enough there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, but there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheets</span> and no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blankets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4990">And I thought, well, I suppose maybe they will give me something.</sentence><sentence id="4991">So then I found out that there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">supply room</span> downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="4992">I don't know whether I should tell you this story because I told it to my children and they said, well, you have to tell. [</sentence><sentence id="4993">rest of following sentence accidentally deleted from testimony] study.</sentence><sentence id="4994">So, I could read English much better than I could speak.</sentence><sentence id="4995">And, you see I didn't know the pronunciation, so I went downstairs and I tried to tell them that I need some bedding.</sentence><sentence id="4996">But they couldn't understand what I wanted and I said, "two shits for my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> - two shits".</sentence><sentence id="4997">They almost died!</sentence><sentence id="4998">Oh, they kept on asking me and they were just laughing and I kept on repeating and they were laughing some more.</sentence><sentence id="4999">Well, finally they knew what was going on, that the pronunciation was, you know?</sentence><sentence id="5000">Sheet or shit or whatever, it's all the same to me.</sentence><sentence id="5001">Well anyway, they gave me the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedding</span> and that was the first time in over a year I slept in a real <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5002">With a blanket.</sentence><sentence id="5003">Covered with a blanket cover and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheet</span> and a white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheet</span>, washed, clean, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillowcase</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5004">And I couldn't sleep.</sentence><sentence id="5005">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> was not like I was use to, but still it was not the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5006">It was maybe a straw or maybe a thin blanket, and this is something I don't think I will ever forget.</sentence><sentence id="5007">So this was my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5008">And it seems to me that I got some underwear and I got some, a change of clothes because I know they wanted me to be dressed up.</sentence><sentence id="5009">And I had a badge with my name on it.</sentence><sentence id="5010">I think they took my photograph too.</sentence><sentence id="5011">So I worked there and many people were coming and asking for relatives and, you know, people were wandering and wandering and</sentence><sentence id="5013">04 wandering from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and, I don't know, but there were a lot of people coming.</sentence><sentence id="5014">Even from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5015">People were coming that were separated when they arrived and they wanted to know.</sentence><sentence id="5016">So I was busy.</sentence><sentence id="5017">I was mainly sitting there looking through the files and, I don't know, somebody else was preparing the files.</sentence><sentence id="5018">And I was still kind of seeing this young man who decided he was in love with me and he wants to marry me.</sentence><sentence id="5019">Well, there was no such thing.</sentence><sentence id="5020">There was no fraternization and you could not marry anybody.</sentence><sentence id="5021">And so he talked to his boss and what was happening too is that the officer, I don't know whether he was a General or somebody who was in charge of that particular division and the young man was his driver.</sentence><sentence id="5022">As a matter of fact, I still have his photograph.</sentence><sentence id="5023">I didn't bring it with me but there it is, "To my beloved Anna".</sentence><sentence id="5024">And he said, so the older man, the British officer, wanted to know whether he could take, really get me out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5025">Well there was no way he could.</sentence><sentence id="5026">And he had a daughter about my age and he just couldn't see leaving me there.</sentence><sentence id="5027">So he said, now do you have any relatives?</sentence><sentence id="5028">No, I don't have anybody.</sentence><sentence id="5029">Not that I know of.</sentence><sentence id="5030">And he said, well, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but maybe you have somebody in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5031">I said, oh yes, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5032">I have an Uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5033">Well they sent us, one time they sent us a package from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, when we were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5034">Where in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5035"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5036">Where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5037">What do you mean, where in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5038">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>!</sentence><sentence id="5039">I didn't know that, my geography, American geography wasn't very good.</sentence><sentence id="5040">I didn't know there was <span class="REGION">New York State</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> that is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>, and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="5041">He says, Okay, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5042">Well the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> was there already and they, he gave all the information to the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5043">This, Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5044">So the Red Cross got the information and they, I don't know whether they cabled to my Uncle or whether they wrote a letter, [have no idea.</sentence><sentence id="5045">But my Uncle was notified that Anna Fayno claims to be his niece.</sentence><sentence id="5046">No, also, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the way they found Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was they looked in the Brooklyn telephone book, that's where all the Jews lived.</sentence><sentence id="5047">And there was no Aaron Chil-o-vitch</sentence><sentence id="5049">05 (ph).</sentence><sentence id="5050">So the next thing is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5051">And there was Aaron Chil-o-vitch (ph), the only Aaron Chil- o-vitch (ph), its not the very usual name in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5052">On <span class="DLF">Wall Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5053">So they got in touch with him, that Anna Fayno is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and she says she is you're niece.</sentence><sentence id="5054">And he said, I don't know any Anna Fanyo.</sentence><sentence id="5055">And then he decided, talking to my Aunt, that I did get married.</sentence><sentence id="5056">They remembered because they had a daughter the same age.</sentence><sentence id="5057">And they remembered that their daughter got married at nineteen and I got married at nineteen.</sentence><sentence id="5058">So they decided that maybe this is my married name.</sentence><sentence id="5059">And my cousin, their son, was in the American army.</sentence><sentence id="5060">And he was sent, he was suppose to, I mean, everything is fate, you know?</sentence><sentence id="5061">He was also speaking several languages and he was a very good linguist and he had put him in a <span class="BUILDING">Japanese school</span> to learn Japanese and he was suppose to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5062">And somebody came down with measles in his division so they quarantined them.</sentence><sentence id="5063">And by the time they, it was time for them to go, the other division left and these people stayed, so they decided they will send him to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after all.</sentence><sentence id="5064">And one of his jobs was to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> to look for the SS men and the guards and the commandants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> who were hidden among the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="5065">And he, that was his job, and he was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5066">And so my Uncle cabled to him, for at that time there was no <span class="BUILDING">telex</span>, but anyway, he said there is an Anna Fayno in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, check it out.</sentence><sentence id="5067">Maybe that's Neur-rev (ph) because that's my Russian name, Anna is Neur-rev (ph).</sentence><sentence id="5068">So he got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and a driver and they proceeded to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5069">And they arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> and he wanted to know whether anybody knew Anna Fayno and nobody knew Anna Fayno.</sentence><sentence id="5070">And finally they told him to go to the file with the dead people because we do keep a file on all the people that died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there were many of them that died after the liberation, so maybe you can find her there.</sentence><sentence id="5071">So, he went to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he walks in and he walks up to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and he says, in Polish, he started to say, to ask about Anna Fayno, and he grabbed me and started to kiss me and everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> knew that, you know,</sentence><sentence id="5073">06 there was some hanky panky going on, but you know?</sentence><sentence id="5074">In the dark of the evening or something, but not in the middle of the day, in the middle of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5075">So, he cried and I cried, I immediately recognized him too in spite of the uniform, and he recognized me.</sentence><sentence id="5076">Even though my hair was not the same and my face was not the same, but he did recognize me.</sentence><sentence id="5077">So everybody started jumping around and crying and laughing and, anyway, I think he got more marriage proposals that day than he ever did, except that he had a big band on his hand, he was married already.</sentence><sentence id="5078">But he didn't even stay over night there.</sentence><sentence id="5079">He put me on the, I mean he just signed some papers and got released and he put me on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and he says, "what is this?"</sentence><sentence id="5080">Well I had a bundle with me and these were the two British blankets from my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5081">They were beautiful, soft wool and I wasn't going to leave them there.</sentence><sentence id="5082">So, and a couple of my treasures including the little knife.</sentence><sentence id="5083">So anyway, I wouldn't part with the stuff so he said, "All right, let's go."</sentence><sentence id="5084">And we drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

the war, but I didn't have the details really, but she was not imprisoned during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> and she said that there has been a law passed that all the former inmates and survivors and so on can get restitution.</sentence><sentence id="6188">And it was suppose to be a lump sum depending on the condition, the health condition of the person, there would be a pension.</sentence><sentence id="6189">So I really didn't know much about it and I started to investigate and, as a matter of fact, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> on a visit, with my second husband, and we visited the Ga-loose-es (ph).</sentence><sentence id="6190">Now the old people, no actually, it was the lady that died, but Mr. Ga-loose (ph) was still alive and his son was a doctor and the daughter was married to a German lawyer who was specializing in the restitutions and he was German, he was not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="6191">And he gave me a name of a lawyer that I should contact that would be helpful.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6192">And I contacted him, his name was Mr. Collinger (ph) and we were corresponding back and forth.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6193">And there is a stack of literature on the subject because, as Mr. Collinger (ph) explained, it wasn't his demands for all kinds of proofs and dates and so on, but it was the German government that was</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6196">24 very thorough because anybody could claim and they only had so much money to distribute.</sentence><sentence id="6197">So I spent quite a bit of time writing letters and then getting an answer from him and asking for even more answers and it was many, many years of corresponding back and forth until finally I got a request that I be examined by a German doctor.</sentence><sentence id="6198">And that was already after my second husband died so it was after 1977, because I remember my son drove with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6199">We had an appointment.</sentence><sentence id="6200">And evidently that doctor, that's all he was doing is examining people, or I don't know, it was very, very strange.</sentence><sentence id="6201">The <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was very old fashioned in some big <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6202">And I felt very, very uneasy because he was quite rude and he also was not very gentle.</sentence><sentence id="6203">He again gave me a gynecological examination and he poked me all over and it was a very bad experience.</sentence><sentence id="6204">And I know that I felt very bad.</sentence><sentence id="6205">My son was there, I mean, waiting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> and he didn't know why I came out crying, but I just, I mean, the whole business of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and everything else just came back to me so vividly that I thought, I'm just going to forget the whole thing and I'm not going to go through with it.</sentence><sentence id="6206">But I did.</sentence><sentence id="6207">Then, the next thing they demanded that I be examined by a psychiatrist, also a German man.</sentence><sentence id="6208">And so that was another trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6209">And that lasted most of the day, because first I was given a whole stack of questionnaires to fill out and I think these were the standard sort of questions.</sentence><sentence id="6210">Do I feel that I'm being followed?</sentence><sentence id="6211">Do I have nightmares?</sentence><sentence id="6212">Do I have delusions?</sentence><sentence id="6213">Anyway, these were things that, some of them were quite obvious what I'm suppose to answer if I want to get my restitution.</sentence><sentence id="6214">But anyway, I answered to the best of my ability.</sentence><sentence id="6215">I didn't have to do much lying because I didn't feel that I am being followed, but I certainly was always aware of what was going on around me.</sentence><sentence id="6216">And also I did have nightmares and I, sometimes I didn't feel very good.</sentence><sentence id="6217">There was one incident years and years later, as a matter of fact, it was about six years ago.</sentence><sentence id="6218">When we came back from Europe, we landed, usually we land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span>, but that particular time we took the Pan Am, I think the last year Pan Am was in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6221">25 business, and we landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6222">And we had to go through customs.</sentence><sentence id="6223">And the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was Kennedy's.</sentence><sentence id="6224">But it was so crowded and we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and then we had to go through all these different <span class="DLF">corridors</span> and at one point I got separated from Robert and I started to scream.</sentence><sentence id="6225">Because people were pushing from all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> and I just couldn't breath.</sentence><sentence id="6226">And I leaned against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and I started to scream.</sentence><sentence id="6227">And the guard or the stewardess or whoever it was came to me and she wanted to know what was wrong and I couldn't breath, I couldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="6228">I was just absolutely petrified.</sentence><sentence id="6229">I mean, that just felt like I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> with all the people pushing and pulling and, it was absolutely horrible.</sentence><sentence id="6230">And I think Robert finally somehow found me and we went, he pushed me around and we went into the larger <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> out of the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> into the main <span class="REGION">area</span> where we could stand in <span class="DLF">lines</span> waiting for the customs to go through with us, and the passport control, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="6231">But I have incidents like that all through my life, really.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6232">End of Tape 7.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6235">26 Tape 8</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6236">Q: And, you were saying?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6237">A: So I really cannot stand certain situations.</sentence><sentence id="6238">And I don't like crowds.</sentence><sentence id="6239">I don't like loud noises.</sentence><sentence id="6240">I can't stand anybody screaming at me.</sentence><sentence id="6241">I cannot, I just lose my mind.</sentence><sentence id="6242">I just can't communicate and I have to really try to compose and get a hold of myself.</sentence><sentence id="6243">And I try to avoid situations like that.</sentence><sentence id="6244">And I cannot stand smell of burning gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="6245">When we drive in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, Robert likes fresh air intake and I want it shut up because he cannot smell the gas and I just, I just don't want any fresh air in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="6246">So some of the <span class="NPIP">things</span> kind of stay with me, but I try to smile, I try to show my happy face most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="6247">But there are times when I get these attacks of fear, of panic, and sometimes it is very difficult for me.</sentence><sentence id="6248">But most of the time, I can cope.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6261">Q: Have you found that you think over the years a lot about you're experiences?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6263">A: I can't say that I think a lot, but there may be things like certain incidences that will remind me of things and I, we are making those pilgrimages now to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and each time I go I hope that I will find something.</sentence><sentence id="6264">And I know I want, I went through the records here, I mean, that was one of the purposes of the trip, was not just to have the interview but to go through the records.</sentence><sentence id="6265">But I realize that the records I am looking for, they wouldn't be here.</sentence><sentence id="6266">I mean, there is no reason for them to be here because they are not complete and, as I said, the answers I am seeking, first it is probably too late.</sentence><sentence id="6267">You know, in the span of time.</sentence><sentence id="6268">I mean, people are in their 70's and sometimes they don't live that long.</sentence><sentence id="6269">Normally.</sentence><sentence id="6270">So I may be looking for people who just passed away, the normal way.</sentence><sentence id="6271">Like for example, when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> this last summer, Yesh-ir Mos-tof-ski (ph) was in perfect health we thought.</sentence><sentence id="6272">And he was.</sentence><sentence id="6273">And we had a nice visit.</sentence><sentence id="6274">My daughters, two of my daughters, met both brothers and we had tea and it was just very lovely.</sentence><sentence id="6275">And three days later I found out that Yesh- ir (ph) just died from a heart attack, and sat down to paint one of his painting and asked his</sentence><sentence id="6277">27 housekeeper to bring him a cup of tea and when she returned with the cup of tea he was stretched out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, gone.</sentence><sentence id="6278">So I know I am searching and probably the thing that I think most often about is my little sister.</sentence><sentence id="6279">And I watched Schindler's List, the movie in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, we seldom go to movies.</sentence><sentence id="6280">We usually rent laser discs and watch them at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but we went to the movie and we watched it.</sentence><sentence id="6281">And I think the scene with that little girl, I just couldn't take it.</sentence><sentence id="6282">I really thought I would start screaming right in the middle of the movie.</sentence><sentence id="6283">And I was holding Robert's hand and trying to just say, it is a movie.</sentence><sentence id="6284">It seemed so real to me that she was about the age of my sister.</sentence><sentence id="6285">And I just thought that what I was seeing on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">movie</span>, what I was seeing in the film, really was happening.</sentence><sentence id="6286">And that maybe my sister is somewhere there.</sentence><sentence id="6287">And things like that happen to me all the time.</sentence><sentence id="6288">I don't know whether I mentioned to you that on one of the visits in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, Ches-wef (ph) told me that he had a present for me and he handed me an envelope and they were pictures of my sister.</sentence><sentence id="6289">And he said that my father asked to take some pictures and Ches-wef (ph) was an amateur photographer, he had a Lika.</sentence><sentence id="6290">And he took the pictures and he gave me the copies.</sentence><sentence id="6291">He couldn't find the film but you don't have to have film now to make copies, so.</sentence><sentence id="6292">These are probably my, I consider them my very precious possessions, and I am still hoping that maybe something happened and she did survive.</sentence><sentence id="6293">But I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="6294">I know it just wouldn't be possible.</sentence><sentence id="6295">But not knowing whether they were killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or whether they were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or whether they died on the way, or whether they were put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, or what happened.</sentence><sentence id="6296">Just not knowing is probably much worse than if I really was told.</sentence><sentence id="6297">That this and this and this happened.</sentence><sentence id="6298">And then you just sort of put it away.</sentence><sentence id="6299">This is the same thing like <span class="BUILDING">funerals</span> and wakes or <span class="BUILDING">memorial services</span>, that you just sort of say good-bye to the person, say good-bye to the event, and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="6300">But in this way, you just don't know.</sentence><sentence id="6301">You don't want to consider the person dead because you don't know that they are dead.</sentence><sentence id="6302">And that's probably what keeps me awake very often and makes me sort of lead a double life.</sentence><sentence id="6303">And it's</sentence><sentence id="6305">28 probably the hardest thing.</sentence><sentence id="6306">Because most of the time, I look pretty.</sentence><sentence id="6307">As I told you that the first time when we talked on the phone, I am not a little old lady, 74 years old.</sentence><sentence id="6308">I take care of myself, I go to the <span class="BUILDING">hairdresser</span>, I put make-up on.</sentence><sentence id="6309">And I get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and I go through my exercises and I get dressed and I read the newspaper, eat breakfast, and we get in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6310">And all day long I work with young people.</sentence><sentence id="6311">I have a very responsible job in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I am working because I'm the one who has to see to it that all the costumes are ready for the performance at the specific time.</sentence><sentence id="6312">And they are.</sentence><sentence id="6313">And this is one of the things that I pride myself, that we haven't, were never late.</sentence><sentence id="6314">That all the costumes are in <span class="INT_SPACE">lockers</span>, all in order, a week before the dress rehearsal.</sentence><sentence id="6315">And then we are already working on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">production</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6316">So I feel that I am doing my job and I am always smiling, and very few people know what really is happening to me.</sentence><sentence id="6317">But I feel that even though I lead sort of a double life, most of it is only maybe 15% of my existence.</sentence><sentence id="6318">And that's why I don't like to be alone and most of the time Robert has to go on a trip, I go with him.</sentence><sentence id="6319">And very often when he has to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the evening, I go with him, and I can always work in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> or in my <span class="REGION">area</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, and wait for him.</sentence><sentence id="6320">But I don't like to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alone because then, I mean, I don't particularly like to watch television, I like to read.</sentence><sentence id="6321">But it is when I am alone is when I really sort of go back.</sentence><sentence id="6322">And I don't think that one can ever, ever forget.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6384">Q: Do you still have nightmares?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6386">A: Well yes I do.</sentence><sentence id="6387">And Robert can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="6388">And I can't describe exactly what happens but sometimes I wake up and I don't know where I am and sometimes I don't wake up and then I wake up, Robert is shaking me, and I say, "What's the matter with you?"</sentence><sentence id="6389">And he says, "Oh nothing, just go to sleep".</sentence><sentence id="6390">But sometimes he wakes me up and I'm in another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and not in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6391">And I really can't exactly describe what happens.</sentence><sentence id="6392">Probably the most recurring thing is that I'm somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I am looking for my parents or I'm looking for my sister, or I am running</sentence><sentence id="6394">29 away from something.</sentence><sentence id="6395">But I can't really describe it.</sentence><sentence id="6396">And I don't want to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="6397">I don't even want to talk about it to Robert.</sentence><sentence id="6398">And I did talk about it to Manny, that's my second husband.</sentence><sentence id="6399">But because I was in a much worse state when we got married, and I told him, I didn't want to get married because I didn't think that I was well enough.</sentence><sentence id="6400">But I knew that he wanted to have children and I didn't know that I should have any children.</sentence><sentence id="6401">And as I told you before, that I really did not, I wasn't a very good mother, and like my kids say, "Well, Margaret brought us up", and I don't think that they really feel deprived and they feel that I deprived them of something, letting Margaret bring them up, but it was better that Margaret was mothering them than, you know, in a good way, than me not doing it.</sentence><sentence id="6402">It was better for me to not do it at all than do it ina bad way.</sentence><sentence id="6403">But I did, I think that the worst part was when the children were little.</sentence><sentence id="6404">Then later on, when they were teen-agers, I did a lot of things with them and we went on trips and we went on a lot of camping trips.</sentence><sentence id="6405">Manny liked to go on camping trips and we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">house trailer</span> and food and then also I participate in the kid's education and I drove them to music lessons, to whatever lessons they had to go to and they all did very well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6406">I mean, when it came to their studies and things, I was able to participate.</sentence><sentence id="6407">But I think that the emotional part, I just couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="6408">I somehow feel that I could have done much more, you know, watching my friends with their children, that I haven't done as much as they did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6433">Q: You mentioned that you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> quite often.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6435">A: We go once a year.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6437">Q: Is that difficult for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6439">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="6440">This is why, it is not difficult now because the first time when we went it was a sightseeing trip for Robert.</sentence><sentence id="6441">We went from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another and then the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> trip, part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> trip was to go to the different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and to see Ches-waf (ph) and that was the first time I saw Ches- waf (ph) after the war.</sentence><sentence id="6442">And it really was catharsis, I think.</sentence><sentence id="6443">It was rather good for me.</sentence><sentence id="6444">It was a very</sentence><sentence id="6446">30 short trip, but the following year, we went for a whole month, or even five weeks.</sentence><sentence id="6447">And we did a lot of things, going back to the <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6448">We went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Poroskov</span> (ph) where my brother was and we walked through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and looked at the monuments.</sentence><sentence id="6449">And I think it really was good for me to do it.</sentence><sentence id="6450">And now we are going to go again, the 4th of June, we already have the tickets.</sentence><sentence id="6451">And we will be there this time only three weeks because we want to be one week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, Robert wants to go to the <span class="BUILDING">theatres</span>, and we plan to see our friends, and we planned again, we may even go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> again and walk the <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6452">I did walk it with my daughters a year ago.</sentence><sentence id="6453">And of course, it isn't the same, you walk on a <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>, on a <span class="DLF">paved road</span>, and it is not very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="6454">But I would have preferred to go before they made the paved <span class="DLF">road</span>, but anyway, we may walk again.</sentence><sentence id="6455">And I think it is, I don't think it is painful as much as it is just getting it out of my system and realizing that life goes on.</sentence><sentence id="6456">That I am alive.</sentence><sentence id="6457">That I walk the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6458">There is another thing.</sentence><sentence id="6459">When I learned to drive, and before we came to <span class="REGION">California</span>, we bought a little Nash Rambler for me.</sentence><sentence id="6460">And we towed it behind the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> so we had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6461">And I drove the Nash Rambler for several years until finally I was in a car accident and it kind of curled up when I was through with it.</sentence><sentence id="6462">And so we went shopping for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6463">And it was several years ago because I remember Bobby was 4 years old then.</sentence><sentence id="6464">So we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Chrysler agency</span> I believe because we were going to look at another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Chrysler</span>, and there I backed into a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6465">And I turned around, because I wanted a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and I said, "Oh, that's my size!</sentence><sentence id="6466">And it is robin egg blue!"</sentence><sentence id="6467">I loved that color.</sentence><sentence id="6468">And my husband said, "Stay away from it".</sentence><sentence id="6469">And I said, "Why?"

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6570">A: It became very, very expensive.</sentence><sentence id="6571">And everybody wanted my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>.</sentence><sentence

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6584">I want to</sentence><sentence id="6586">32 drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>".</sentence><sentence id="6587">He says, "Yes, and we'll go to a <span class="BUILDING">Chinese restaurant</span> and park the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> just in front in the <span class="DLF">parking lot</span> and they will start serving, you pick up you're chop sticks and you put them down and then say, "Robert, I think somebody's taking off the hub caps, will you go and look at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>?".</sentence><sentence id="6588">And he says, "I want to eat dinner and not to watch you're <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>".</sentence><sentence id="6589">So we are not going to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="6590">Well, we cleaned up the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> and we drove the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6591">And once ina while I would go and look at it.</sentence><sentence id="6592">We replaced the hubcaps, and the back light, but I didn't drive it anymore.</sentence><sentence id="6593">And one beautiful day, I made a decision.</sentence><sentence id="6594">That the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span> served its time and it's purpose and life goes on, and we knew a builder who said, "I will build you a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>".</sentence><sentence id="6595">And I did have a very, we have a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> was very small.</sentence><sentence id="6596">And we had a special dinner for a group of friends, about fourteen people.</sentence><sentence id="6597">And we had to put up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bridge tables</span> and all kinds of things to make enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="6598">And I always said, "I wish I could have a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>".</sentence><sentence id="6599">And Robert said, "Well, this is you're opportunity".</sentence><sentence id="6600">And we get rid of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6601">Al was the name of the builder and he said, "I'll take good care of it and you will have a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>".</sentence><sentence id="6602">And I made the decision.</sentence><sentence id="6603">All right.</sentence><sentence id="6604">And he brought his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flat bed</span> because he didn't want to drive it after sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garage</span> for ten years or so, and they put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flat bed</span> and he drove away.</sentence><sentence id="6605">And the next morning he started ripping up the old <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and now I have a beautiful, big <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> that will seat fourteen people.</sentence><sentence id="6606"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drexel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6607">A beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room set</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6608">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porsche</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Porch</span> is in good hands and I don't even want to know what happened to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6650">Q: Could you talk a little bit about the work that you've done?</sentence><sentence id="6651">I know you mentioned that you've gotten three Master's Degrees?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6654">A: Well yes.</sentence><sentence id="6655">There is the Medical Technology, and then I did work for about a year and a half in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> but then when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresno</span>, I discovered I was pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="6656">So I, and then my husband</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6659">33 worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I thought of getting a job there but then I really didn't want to work because I really was afraid that maybe that might hurt the baby and being in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with diseases and things, so I decided to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6660">But I still kept my Registry, you had to be registered in <span class="REGION">California</span> for several years, until I eventually gave that up.</sentence><sentence id="6661">I decided I don't want to be Medical Technologist after all.</sentence><sentence id="6662">And I, when the children were little, especially when, even through my first pregnancy, I took painting lessons.</sentence><sentence id="6663">And I was doing a lot of painting and I enjoyed that very much.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6664">Then I joined <span class="BUILDING">Community Theatre</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6665">And they found out that I can paint and act, so I was acting in some plays.</sentence><sentence id="6666">And also they wanted me to help with the scenery.</sentence><sentence id="6667">And since, I really, I knew how to paint pictures but I didn't know that much about scenery, I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6668">At that time it still was <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, now it is a <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6669">And I enrolled in the Drama Department.</sentence><sentence id="6670">And then they said, well, why don't you just work on you're degree instead of just taking courses.</sentence><sentence id="6671">So I said, fine.</sentence><sentence id="6672">And I acted.</sentence><sentence id="6673">And I was an assistant to the scene designer.</sentence><sentence id="6674">I designed scenery for the <span class="BUILDING">Community Theatre</span> and then I designed scenery for our <span class="BUILDING">University Theatre</span> and I got a Masters Degree in <span class="BUILDING">Theatre</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6675">And, at the same time, I wanted to polish up my skills in painting, so I went to the Art Department and I started getting, you know, just to get some classes in drawing and painting and sculpture.</sentence><sentence id="6676">And then they said, you've got enough credits now, you can really get you're Master's Degree.</sentence><sentence id="6677">So I started to take more graduate classes and I did get a Master's Degree in Art.</sentence><sentence id="6678">And that I got with distinction because I did some innovative process on my sculptures and the thesis was ceramic bowls.</sentence><sentence id="6679">And it was really stone ware.</sentence><sentence id="6680">And then I silver, copper and silver.</sentence><sentence id="6681">Over the stone ware.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6682">And the whole thing was, again, a wonderful catharsis though, because the symbol of the bowl.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6683">When we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we got a bowl.</sentence><sentence id="6684">One of those big, enamel bowls that were made in, probably in <span class="BUILDING">Schindler's factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6685">And they are on display.</sentence><sentence id="6686">And here there is just a small case, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> there is a case the size of a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> filled with bowls.</sentence><sentence id="6687">And this was probably, once</sentence><sentence id="6689">34 more, most precious possession.</sentence><sentence id="6690">Because if you didn't have a bowl, you could not get food.</sentence><sentence id="6691">That was the only way you could get you're cup of coffee or you're bowl of soup.</sentence><sentence id="6692">So the bowl was something that you put under you're <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> made out of blanket or a rag.</sentence><sentence id="6693">And you really guarded it with your life, because this was your life.</sentence><sentence id="6694">So I decided to make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bowls</span> that are completely useless.</sentence><sentence id="6695">I like pretty things so I made everything very pretty.</sentence><sentence id="6696">But you can't put anything in that bowl, they are either too small or too big or too crocked or too pretty.</sentence><sentence id="6697">You wouldn't put soup in a bowl that has beautiful design inside.</sentence><sentence id="6698">But then it is all goocked up with some kind of acid to make it shiny and polished and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="6699">I don't think the soup would taste very well mixed with the chemicals.</sentence><sentence id="6700">So I made a lot of bowls.</sentence><sentence id="6701">And they are not just bowls, they are containers.</sentence><sentence id="6702">Different types of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">containers</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6703">And I was making them just in the Art Department.</sentence><sentence id="6704">Some of them are thrown on a wheel, some of them are just built up.</sentence><sentence id="6705">And then when I got through with the stone ware and the enamel, I would move on to the chemistry department, which they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">lab</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="6706">And that's where I would perform the forming.</sentence><sentence id="6707">It is quite a complicated process.</sentence><sentence id="6708">If you use copper sulfate and the silver cyanide, and sulfate acid and electricity.</sentence><sentence id="6709">And I had a lot of fun connecting wires and doing things...</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6710">[End of Side A of Tape 8]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="6711">Q: Go on.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6712">A: Anyway, he gave me a cyanide resuscitation kit.</sentence><sentence id="6713">Just in case I have an accident with the silver cyanide or the gold cyanide that I was working with.</sentence><sentence id="6714">And the cyanide has a bitter almond smell that you can really smell it if it gets spilled and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="6715">Anyway, the resuscitation kit is a, I don't know exactly what it was, I still have it.</sentence><sentence id="6716">This big syringe of something or other.</sentence><sentence id="6717">I don't think I, I told him I don't want to even think of using it, but anyway, and I was laughing and I said, "I know what cyanide is".</sentence><sentence id="6718">And I know it smells like bitter almonds.</sentence><sentence id="6719">That was probably one of the best cures for</sentence><sentence id="6721">35 me in a certain way because I was working with materials that were the deaths in some, and the hopelessness.</sentence><sentence id="6722">And here I was doing and making beautiful things for the future.</sentence><sentence id="6723">So it is sometimes very difficult, but on the other hand, it is easy if you really want it.</sentence><sentence id="6724">So this is what I was doing and when I finished I had an exhibit at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6725">And then I had an exhibit at the <span class="BUILDING">Art Center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6726">And then everybody was admiring the bowls and Manny wouldn't let me sell any.</sentence><sentence id="6727">And I says, "Well, just a few".</sentence><sentence id="6728">I had made some little ones and those were for sale, but everybody was very upset that I don't want to part with them.</sentence><sentence id="6729">So I said no.</sentence><sentence id="6730">And then my Professor suggested that I send them to several <span class="BUILDING">exhibits</span> and every time I send them to <span class="BUILDING">exhibits</span> they were accepted.</sentence><sentence id="6731">Most of the time I send slides and then I have to send the real thing and the one at the <span class="BUILDING">Oaken Museum</span>, they specialize in crafts and and , they have one of my bowls.</sentence><sentence id="6732">They purchased it.</sentence><sentence id="6733">It was a purchase award.</sentence><sentence id="6734">And it is in the permanent collection.</sentence><sentence id="6735">And then the big thing was a traveling exhibit, which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Paul</span>, <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> and at the <span class="BUILDING">Renwick Gallery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and it was photographed for the album, for the souvenir album.</sentence><sentence id="6736">So it was all great honors.</sentence><sentence id="6737">And also I had one bowl exhibit at, and in the catalogue, actually it is more of a book, it's a <span class="BUILDING">California Design 11</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6738">So these were the great honors I had.</sentence><sentence id="6739">And when I finally got my Master's Degree, I finally got a job at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> in the Art Department, teaching crafts and design and ceramics and elementary art education.</sentence><sentence id="6740">And I took the class for the elementary art education, which was training teachers who were in child development.</sentence><sentence id="6741">At that time the major in child development because very hard and so we had a lot of students and we taught them, among other things, the basic art procedures that they can use with children.</sentence><sentence id="6742">And I enjoyed that very much because I never did any art with my kids and here I was teaching future teachers and I did quite a few innovative things.</sentence><sentence id="6743">I think I was quite successful at it.</sentence><sentence id="6744">One thing that I would say is, after being this sterility case, I ended up having four children.</sentence><sentence id="6745">Three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cribs</span> in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6746">I had four children and none in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they are supposed to</sentence><sentence id="6748">36 start at the age of five.</sentence><sentence id="6749">They were just about a year and a year and a half apart.</sentence><sentence id="6750">And that they all became very successful citizens, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="6751">Maxine, the one that lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Springs</span>, that's her second time in the Washington, D.C. area.</sentence><sentence id="6752">She is a soil scientist and she, after all these years, she finally worked up to a little bit higher position than she started with.</sentence><sentence id="6753">And that's where she gave up the job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davis</span>, <span class="REGION">California</span>, because she got another promotion and she decided to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6754">And Maxine is not married.</sentence><sentence id="6755">But Eleanor is a physician, she is a cardiologist.</sentence><sentence id="6756">And she is the Chief of Cardiology at <span class="BUILDING">Kaiser Permanente</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Clara</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6757">They live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Altos</span> and she is married to a physician who is an endocrinologist but he works in research.</sentence><sentence id="6758">And then the next one is Robert, Bobby.</sentence><sentence id="6759">That's the only son.</sentence><sentence id="6760">And he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in finances, whatever that is.</sentence><sentence id="6761">He's a broker and he's also an author of two books on politics. "</sentence><sentence id="6762">Democratic Blueprints" and one that was sort of a promotional book for Bill Clinton. "</sentence><sentence id="6763">Bill Clinton, the Politician", or whatever the title was.</sentence><sentence id="6764">And then the youngest daughter graduated from, well she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berkley</span> and then she graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Humbolt University</span>, which is in <span class="REGION">Northern California</span>, in environmental science.</sentence><sentence id="6765">And she was a backcountry ranger for eleven years.</sentence><sentence id="6766">And she was patrolling the <span class="REGION">area</span> in Kern River Canyon for six months and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for six months.</sentence><sentence id="6767">And she finally graduated and then she got her credentials and now she is a sixth grade teacher married to a music teacher.</sentence><sentence id="6768">And she herself is an accomplished musician.</sentence><sentence id="6769">She has played the bassoon and the violin.</sentence><sentence id="6770">And Eleanor, who is the doctor, is an accomplished harpsichord player.</sentence><sentence id="6771">I sort of mention that because, again, life goes on.</sentence><sentence id="6772">And I am looking forward to my grandchildren growing up.</sentence><sentence id="6773">Eleanor has three boys and , the youngest, has a boy and a girl.</sentence><sentence id="6774">And that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
