had issued, that is was illegal to go from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="645">Then the Germans gave a systematic way how to eliminate Jews.</sentence><sentence id="646">Actually, there was no more fear that somebody would knock at your <span class="DLF">door</span> and kill you, but there was rules in the next month or so, all Jews should move out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">City</span> and move into this specific <span class="REGION">area</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobotka</span>, which was the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1942">A: This was in "44, March or April -- August "44.</sentence><sentence id="1943">The majority of people, especially the</sentence><sentence id="1945">0 younger people, knew what was happening, and they already had certain feeling that this would happen.</sentence><sentence id="1946">They were building some <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1947">There was certain involved activity in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> during last six months before, maybe eight months before, to organize and build a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> where you would hide in case -- we had enough knowledge that war was coming to the end, somehow in case they would decide to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, everybody would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1948">So, we had the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, one of the major hiding place was this two <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and under the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> they dug out a long <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>, and there they made like a shelter, like a <span

us in.</sentence><sentence id="1951">Because you know it had a capacity of people for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, on so many people can go in.</sentence><sentence id="1952">So, we turned around, and we built our own shelter, because I had two days time approximately, which the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>, there was a big <span class="DLF">field</span>, like <span class="REGION">farm land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1953">We dug a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> about five feet deep or whatever it is, and removed from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a few <span class="DLF">doors</span>, put across and put on top some shrubbery, and there we put some water and a loaf of bread, and we went into this <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>, me and my wife.</sentence><sentence id="1954">And we were sitting there and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was already, the last <span

there were any people left.</sentence><sentence id="1955">And they came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were, and we heard the one German tell, there's nobody here.</sentence><sentence id="1956">And they were leaving already and we thought fine.</sentence><sentence id="1957">So, only one German walked over our <span class="INT_SPACE">hiding place</span> and stepped on the two <span class="DLF">doors</span> where we had space for air to come in and stepped in with his foot, went in, and he started to scream.</sentence><sentence id="1958">He got scared.</sentence><sentence id="1959">He said there are Jews underground and everybody came running and surrounded us with rifles, and said out, out whoever is there and we went out.</sentence><sentence id="1960">And then -- it was terrible in there, we had perspired and there was dirt coming down on us and -- then he put us against the <span

think we should kill you, but we will take you to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where you will be useful.</sentence><sentence id="1964">And go <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, rush around,
