<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: I would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="447">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="448">In fact, the <span class="INT_SPACE">children's kitchen</span> was somewhere else from the adults and the food was very much the same.</sentence><sentence id="449">I mean children did not get very much more.</sentence><sentence id="450">I mean there was hardly ever any milk, and if there was, it was for, it was so watered down or children with TB and things like that who got sometimes a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="451">Almost everybody had it anyway.</sentence><sentence id="452">And there was a rumor going around that we were going to have an inspection in our <span class="DLF">block</span> and the inspection was by women, ausewiber they called them.</sentence><sentence id="453">An especially very mean SS women who would search the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="454">We would have to leave the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and if even one cigarette or one potato would be found, that would be the end.</sentence><sentence id="455">So we were sleeping on the potatoes and we didn't know what to do with these potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="456">So my father found a plan and he found an old suitcase and put some of these potatoes in and was the death of night and you actually a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="457">You weren't supposed to be out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and the lights were supposed to be out.</sentence><sentence id="458">There was a full moon.</sentence><sentence id="459">So he had a plan to put these potatoes under a pile of rags, that they should

snow.</sentence><sentence id="462">So he picked them up and he hid them under this pile of rags.</sentence><sentence id="463">Now in the meantime, these women came and we were told to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and assemble.</sentence><sentence id="464">And I remember I was so afraid with my doll that one of them would break him, I don't remember if I left the doll there or if I took the doll with me.</sentence><sentence id="465">But it was dangerous take anything with you because they thought you were hiding something and that's how we saved, and then a day later when the <span class="DLF">coast</span> was clear; they didn't find anything, then they...we got the potatoes back.</sentence><sentence id="466">I remember the worst day for me was a day in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="467">It was November 11.</sentence><sentence id="468">The rumor went around that people were missing; that people had escaped.</sentence><sentence id="469">And perhaps some people did escape.</sentence><sentence id="470">But of course it was very hard to get out because you had to jump from the <span class="DLF">high walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="471">And if you did, you broke most of your bones and who would help you then.</sentence><sentence id="472">And even if you did get out in one piece, who would help you when you got out?</sentence><sentence id="473">People didn't know anybody on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to give you some food or where to go, etc.and I mean you had the SS guarding the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="474">And we were herded out one cold November morning.</sentence><sentence id="475">Always something happened between 9", 10, or 11" of November, starting from Kristallnacht on.</sentence><sentence id="476">Every November 9", 10", 11", we were always afraid something terrible would happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="477">We were herded outside of the

everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to go.</sentence><sentence id="479">Sick or half- dead, everybody was marched out.</sentence><sentence id="480">And we were standing in little groups and I remember Heindel, one of the worst and meanest SS men kept on walking around and counting and beating people when they lost their way and we didn't get food all day.</sentence><sentence id="481">There were no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="482">It was just a horrible, horrible day.</sentence><sentence id="483">It was now I know what was supposed to happen on that day.</sentence><sentence id="484">I think that they really did not only want to count us.</sentence><sentence id="485">Probably what they wanted to do is either shoot down, Babi Yar style or send the whole transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on that day.</sentence><sentence id="486">Because news had leaked out to the British radio.</sentence><sentence id="487">And that we were all standing there, about 50,000-60,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="488">It was raining.</sentence><sentence id="489">I remember our feet sank into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span>.</sentence><sentence id="490">It was just an awful day.</sentence><sentence id="491">Mice were running around in that <span class="DLF">field</span> and that news had leaked out and consequently orders came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to let us go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="492">And we went back in the death of night, maybe 11:00-12:00 And they were beating us.</sentence><sentence id="493">We were holding on to each other.</sentence><sentence id="494">They said no.</sentence><sentence id="495">Men and women should be separate.</sentence><sentence id="496">We wouldn't let go of each other.</sentence><sentence id="497">My mother was beaten up very badly that day.</sentence><sentence id="498">One of the butts of a rifle went right into my mother's back because we would not separate.</sentence><sentence id="499">We were holding on to each other and we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="500">And soon afterwards you had this commission from the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">And I remember it very well.</sentence><sentence id="502">The whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> had to be cleaned up.</sentence><sentence id="503">Certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> had signs on them...To <span class="BUILDING">School</span>...To <span class="BUILDING">Playground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="504">A band shell was erected in the <span class="DLF">park</span>, a <span class="DLF">park</span> that we were never even allowed to go to and children were given some better food just as the commission went by.</sentence><sentence id="505">I think I saw the commission but we were not allowed to go out of our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="506">I just saw them from far away.</sentence><sentence id="507">A film was made at that time to show supposedly the good conditions of the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="508">Soon afterwards when the commission had left, everything went back to where it was before.</sentence><sentence id="509">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> began again.</sentence><sentence id="510">In fact, the worst <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were in 1944, in the fall.</sentence><sentence id="511">It was during the High Holidays in September and October.</sentence><sentence id="512">And I remember how the people even fasted on Yom Kippur and afterwards went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">I remember how they put on their boots, etc.</sentence><sentence id="514">and prayed with their last breathes, so to speak, God Help Us.</sentence><sentence id="515">I remember one of the prayers Alvenu Malkenu, God remember, for instance, disabled war veterans who had very important parts, I don't need to go into certain things, genitals shot off.</sentence><sentence id="516">I remember one who even took his, my father told me, he dropped his pants to show them that he was wounded so badly and he had all these catheters in and out and even he was shipped off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="517">I mean the selection was very brutal and you really were not safe just because you were a disabled war veteran or even if you were a highly decorated war veteran.</sentence><sentence id="518">I mean there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> with EK-1 Iron Cross, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> who were shipped out in mass or sometimes only doctors, sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="519">It depended exactly what they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="520">Old people, young people, whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="521">And I remember also during the...to transgress a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="522">Some things that come back to me.</sentence><sentence id="523">I mean that
