<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="30">Q: Oh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zazel</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for awhile.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="32">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="34">Q: And then you went to Bergen-Belsen death camp, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="36">A: That's correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="38">Q: And I would like to ask you, around the time -- and you were liberated from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: Correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Speak a little bit about the time just before liberation.</sentence><sentence id="43">What was it like for you, what state of mind were you in?</sentence><sentence id="44">What was your -- your health at that time?</sentence><sentence id="45">Where were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="50">And then, when liberation happened, what was that like?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="51">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="52">Actually, when the liberation happened, I didn't feel any ela-elation, because I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">I was still lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of something which looked like a very big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">There were still mountains of skeletons around me, and the skeletons were actually people, who were once human being.</sentence><sentence id="55">And then, also, you could see people with diarrhea, with typhus, running aimlessly to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> and back.</sentence><sentence id="56">So, nothing changed, in a way, and so what I did, I was lying on this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">Somehow I got pencil and paper, and I did writing, and writing, and writing.</sentence><sentence id="58">I wish I kept those papers, but I didn't.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="59">Anyhow, we would --</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="63"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0059 4</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: How did it -- how did it happen though?</sentence><sentence id="65">You were in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: Yeah, it was -- it -- I was in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, and they were saying that the English army is approaching, and they -- we should not go to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> too early, because we might be shot.</sentence><sentence id="67">So we -- but -- and they opened the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, and -- and came in.</sentence><sentence id="68">Probably, when you have been incarcerated for such a long time, you cannot switch.</sentence><sentence id="69">Anyhow, in my case, besides that -- at that moment, actually -- maybe not exactly that moment, I realized that I'll never see my parents again, because there was no way for them to survive these horrors.</sentence><sentence id="70">So, in a way, I started thinking about my family, and I started thinking about all these people who perished, and this writing probably was a way to put my feelings into papers.</sentence><sentence id="71">Now, I was, all this time, in the -- actually, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> too, but we didn't have much of a -- we didn't see each other quite often, but I was with my cousin, Rene Berlinska.</sentence><sentence id="72">We met at the place where we were supposed to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and we stayed -- we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> together, and we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="73">And we survived together.</sentence><sentence id="74">So I actually, when they took us and -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zazel</span>, I had a feeling that we are going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we won't come out alive, so I jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but fortunately they did -- they picked me up, and I was expecting afterwards that I will be punished, but I wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="75">Probably, among this Nazi girls, there was already awareness that the war is being lost.</sentence><sentence id="76">So, that -- not always stopped them, and I'll tell you later, for instance, with my husband, who was -- who was liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aren</span>, close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>, the SS loaded them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and brought them someplace where they</sentence></p><p><sentence id="79">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 5 asked the Wehrmarkt to shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="80">However, the <span class="BUILDING">Wehrmarkt</span> say, "We are soldiers, we don't shoot people."</sentence><sentence id="81">And this way, 19 people were saved.</sentence><sentence id="82">Now we -- so we were moved to some <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> which -- my cousin believes they were <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span>, and the -- we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, with eight other girls, and they were wonderful girls.</sentence><sentence id="83">We are -- we always have been friends with them.</sentence><sentence id="84">Now, I --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Was that after -- was that already liberation, or was that still before liberation [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="86">A: No, all what I'm saying now, they -- the Germans wouldn't have moved us.</sentence><sentence id="87">They -- I mean, they wanted to finish us off, you know.</sentence><sentence id="88">But after the liberation, we have been transferred, so probably the very sick ones were, I assume, transferred to some ar -- to some -- something which was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> -- maybe a <span class="BUILDING">makeshift hospital</span>, but a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">Unfortunately, in their goodness, the soldiers gave us food like chocolate, which we were not able to digest.</sentence><sentence id="90">I probably -- I don't know why -- they did not consume any of this, and they -- so it didn't affect me, but as tragic as it is, some people who already had problems, got very, very sick.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="96">Q: Who liberated you though?</sentence><sentence id="97">We haven't said that yet.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="100">A: Yeah, woo -- I was liberated by the English army.</sentence><sentence id="101">And the -- so, I mean, as I said again, they wanted to -- they knew that we are starving.</sentence><sentence id="102">Now, they realized it pretty fast, that the food which we'll be able to digest is a different food than -- then they fed us the right food.</sentence><sentence id="103">Now, when I was in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the girls, which -- it's amazing when I</sentence><sentence id="105">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 6 think about it, it seems that they were actually very comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, because in comparison what was before, but my energy was coming back, and so I decided to go and get clothes, and I found out that there is some distribution point in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and when I came back, I had a beautiful blue outfit, and I had also a hat, and I also brought some clothes for the girls with whom I was living.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: How did you -- how did -- how were you able to go to -- to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: I think it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">You know, I tried to -- I tried to think about it, and in fact, when I came back, I was -- it was so impressive to some people, they -- there was a younger man who wanted to marry me right away, and the -- my resourcefulness was coming back to me.</sentence><sentence id="119">So I didn't -- I f -- I was fortunate in a way that one day when I looked out, I saw somebody approaching, and who was it?</sentence><sentence id="120">It was the venerable Mr. Klipp, and I shouted out, "Panya Klipp, Panya Klipp," Panya is mister in Polish, and here he was.</sentence><sentence id="121">He used to be the -- the boss of the food supply in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="122">He was very respected, and he -- he was not only the head of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, but also the head of other departments, and -- however, I remember one thing, which we -- I shouldn't maybe say, that I had diarrhea.</sentence><sentence id="123">So I went to him, and wanted some rice.</sentence><sentence id="124">And he somehow refused to give it to me.</sentence><sentence id="125">And what was happening, he was an -- he was an unusual person with in -- impeccable integrity, and so he was allowed to have additional rations of food.</sentence><sentence id="126">He didn't accept that til his -- til his wife's sister -- no, it was his own sister, his own sister, was sick.</sentence><sentence id="127">So, of course, I was very happy to see him,</sentence><sentence id="129">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 7 it's just like seeing somebody from the previous life, and he was -- he was liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Arlen</span>, as I mentioned before, and he was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">I actually was hoping that my brother Hershlite Feingarten, whom we called Lolec, survived.</sentence><sentence id="131">He was only one and a half year older than I, and he was extremely capable, and if he would have survived, he would have been a famous engineer, because as a child, he took apart our grandfather's clock, and put it together, and since he was missing a part, he used a string, and that fa -- gar -- grandfather's clock was working.</sentence><sentence id="132">Now, I also was hoping that Aroush, our adopted cousin, when he -- he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with his parents -- now, first his father was departed, then his mother was deported, and then we did adopt him, and my mother [indecipherable] from a skin disease, and my father got the skin disease, I must have mentioned it on my other tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, right.</sentence><sentence id="153">Anyhow, he was, unfortunately -- okay, I never found my brother, and I never found Aroush, but I found out that my brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, and people actually saw him very shortly before the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="154">However, I looked for him, and I couldn't find him.</sentence><sentence id="155">Neither did I find <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aroush</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">And Aroush -- I remember when Aroush was born, the joy, and the festivities were absolutely wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="157">We were celebrating for a whole week, and the -- the whole family was just elated.</sentence><sentence id="158">Now we -- I mentioned that Dave was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> when I was in my quest to look for Lolec and Aroush, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>, I worked afterwards in a -- in a dep -- ina</sentence><sentence id="161">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 8 <span class="NPIP">place</span> where a -- there was a representation of UNRRA, U-N-N-R -- I think they said W- A, which means United Nations relief, and we were distributing food.</sentence><sentence id="162">So I worked there for a time, and there I had the honor to meet Mayor LaGuardia.</sentence><sentence id="163">He was working for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, and he was visiting the <span class="BUILDING">distribution centers</span>, so I have a picture of him, and -- and when we were talking to him, you could see in his expression the horror, and the unbelief in his face.</sentence><sentence id="164">He just stopped for awhile, and just looked really very, very unpleasantly impressed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="178">Q: So, he had only limited information of what -- what had happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Probably, because the -- I will show you the pictures, and you can see from his face that he just couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="181">I guess, judging from the words of Eisenhower, he says he has to document it, because nobody, but nobody would believe it, what they did to so many people.</sentence><sentence id="182">And the -- so, it is really very difficult to comprehend.</sentence><sentence id="183">Now, as the time passes by, to tell you the truth, it's much more for me to comprehend how all this was possible, and the -- in fact, it -- fortunately, I am very busy, but the pictures, let's say, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, they are always -- anyhow, quite frequently, very vividly in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="184">And now, when I was making that tape, I didn't mention that a person whom I approach to ask for my mother, going on my side of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, which meant work, I didn't realize then that it meant life, it was Mengele, and the -- in my husband's ta -- tape, it's mentioned that it was Mengele.</sentence><sentence id="185">Now, we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="189"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0059 9</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Wh-Why was it -- why was it that you went in your search for your family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>, because there are -- were more resources to find -- wa --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: No, at that time -- at that time, we did not have a registry yet.</sentence><sentence id="192">You know, it was just by talking to people, which I did, so I was told that they saw him, so my hopes were really up, but it -- all the search which I made, was in vain.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: What -- what time was that now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: That was still 1945, because we were liberated in -- I believe it was April.</sentence><sentence id="198">It was still 19 fa -- it was very shortly after, I just started the search right -- right after.</sentence><sentence id="199">Now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>, Dave, shortly after, I don't know the exact date, Dave realized that the refugees are just lost, and h-he contacted the German authorities to -- to organize some facilities where we can get food rations, where they -- we can get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>, when the -- when we can get directions.</sentence><sentence id="200">And he was quite successful, thanks to his mastery of the German language, he was -- til the last minish he was able to write a letter in German, really beautifully, and without mistakes, I was always very impressed with it.</sentence><sentence id="201">And he also had a businessman's background.</sentence><sentence id="202">So, he organized that, and it functioned for quite awhile, and it was an enormous help.</sentence><sentence id="203">So, I was living -- you know, it was much nicer living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">There were also many refugees there, many survivors, and they -- of course there was Dave, who was only 17 years older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="205">However, with his energy, and his equanimity, and his wonderful attitude towards people, chronologically there was a difference, but in energy level, and in zest of life, we -- actually was none.</sentence><sentence id="206">So, we did get</sentence><sentence id="208"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0059 10 married, and we got married on March 16, 1946.</sentence><sentence id="209">Most of the survivors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> were - - I would say, were at the wedding, and who officiated over that ceremony was an elderly man who was from German origin, and -- and he was really qualified to -- to conduct the ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="210">And the -- I have, of course, pictures.</sentence><sentence id="211">I have the pictures of the other survivors who attended the wedding.</sentence><sentence id="212">Now what -- of course, we wanted to -- to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and the <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was very easy for us to decide, because Dave's -- Dave knew that he has a sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, but Dave was liberated by the Americans, and one of the American army personnel promised him to get in touch with his sister, which he did, and we started even receiving letters from her, and of course our destination, because of that, was to go and join his sister, her husband, and they had a -- a son who was going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, studying accounting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Can I ask you two -- two -- two question?</sentence><sentence id="231">What was -- what were the conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: In the beginning -- now, we -- we actually did not expect much, considering our past.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="235">Now we were giving food through the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, then, of course, is a -- many people were living on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberstrasser</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">Oberstrasser was the seat of -- before the war, that was the Yiddish geminda, which means like stat the council -- the council of the -- and, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: The <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: No, n-not the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span>, the council.</sentence><sentence id="239">Stat --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: The council, right.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="243"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0059 11</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: The council.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: And the -- so it was the Yiddish geminda, and the -- well, these <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> were available to the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="249">And then once these facilities were establish, which my husband was happy to establish, then we also were able to get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> with some German families.</sentence><sentence id="250">And we also were able to get food rations, and the -- so life became more livable.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: Was it difficult though, to live with German people, so shortly after --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: See, that is a very interesting question.</sentence><sentence id="256">We didn't want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because we didn't know who, of the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, was instrumental in this horrors.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1419">A: Very often I think -- we had a -- it's mentioned the tape, we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and [indecipherable] in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and we were hiding there whenever there was deportation, pretty successfully, and very often I think, maybe if we wouldn't have gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, maybe if we would have been hiding there, but then I think, where would we get food?</sentence><sentence id="1420">And of course, we didn't know, because there were actually <span class="DLF">graves</span> prepared for the people who were designated to clean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litzmanshtadt</span>, so even the Rukoski went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1423">They were so deceiving, the Nazis, that they were able to convince us that we are going to a better <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1424">Anyhow, that haunts me so very often, because I figured maybe -- then maybe we would been able to -- to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1425">Then, I often see the picture of my brother.</sentence><sentence id="1426">He became rather -- rather religious.</sentence><sentence id="1427">And in the</sentence><sentence id="1429">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 55 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he used to lay the tefillin, which they something you put on your head, and you wrap your arm, and he was extremely handsome.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And, so it's a great pain that he didn't survive.</sentence><sentence id="1431">Then, of course, I often think of my mother, she was an exceptional woman, never complained either.</sentence><sentence id="1432">And -- and w-which other memories?</sentence><sentence id="1433">Course I remember, yeah, there was -- but that is in my tape, this -- when we were walking with this wooden shoes, and the -- it was the -- ice was growing under our shoes, and they did not permit us to stop and clear it, and I also -- also it was very often on my mind, there was one Mrs.Cohen.</sentence><sentence id="1434">She was a mother of a girl maybe a little bit younger than me.</sentence><sentence id="1435">She was very often whipped and punished, and -- but, going back to the alternative medicine, in connection even with that, and to the yoga, which I practice religiously every day, and I feel that I can stretch better, really, as time progresses.</sentence><sentence id="1436">I became stronger, emotionally.</sentence><sentence id="1437">So, when these memories come, I still could realize that I cannot allow them to take over, because there is still so much I have to do right now.</sentence><sentence id="1438">And the -- for instance, I learned yoga actually, when I was quite young, from Indra Davy, and she was from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1439">And then for about 20 years, I couldn't do it, because I had a pain in my back, lower back, which didn't nutch -- nothing -- nothing wrong showed up on MRI, but I had this pain.</sentence><sentence id="1440">Now, when my chiropractor learned to do -- she used to helped me, but it was coming back.</sentence><sentence id="1441">Then she learned a certain method, which is developed by doctor -- Dr. Donald Epstein from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, which was called networking, which is actually they just touch certain points, and miraculously, it sounds strange, but I'll tell you anyhow about it.</sentence><sentence id="1442">One time,</sentence><sentence id="1444">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 56 short -- maybe two weeks after she was practicing it with me -- on me, my arm started -- started moving in yoga positions.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And the -- since then -- of course, I tried to -- it's getting better, and better, but I do not have the problem with my back now, and I started doing yoga.</sentence><sentence id="1446">And actually my yoga is improving as | -- I don't know whether I mentioned it before.</sentence><sentence id="1447">And I can do -- I can stretch better as the time progresses, and it gives me awfully good feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1448">Besides that, there are seven postures, specially the ones which stretch the neck, which have a big, relaxing influence over the emotions.</sentence><sentence id="1449">And I guess also the nutrition which I practice.</sentence><sentence id="1450">Now, there is s -- something called he -- hemio -- hemiopathy -- homeopathy.</sentence><sentence id="1451">And it was actually discovered in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, about more than 200 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="1452">And these remedies are also very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="1453">Now, in order to know which vitamin is good for us, which is not, or [indecipherable] food, there is a method used by chiropractors, and also other practitioners of alternative medicine, called muscle testing.</sentence><sentence id="1454">The people who do it are kinesthiologists.</sentence><sentence id="1455">That's how they call themself.</sentence><sentence id="1456">Now, one chiropractor taught me how to do it, and I w -- I'm trying to teach others, but I don't know why, I am not successful.</sentence><sentence id="1457">I only was able to teach my grandson.</sentence><sentence id="1458">He just was so impressed, because the idea of this muscle testing is such.</sentence><sentence id="1459">If we put into our bodies, whether it's a [indecipherable] vitamin or food, which is

Archives RG-50.549.02*0059 57 trying to push it down.</sentence><sentence id="1464">If the remedy is not good for the body, the arm will go down.</sentence><sentence id="1465">If it's good for the body, it won't go.</sentence><sentence id="1466">And the same can be used with the fingers, which I -- which I use, and I'm pretty accurate at it.</sentence><sentence id="1467">Now this was helping me very much with my husband, because I was able to determine whether things are good for him or not, and it's a great help to me, because I am able to resist what is not good for me, since I know it.</sentence><sentence id="1468">Now, I know of a doctor who used to be a doctor of alter -- of emergency medicine, and he -- he is now doing alternative medicine, and he uses -- he has a machine

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1760">Q: I'm just curious [indecipherable] are you following sort, of some of the controversies around Holocaust studies?</sentence><sentence id="1761">I mean some people would say that the discussion there has become very, very academic, and is taking away from the -- from the human experience in that way.</sentence><sentence id="1762">Or that too much emphasis is being put on -- on -- on -- on the Holocaust, as over against other aspects of Jewish culture.</sentence><sentence id="1763">How do you --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1764">A: They say if you forget history, it repeats itself.</sentence><sentence id="1765">So, a base of this, it's very important not to forget.</sentence><sentence id="1766">I don't think it's too much, I do not think it's too much, because it's -- it's like Wiesel, the -- who got a Nobel prize, says, you have to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1767">I mean, because otherwise it will repeat itself.</sentence><sentence id="1768">It's not only for the Jewish people, it's for -- for the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: You know, when I think about <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span>, this is the first time -- I mean, nothing is perfect, but considering what Milosevitch was doing to these people, he was burying them, he was murdering them.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And I -- and it's fortunate that NATO, with the baking of - - backing of the United State, had the guts to do something about it, and I am not qualified to say it, but there is likely a likelihood, that the Holocaust of the -- of the people during World War Two, had some influence of -- of this engagement.</sentence><sentence id="1804">So we won't eradicate hatred, but we might work towards eradication of hatred.</sentence></p></dialogue>
