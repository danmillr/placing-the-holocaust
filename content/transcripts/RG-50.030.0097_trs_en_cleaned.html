<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> is the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">It is one of the six republics in today's <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">Uh, it had a population, Jewish population of 10,000 out of 200,000.</sentence><sentence id="18">Uh, and uh, it was uh, it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that resembles <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to some extent in its atmosphere because it was in the Austro- Hungarian part for so many centuries.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: Tell me about, what was it like for you.</sentence><sentence id="24">How, where did your family live, in what <span class="NPIP">part</span>, and was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span>?</sentence><sentence id="25">What was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: There was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: OK.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: There was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">There had never been any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="35">The Jews lived, uh, all over.</sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, we lived downtown in my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">My parents were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> already, but not my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="38">The Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> were strongly Zionist.</sentence><sentence id="39">And as far as the religious preference, they were...they practiced conservative Judaism.</sentence><sentence id="40">We were Ashkenazi, as opposed to the Sephardic Jews of <span class="REGION">eastern Yugoslavia</span>--in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span>, in Bosnia[- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hercegovina</span>], in <span class="COUNTRY">Montenegro</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">The total Jewish community of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> before the war was about 70,000.</sentence><sentence id="42">As I said, with very strong ties to <span class="REGION">Eretz Israel</span> at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="53">Q: What about your family?</sentence><sentence id="54">Who made up your, your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="57">A: I have no brothers or sisters.</sentence><sentence id="58">And uh, I never met my, uh, grandparents, except one grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="59">So it was just my parents and I. My father was, uh, an employee in an <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">We were middle-class, comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="61">There were no signs of overt antisemitism there.</sentence><sentence id="62">There was antisemitism but it was kept more or less under the surface; and especially in the main part of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>--in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span>--there was no anti-semitism, because the Jews embraced the idea of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> rather than separate nations.</sentence><sentence id="63">And so there was no government-sponsored antisemitism.</sentence><sentence id="64">However, a Jew could not become a professor in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, or get a government position or a high government position.</sentence><sentence id="65">This was understood.</sentence><sentence id="66">Unless you're baptized himself or herself.</sentence><sentence id="67">But otherwise, we were left alone.</sentence><sentence id="68">There was inter-marriage, and there were friendships with the, uh, gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="69">It was quite a comfortable life for the middle-class.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: What kind of a schooling did you have?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">We had in those days four years of elementary education which was sectarian.</sentence><sentence id="87">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> and then it was followed by eight years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, of <span class="BUILDING">European high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">I only finished six, because the war came.</sentence><sentence id="89">The Germans attacked when I was just finishing the sixth...uh, sixth year or sixth grade.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: What was that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> like?</sentence><sentence id="96">This was a <span class="BUILDING">secular high school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: This was a <span class="BUILDING">secular high school</span>, which had a very strict, fixed curriculum embracing all fields of science, at least three languages, uh, including Latin.</sentence><sentence id="100">There was Latin, French and German were obligatory, besides Serbo-Croatian.</sentence><sentence id="101">Religion was taught in separate classes to the Jews, the Catholics, the Moslems, the Orthodox, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="102">So religion was actually the main subject; and if you didn't pass religion, you didn't pass that whole year.</sentence><sentence id="103">It was typical European, the educational system.</sentence><sentence id="104">No mercy, no promotion--unless you really passed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="111">Q: Did you enjoy it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="113">A: Yes, I... enjoyed it; because I...I was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="114">I was a good student, so it wasn't too difficult for me.</sentence><sentence id="115">But this wasn't really a public education where everybody participated, like in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">Most of the population did not participate in this type of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">Uh, there was a high rate of illiteracy, and, uh, education was not at all wide-spread in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> of those days.</sentence><sentence id="118">So this was somewhat of an elite group that went to this type of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: You talked about there not being official antisemitism but that antisemitism was sort of felt.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="127">Did you encounter any such incidents when you were growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: I really didn't encounter any incident, except in sometimes perhaps a remark, uh, by a teacher who would meet us Jewish children going to our <span class="BUILDING">religion class</span>, to another <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">He would say something. "</sentence><sentence id="130">Here come the chosen people."</sentence><sentence id="131">It was sort of sarcastic, but it was...it was that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="132">Or, uh, if, uh, in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> sometimes children would shout, "Jew, go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="133">But I personally did not encounter any strong antisemitic, uh, incident.</sentence><sentence id="134">However, there was at least one group, and it's the main group.</sentence><sentence id="135">There was a political party, underground, a fascist party which was antisemitic.</sentence><sentence id="136">And they did write graffiti and publish slogans, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="137">And they were the Croatian Nationalist Separatists, who didn't want <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="138">They wanted independent <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>, <span class="REGION">Catholic Croatia</span>; and they were fiercely antisemitic.</sentence><sentence id="139">But they lived mostly in <span class="NPIP">exile</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">In the inter-war years, they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>--which <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> gave them asylum hoping that someday, as it happened, they could bring them back into <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and install them in this Croatian state, which would then be a satellite of the Axis powers.</sentence><sentence id="141">So there was always the underground; and it's a feeling of impending antisemitic, uh, doom.</sentence><sentence id="142">But in everyday life, it wasn't felt as much as it might have been in other parts of Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: What happened when the war broke out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: When the war broke out in 1939, <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was neutral.</sentence><sentence id="161">And uh, in 1940 <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and could not achieve a victory there.</sentence><sentence id="162"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> out of the way.</sentence><sentence id="163">In fact, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted the <span class="REGION">Balkans</span> secured; because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> planned to attack the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="164">The Germans pressured the Yugoslav government of the time to let German troops go through <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, so that they can then attack <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">The Yugoslav government agreed, but there was a coup which overthrew that government.</sentence><sentence id="166">This was in <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">An anti- Fascist, anti-Nazi coup; and they installed a new government which was openly anti- German.</sentence><sentence id="168">It was in defiance, direct defiance of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="169">And in response to that, in April 1941, he ordered that <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> be attacked.</sentence><sentence id="170"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> all attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and defeated its army in about fourteen days.</sentence><sentence id="171">And that Croatian state was then established under the name the "Independent State of Croatia."</sentence><sentence id="172">And the exiled nationalists, antisemites, came back to govern that <span class="COUNTRY">state</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">They called themselves "UstaSa."</sentence><sentence id="174">That means, uh, "Men of the Uprising."</sentence><sentence id="175">And immediately, within the first week, they began to introduce anti-Jewish legislation.</sentence><sentence id="176">Not only Jews, but also the Serbs.</sentence><sentence id="177">Orthodox Serbs were really on their list of destruction.</sentence><sentence id="178">And Gypsies.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Tell us what was in that legislation and how did it affect you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: The legislation was sweeping.</sentence><sentence id="201">The Jews, there was a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="202">The Jews had to wear a yellow, uh, piece of cloth on the shoulder and in the back with the, uh, word, with the initial for "Jew" in Yugoslav.</sentence><sentence id="203">They were, of course, thrown out of all jobs; and even out of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in a certain section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">They had to surrender cameras, radios, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="205">It was a preliminary, it was a set of measures to isolate the Jews and completely, uh, cow the Jewish population into numbness.</sentence><sentence id="206">Because it was very sudden.</sentence><sentence id="207">Almost upon arrival of these...of the <span class="BUILDING">UstaSa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And, selectively, they took certain groups--such as some lawyers--and executed them as being Communists.</sentence><sentence id="209">And they began some deportations.</sentence><sentence id="210">There...those were times, they were somewhat chaotic.</sentence><sentence id="211">I mean, it was a new state.</sentence><sentence id="212">There was chaos.</sentence><sentence id="213">The UstaSa were not that organized.</sentence><sentence id="214">There was a struggle between the Germans and Italians, diplomatic struggle, for the control of that state.</sentence><sentence id="215">And the Germans won that control.</sentence><sentence id="216">The Italians, who had banked on that, lost even though the Italians also got a piece of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">In other words, it is important to understand that after the victory over <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, the Axis powers dismembered <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">There was no more <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> as a state.</sentence><sentence id="219">There was the Independent State of Croatia; <span class="COUNTRY">Serbia</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>; <span class="REGION">western Yugoslavia</span>--that is, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovenia</span>--was divided between the Germans and Italians.</sentence><sentence id="220">And most important, for my story, the Italians occupied that Adriatic coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and most of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">They also annexed part of that <span class="DLF">coast</span>--the best part, the richest for tourism--<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span>, and made it part of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">So that was the situation.</sentence><sentence id="223">The Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> [were] being slowly herded together, and taken to various camps.</sentence><sentence id="224">At one time, there were some thirteen or fourteen camps operating in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">The Germans were not in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">This was all...they were all run by the UstaSa.</sentence><sentence id="227">The, uh, savagerity that was practiced in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was such that even the Germans were horrified.</sentence><sentence id="228">In their internal memoranda, they called it the "Balkan bestiality."</sentence><sentence id="229">At one point--I don't remember the exact date, in July that same year--a transport was being formed.</sentence><sentence id="230">In other words, again Jews were being arrested, to be transported to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> where they all perished.</sentence><sentence id="231">I was arrested on a certain day.</sentence><sentence id="232">And I was then sixteen at the time.</sentence><sentence id="233">The agent detective who came to arrest me, the Croatian, had my name on his list and not my father's name.</sentence><sentence id="234">This was unusual.</sentence><sentence id="235">And my father protested and said that it must be a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="236">He wanted to substitute himself for me, saying that "You probably mean me, and not my son."</sentence><sentence id="237">The detective insisted, "No, it says Ivo Herzer and I have to take him."</sentence><sentence id="238">So my father said, "Well, I'll come with you."</sentence><sentence id="239">Of course, he couldn't go into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transitory camp</span>; and so I was taken there.</sentence><sentence id="240">This was on the outskirts of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>, where fairs were held usually.</sentence><sentence id="241">And there were several hundred Jewish families with babies, complete families, pushed against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">And machine guns--heavy machine guns--were manned by the UstaSa, aimed at this mass of Jews who were...we had to respond to a roll call about every hour.</sentence><sentence id="243">We didn't know at all what would happen.</sentence><sentence id="244">Now we know what happened to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">As I said, they were taken to the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pag</span>, P - A - G; and they all perished there under horrible circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="246">I was just lucky; because during the evening roll call, when my name came up, the UstaSa officer in charge said, "Are you here alone?"</sentence><sentence id="247">Since they had families.</sentence><sentence id="248">I said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="249">He said, "Take your things and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>."</sentence><sentence id="250">Just like that.</sentence><sentence id="251">He could have easily said, "Bring his family."</sentence><sentence id="252">He didn't.</sentence><sentence id="253">Now this was past curfew time.</sentence><sentence id="254">I had no paper in my hand to prove that I had a right to be anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="255">And so I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; and I wasn't...no patrol found me.</sentence><sentence id="256">I was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="257">And my parents thought they had lost me already.</sentence><sentence id="258">And they couldn't believe their eyes when I just burst in upon them.</sentence><sentence id="259">It was then that my parents decided that we must do something.</sentence><sentence id="260">Try to escape.</sentence><sentence id="261">But escape where?</sentence><sentence id="262">The partisans were not yet active.</sentence><sentence id="263"><span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> was surrounded by <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that were already under German domination.</sentence><sentence id="264">How could we, ordinary middle-class people, escape?</sentence><sentence id="265">And then the decision was made.</sentence><sentence id="266">Let us try to somehow escape to the <span class="REGION">Italian zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">Maybe the Italians will let us in.</sentence><sentence id="268">Maybe they're not as bad as the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="269">Because we didn't really know anything about Fascist Italy.</sentence><sentence id="270">Since the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span> was oriented toward <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and the German-speaking Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was the place to go for a vacation maybe.</sentence><sentence id="271">But the fundamental difference between Fascism and Nazism, as far as Jews were concerned, was unknown to us.</sentence><sentence id="272">To us, this was a gamble.</sentence><sentence id="273">And my father obtained some sort of pass which could be gotten for some money.</sentence><sentence id="274">It was just a pass that said that we could be let out of <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>, but didn't guarantee any entry anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="275">With this pass, without the yellow signs--which was a great risk--we left in July 1941 by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">We wanted to go actually to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Split</span>--Spalato, in Italian--which then was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dalmatia</span>, which then became <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">And we thought if we reached that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> somehow, as many Jews did, we would be safe--provided the Italians don't turn us back.</sentence><sentence id="278">On the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spalato</span>, however, some troubles developed to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">It seems that some guerillas must have blown up the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was turned back; and we landed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which was the worst <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be.</sentence><sentence id="281">And this was the city of the Croatian Nationalists, where the UstaSa movement was born--the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gospi_--in</span> a desolate part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with curfews, patrols, and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for Jews just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gospi_.</span></sentence><sentence id="282">We didn't know that, but there it was.</sentence><sentence id="283">The three of us, plus perhaps six or seven other Jews whom we knew who tried to do the same thing, we coalesced into a small group, milling around at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then trying to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="285">On the way, we just knocked on a <span class="DLF">door</span>--the first <span class="BUILDING">peasant house</span> we saw.</sentence><sentence id="286">Fortunately, this was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> owned by an old Serb woman.</sentence><sentence id="287">And the Serbs were, at that time, again persecuted by the Croatians, just like the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="288">So she understood our plight.</sentence><sentence id="289">But she was afraid of harboring us.</sentence><sentence id="290">She said she could keep us only for so many hours.</sentence><sentence id="291">We sat there.</sentence><sentence id="292">We...we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not knowing what to do.</sentence><sentence id="293">We couldn't go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="45.817" long="15.983">Zagreb</span>.</sentence><sentence id="294">We couldn't go forward.</sentence><sentence id="295">We had false documents.</sentence><sentence id="296">We were lost.</sentence><sentence id="297">To all intents and purposes, it seemed a completely impossible situation.</sentence><sentence id="298">But again, we were lucky in that there was an Italian garrison in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>--as there were Italian garrisons all over the <span class="REGION">region</span> which was not far from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, from the <span class="DLF">coast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="299">At...we just ...we saw three Italian soldiers, or maybe four.</sentence><sentence id="300">I spoke a little Italian, almost nothing; and my father a little, because he took Italian in his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> days.</sentence><sentence id="301">We just approached these soldiers, just on the wild chance that they might help us.</sentence><sentence id="302">And we told them two words: "ebrei"--which means Jews, [and] "paura"--fear.</sentence><sentence id="303">They immediately understood, because they knew what was going on--as we now know.</sentence><sentence id="304">And they told us to quickly go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, "calma"--calm, and they would bring their sergeant.</sentence><sentence id="305">Their sergeant came.</sentence><sentence id="306">He spoke some French, and uh, we...we knew French.</sentence><sentence id="307">It was easier to communicate.</sentence><sentence id="308">He said, "Stay here.</sentence><sentence id="309">I'll see if I can get maybe a pass for you, to get you into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>."</sentence><sentence id="310">And he left.</sentence><sentence id="311">We didn't believe him.</sentence><sentence id="312">We thought he just said nice things.</sentence><sentence id="313">How would he, who is he, didn't want any money.</sentence><sentence id="314">He never knew us, but he came back.</sentence><sentence id="315">He said he couldn't get a pass for us;

food.</sentence><sentence id="578">Uh, there were two things that stand out.</sentence><sentence id="579">One, that two weeks roughly I think after our arrival in <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1346">Q: Did your parents come with you, and how?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1348">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1349">That was probably the worst thing, uh, in our lives.</sentence><sentence id="1350">That we were together during the war, and could not really be together afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1351">Because they were...applied for, on a quota, for a visa to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>; and, uh, there was a spot on my father's lungs.</sentence><sentence id="1352">And an American doctor said this is TB.</sentence><sentence id="1353">And from that moment on--no matter what other doctors said or what other tests were conducted showing that it's a dead process, not an active process, because my father was a heavy smoker--that original decision could not be rescinded.</sentence><sentence id="1354">But my mother was forced to come here so she would not loose her <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1355">She came in 1949 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1356">Had to leave him there.</sentence><sentence id="1357">In 1949, he was already 66 years old; and he could never get this entry visa, even though later on he came as a visitor.</sentence><sentence id="1358">My mother went there from back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1359">By that time, they had no more money.</sentence><sentence id="1360">They had no more way; you know, it was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> here, and so they were getting some help from, uh, United Nations refugee organization, UNRRA.</sentence><sentence id="1362">But we had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and they told them to come.</sentence><sentence id="1363">So they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1954.</sentence><sentence id="1364">And I became a citizen here in 1955, and so I was able to then leave and go and visit them.</sentence><sentence id="1365">But, uh, those were great efforts.</sentence><sentence id="1366">And I tried to... You know, the x-ray pictures were sent to me; and I showed them to doctors here, and they were all unanimous and said, "No, this is obviously not an open process.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And even if it were, so what?</sentence><sentence id="1368">I mean, the man can be put into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in under observation."</sentence><sentence id="1369">But they wouldn't let him in.</sentence><sentence id="1370">This was part of a...at that time, of an effort to let as few Jews in as possible; which according to ...which is...which was true according to, uh, research that was done much later.</sentence><sentence id="1371">I myself came under the displaced persons law, because I came as a student.</sentence><sentence id="1372">Even that was not easy, because for me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I had to have a student visa.</sentence><sentence id="1373">I couldn't get an immigrant's visa, because I...my...my number wasn't up.</sentence><sentence id="1374">To get a student's visa, you have to have a national passport.</sentence><sentence id="1375">So that if you commit a crime, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> can send you back.</sentence><sentence id="1376">But I had no national passport.</sentence><sentence id="1377">I had to renounce my Yugoslav citizenship.</sentence><sentence id="1378">I was stateless.</sentence><sentence id="1379">How can you then get a student visa?</sentence><sentence id="1380">So again, the Italians said, "Well, we'll give you a statement that we will let you into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> if the Americans push you out."</sentence><sentence id="1381">And that should convince the <span class="BUILDING">Consul</span> that he could give me the visa; which they did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1416">Q: So you came here.</sentence><sentence id="1417">You went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1426">Q: As an engineer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1428">A: As an engineer.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And then got other degrees at night; which was for many years I got the Master's, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1430">And then slowly thinking and rethinking all those events, I became more and more interested in--not only my past, but in this aspect of the...the rescue.</sentence><sentence id="1431">The...the Italian story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1436">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="1437">It's quite a story.</sentence><sentence id="1438">Ivo, I'd like to back up a minute.</sentence><sentence id="1439">The island-hopping you did in order to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1440">Can you describe it in a little more detail?</sentence><sentence id="1441">Uh, we don't uh... Did people take out <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sailboats</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1442">Did you do this at night?</sentence><sentence id="1443">How was this done?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1452">A: This was mostly...mostly small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor boats</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sail boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1453">Mostly.</sentence><sentence id="1454">It's all I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1455">There were maybe five or six <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>, when I was island-hopping, before the big one.</sentence><sentence id="1456">I remember, on one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> we were so...we were tired.</sentence><sentence id="1457">We somehow found our way to...to the local teachers--a married couple.</sentence><sentence id="1458">They gave us their <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> to use for that night.</sentence><sentence id="1459">I don't know how, because I was not involved.</sentence><sentence id="1460">It was all, again, in the hands of, you know, my father.</sentence><sentence id="1461">There was always a leader in a group; because we were a part of a small group of people.</sentence><sentence id="1462">And then there was another group and they came to the same <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span>, and so you have a group, so to say, travelling.</sentence><sentence id="1463">And the last big hop to the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span>, where the British were, there we had a big boat--70-ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1464">And, uh, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was very bad, and there were too many of us.</sentence><sentence id="1465">It was awful.</sentence><sentence id="1466">What they did is, they left the older people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span>; and us, the younger ones, they lashed us with ropes on the...uh on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span>, so we wouldn't be washed away by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was mined; but the <span class="DLF">mines</span> were much deeper than this small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, relatively small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1468">Seventy tons is not very big.</sentence><sentence id="1469">So we were also safe that way.</sentence><sentence id="1470">And I actually, again, profited by that; because being out in fresh air, even though there were waves and it was scary, but I didn't get so sick as the people down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1471">But I don't have any clear specific, you know, incident to relate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1492">Q: And you have no sense of how this was organized, or how it was done?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1494">A: It was done... No, it was done on a day-by-day.</sentence><sentence id="1495">There was no...that we would <span class="DLF">line</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1496">So the man who, the local fisherman or someone, who brought us there would be paid; and we...we tried to sleep somewhere on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, or some <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1497">And then, maybe, find somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="1498">Again, we have some money or clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1499">I remember, we gave some clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1500">In fact, my Bar Mitzvah blue suit was given away, I think, on one of these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span>--as a contribution which was more important than money; because money really didn't mean much at that rate.</sentence><sentence id="1501">People, again, wanted clothes, gold, food and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1502">But I don't have any specifics; recollections of an interesting incident.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1512">Q: When the British interned you, as it were, uh, again... How... You never, in fact, got taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1513">You were...you were... what was that like?</sentence><sentence id="1514">You were under the British control.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1520">A: We were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1522">Q: What was that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like?</sentence><sentence id="1523">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">British camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1526">A: We were housed in <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> and abandoned <span class="BUILDING">villas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1527">We slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">stone floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1528">Uh, it was typical refugee, refugee-type situation.</sentence><sentence id="1529">You know, if you can imagine the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>... When people are evacuated--the disaster, you know, make-shift quarters.</sentence><sentence id="1530">But we were fed.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Uh, and I don't know how many people there were; but I think this was a pretty large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1532">It wasn't only Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1533">In fact, mostly non-Jewish refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1534">Uh, we heard--but we were not told, we heard-- this is in rumors, that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was destined for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">El Saff</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1535">That was the place somewhere outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1536">And I remember my father said, "No.</sentence><sentence id="1537">Not one more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1538">If we can get out of here, let's get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="1539">Somehow we will be able to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1540">Because uh again, this wasn't something that we knew, but we felt it's...it's possible.</sentence><sentence id="1541">It will be possible to make a...to exist, rather than in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1542">Only proved to be true.</sentence><sentence id="1543">But we had no contact with the outside world.</sentence><sentence id="1544">Although there was... I'm sure that many things were going on; and Jewish organizations might have been active, the Italian-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1545">I didn't know, I did not know that.</sentence><sentence id="1546">I was still a little dizzy.</sentence><sentence id="1547">I was... END OF VIDEOTAPE ... Well, the main thought is that I'm glad now that, uh, that the Italian contribution to the rescue is now becoming known.</sentence><sentence id="1548">Even though it involved few people, compared to the tremendous tragedy of the Jewish nation.</sentence><sentence id="1549">Still, there were so few positive episodes in the Holocaust that this one had to be recorded, made known.</sentence><sentence id="1550">And I'm glad now that I see that books are coming out and articles, research is being done; that this is finally, after 40 years, becoming known.</sentence></p></dialogue>
