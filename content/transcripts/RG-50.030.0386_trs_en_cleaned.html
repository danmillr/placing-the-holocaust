<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: In all honesty, I -- I mean it's -- I don't think I resented the inconveniences of being Jewish at that time, having to walk across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> all the time to get kosher meat and the -- but I -- I certainly observed the dietary laws.</sentence><sentence id="111">I just didn't eat at anybody else's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I -- and except for this close friend that I've been friends with from -- Joe Platt and I met as friends in the seventh grade, in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">We went all through <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">college</span> together, the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">But whenever -- when -- when I went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a meal, which was the first time I ever ate anywhere else, his mother was very careful to give me -- give us a dairy meal, dairy foods, she just -- she realized I could not eat traifa food.</sentence><sentence id="114">But -- yeah, I had good friends, like Joe Platt, primarily Joe Platt and then I formed -- I did not join the Jewish fraternity at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Rochester</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">There was only one.</sentence><sentence id="116">And -- and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>, first to Michigan for one year, <span class="BUILDING">Michigan Law School</span> in "37, "38 and then to <span class="BUILDING">Yale Law School</span>, [indecipherable] graduated.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: We're jumping ahead a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="206">I want -- I want to ask you a couple questions.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: Just quickly back to the AFS.</sentence><sentence id="212">Were you -- when you were driving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span>, were you able to observe anything about what was going on in the war, or about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, anything like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Really only once.</sentence><sentence id="216">We met a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivor on a <span class="DLF">road</span>, he had wandered off by himself and his head was shaven and -- this is while I'm driving an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>, before I've gone to work for the JDC.</sentence><sentence id="217">And I think he'd -- I'm not sure whether he was still wearing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> pajamas, but then we -- when I went to work for the JDC, of course, that was in the early days after the war and that was -- those first -- those six months between May -- if that's when I went to work for the JDC, in -- no, we said I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="218">In July of "45, I went back int-into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and worked at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> until - - which was this first Jewish all DP camp, until December, "45 and there -- there were some very, very emotional experiences.</sentence><sentence id="219">People did not know, initially, that their families had been decimated.</sentence><sentence id="220">They were separated.</sentence><sentence id="221">People who could work were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">Nobody knew yet about the -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> or even the full extent of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I remember one man in particular who had just learned about what had happened to his family and I was there in this JDC uniform, which was like a military uniform and I was good, strong physical condition and I remember his walking up to me, with tears, he had just learned apparently, about what had happened to his family.</sentence><sentence id="224">And he said to me in Yiddish, "Dusha svair itsa zine a Yid."</sentence><sentence id="225">It is hard to be a Jew and -- with tears flowing down his face.</sentence><sentence id="226">That was -- I met, I'm sure -- I mean, stationed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>, I met a lot of people, but in those early days, when it was just being learned by these people who had been separated, that they -- their families had been liquidated, that became a very emotional kind of period to work -- to be working with those people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: How much did you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: I don't think I knew much.</sentence><sentence id="242">I mean, I had driven the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> and I'd met this one guy, who -- who mentioned something about what had happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="243">And then I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and people began their -- come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and we learned from some of them, what had been happening.</sentence><sentence id="244">The awareness of what had been done by the Germans to the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, did not take place until sometime after the war.</sentence><sentence id="245">There just wasn't the communication, there wasn't the information and -- course the average German said he didn't know, she didn't know about it either.</sentence><sentence id="246">But there were relatives who must have come back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> who must have told them what Hitler was doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: I'm going to stop the tape here, because we need to change the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: As much -- you know, I -- I'm stopping you because there's much o-of this sort of personal detail, you think it's really helpful?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: Well I -- I've been... Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Okay, we were starting to talk a little bit about your work with the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">And I have a couple questions I'd like to throw out and then sort of let you --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: -- tell me.</sentence><sentence id="269">The first is, what your primary responsibilities were there.</sentence><sentence id="270">What, you know, what kind of work you were involved in, cause I know they -- they were trying to accomplish a lot and also what -- what credentials you had or what experience you had for the kind of work that you would be doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Well my only credentials were that A -- I knew something about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because I'd been driving an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> there and we would be sending people in to work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and the JDC initially had nobody in parts -- those parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or even in the northern -- the British occupied parts.</sentence><sentence id="275">So I -- I certainly could be helpful in the red tape of getting somebody into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and -- and then we had dealings with the French-Jewish community and I had fairly good command of French, I had had a lot of French in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I -- when I drove an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> for the first French army, we spoke a lot of French, so that was kind of -- but I think mainly there was nobody else for them to hire and they desperately needed people for whatever programs they could organize.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: And then sort of let you --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="910">A: Well, yes.</sentence><sentence id="911">I -- I didn't feel that I could comply with the wishes of this West Point Lieutenant Colonel or if that -- to send out an official statement as a representative of the JDC, that all was well, or that things had greatly improved.</sentence><sentence id="912">I said, "That's something -- th-that's only something that the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> would authorize," and to give the impression that all -- th-this could be interpreted as meaning that the army had discharged it's responsibilities and all was well, when in fact that was not true.</sentence><sentence id="913">And the army -- I -- I was never critical of the army, I felt th-they were simply not equipped, not trained to be relief workers, particularly for this unprecedented situation of highly -- the people were distraught, as they were beginning to realize what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="914">And they were unwilling to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, they -- some of them immediately started to do black marketing and we had a situation in which -- a friend of mine, later he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, I -- I don't think he's a-around any more, who was one of the people -- he was a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> the people elected their own camp committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="915">Elected them, picked them or somehow.</sentence><sentence id="916">People who were going to be there for awhile and Joe Lifshitz, who later came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> had it -- was a member of that committee and the -- and they acquired -- I think they -- some guns or something.</sentence><sentence id="917">They -- as a police organization they had to have some -- some firearms.</sentence><sentence id="918">And the army somehow learned that these difficult people or -- had armaments and they raided <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span> in the middle of the night, rousted everybody out, to find these armaments.</sentence><sentence id="919">And they arrested these several people who were on the camp committee and it was so stupid, I mean it was so reminiscent of what these people had suffered under -- under the -- the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="920">And -- and then to arrest some of them for having unauthorized -- I remembered there was a military judge, a military government or an army judge, before whom they were brought and I went with them to this judge, who was a very decent man and I -- I said, "Look, 1 your honor, this is ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="921">You know, these people are our friends, they're our allies."</sentence><sentence id="922">And -- you know, he -- he -- he immediately agreed and he discharged them, but the army had been so stupid in arresting these people and treating them as though they were just like some Germans who were somehow violating the regulations.</sentence><sentence id="923">And -- so that was something -- one -- one instance.</sentence><sentence id="924">But I was -- there was this Major Fisher at -- third army.</sentence><sentence id="925">Eisen -- Patton's army was the famous third army and they -- their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and they had -- th-th-they were in charge of -- of these <span class="REGION">areas</span> where these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were and f -- I went over to this guy, Major Fisher, in Patton's <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, who was presumably in charge of this sort of thing and I said, "Look, can't you do something to relieve the overcrowding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>?</sentence><sentence id="926">It's terrible.</sentence><sentence id="927">The -- after what these people have been through."</sentence><sentence id="928">And I'd been driving through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> to try to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that -- a <span class="DLF">farm</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span> or something that could be used and there is this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span> -- what did I -- did I say there was another name for it?</sentence><sentence id="929">Did I mention that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: [inaudible] hausen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: Anyway, which is not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>, which is a series of small <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and whatnot, which the -- the Germans had used for, I think army people and the -- there were Polish officers, or members -- Poles, who had somehow taken control of that and were living there.</sentence><sentence id="953">And -- and it was outrageous that these Poles, many of whom had fled because of their -- not only bec -- some because they didn't want to live under the Russians, but others because they were afraid they'd be made to pay for their anti-Jewish and whatnot actions under the Nazis -- their collaborations.</sentence><sentence id="954">And -- and I -- I said to Fisher, "Can't we use this Wulfratshausen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">c-camp</span>, with it's wonderful facilities, to siphon off this overcrowding at -- at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="955">And he brushed me aside and whatnot.</sentence><sentence id="956">Then came the day when Eisenhower and Patton were visiting and there was the conversation where Eisenhower -- where they saw the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> without bases.</sentence><sentence id="957">And we were walking away and they were talking about how overcrowded it was and this f -- that was when I heard Fisher for the first time say, "Oh, by the way generals, we're about to relieve this overcrowding by this new Jewish displaced person's camp, which we are just opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span>."</sentence><sentence id="958">And that was -- up to then he had firmly refused to entertain that idea and I-I heard it for the first time when he felt that he had a problem and he'd better try to do something to protect himself.</sentence><sentence id="959">So that was something I did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="968">Q: Now, at this -- at this point in time, was Feldifing mixed Jewish and non-Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="970">A: No, no, it -- it became all Jewish fairly -- fairly soon after -- oh, I don't know, after the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="971">The -- it was just so plain that you couldn't keep them in -- Jews and non-Jews together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="972">First because of the Jewish needs and second because of the hostility the Jews felt towards the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="973">They -- and they, as I say -- and many of those Poles included people who had come voluntarily to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work for the Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="980">Q: So this happened before Eisenhower came over there?</sentence><sentence id="981">He came in September.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="984">A Of "45.</sentence><sentence id="985">Yeah, I sus -- well, but it was in this visit by Eisenhower and Patton, where Fisher, for the first time, mentioned that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span> was now going to be used for Jewish DP's, but when were the Polish DP's moved out?</sentence><sentence id="986">Somewhere around that time.</sentence><sentence id="987">It -- it was just clear you couldn't kee -- I think they were only together for a short time after the war in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="988">I-It was very clear you couldn't keep them --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="994">Q: And it was Jewish DP's who were moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wulfratshausen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="998">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="999">What other improvements do you think were a result of the Eisenhower visit?</sentence><sentence id="1000">Or of the Harrison report for that matter?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1004">A: Ah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1005">I -- I spoke to Earl Harrison, a Philadelphian and connected with Wilosco, I believe, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Penn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1006">On his way -- he and Joe Schwartz made this visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the period after the war and they stopped off at the <span class="BUILDING">JDC office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, where I was then located and I -- I think I -- well, Schwartz didn't -- I had some meeting with -- with Harrison where I -- I think I told him what to -- or suggested what to look for and just told him whatever I could, whatever he might ask me about his forthcoming visit.</sentence><sentence id="1007">Now it was that visit that -- was that where they recommended that X number of people be sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1008">Was that -- yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1009">But I only saw him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, I did not -- either it was before I'd gone back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or after I'd come out, I've forgotten when, but I definitely spoke to him in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, on his way into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1010">The --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1018">Q: I'm trying to get a sense of the impact of both Harrison's visit and Eisenhower's visit and how it enabled you to make some improvements, if -- if at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1020">A: Yeah, I don't think -- I don't know, I don't think the Harrison visit, as such, made a difference.</sentence><sentence id="1021">But the Eisenhower visit did, because it was right after the Eisenhower visit that this -- oh, what was his name -- this colonel -- this Texas fighting officer came in and said -- to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said, "My career is in the army, I -- I've fought valiantly in -- in the war and now my reputation is being jeopardized by this criticism of these conditions in my <span class="REGION">area</span> -- in my <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And -- tell me what I should do -- tell me what I can do.</sentence><sentence id="1023">I -- I -- I don't want this hang -- this hanging over me or ruining my record and I-I'1l do whatever I can."</sentence><sentence id="1024">And -- and I f -- I can't remember what I told him precisely.</sentence><sentence id="1025">I guess he did not have any supplies, but I -- it was -- it was a friendly meeting, I sympathized with him.</sentence><sentence id="1026">He hadn't been trained for this sort of thing and -- and I sympathized with Patton too.</sentence><sentence id="1027">I mean these were my friends, they had fought the Nazis and I didn't want to see them -- and I just felt they weren't trained for this sort of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1036">Q: So when he said, "What can I do to keep my reputation intact," what -- what did you say?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1040">A: I -- I must have said, "Well, if there's any way you can help us get more supplies and to create more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to relieve the overcrowding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Feldifing</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1041">And I know I traveled around.</sentence><sentence id="1042">I went th-through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> at that point, looking for a possible place that we could set up another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and the -- and I -- this parenthetically, I would stop at military government officers -- offices, through these other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, not just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and in one of them, the military government officer in charge of this question was R.W. Fleming, Robin W.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1056">Q: What -- you had mentioned <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> activities.</sentence><sentence id="1057">Was there a lot of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1060">A: Oh, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1061">The -- there was a lot of it by everybody, but -- in that -- in the post- war period.</sentence><sentence id="1062">The -- there were Jews living in regular -- out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, they had managed to establish themselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and -- where they had some money and they didn't -- if you could avoid living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, you of course, did and there were these people living in <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and whatnot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and for awhile we had an -- a <span class="BUILDING">JDC office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunenstrasser</span> -- K-a-u-n.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1076">A: No and I don't know how -- oh, I'm sure the army made efforts and there may have been some arrests I didn't know about.</sentence><sentence id="1077">I -- I wasn't in charge of all -- of all of the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Bavaria</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1584">A: Around "47, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1585">That's -- and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> from "47 to "51 or so, working for the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on various things, including the Claims Committee.</sentence><sentence id="1586">The people -- did I describe that, the -- the -- there were, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, I think that I must have started this -- there were people who had jewelry, who had dollars and the JDC, under Gussic had a program in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1587">What had been in the JDC program in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war and Gussic borrowed from -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gussic</span> and -- to bring in supplies and things for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1588">Needed money, needed -- and he would borrow jewelry and money and whatnot from people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so he could bring in supplies from outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and -- but he owed those people and after the war, there were people who had some sort of writing -- wh -- they came to the <span class="BUILDING">JDC</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and they said, "My uncle or my brother or I loaned money to the JDC in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> that -- and I was glad to do it, I could get -- I felt safe I'd be paid -- repaid someday," and w -- but we couldn't just automatically honor every claim, people could -- there could be fraud, so we set up a -- the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> set up a Claims Committee, and I, as the JDC's counsel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, worked with that Claims Committee.</sentence><sentence id="1589">And that was an interesting experience --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1596">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1597">Let's change the tape and then let you continue.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1610">Q: Through the -- through the Joint.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1612">A: That was a really interesting experience.</sentence><sentence id="1613">The -- the JDC had borrowed, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, Gussic and his --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1616">Q: All right, you -- actually you had explained this, so --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1618">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1619">All right, so now we have to pay back these loans and the records are poor and the JDC in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is beginning to get requests for repayment, either by the people that loaned the money directly, or the jewelry or whatnot, or relatives, and relatives who -- who only heard that their father or brother or uncle had loaned something to the JDC, they had nothing in writing.</sentence><sentence id="1620">Those relatives had died and they just felt that while they were glad to make contributions and so forth, to the United Jewish Appeal, if these were loans, it was supposed to be repaid, as was promised at the time, they would like to have repayments.</sentence><sentence id="1621">The Joint in New York recognized the validity of that position, but it wasn't about to give away stuff or recognize fraudulent claims.</sentence><sentence id="1622">So it appointed a Claims Commission.</sentence><sentence id="1623">The chairman's name escapes me at the moment, but there was a chairman and I think two people, one of them a lawyer -- Saul -- Saul something was the chairman.</sentence><sentence id="1624">I got the first name.</sentence><sentence id="1625">And I worked with them, I was then the JDC's house counsel.</sentence><sentence id="1626">I had come back, I wasn't ready to go back -- come back to my old career and I wanted to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and so Moe Levitt hired me and he needed -- he -- my legal background was attractive to him because the JDC was just now getting into restitution and reparations and he felt that having a lawyer in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">JDC headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> would be a good idea and I -- I -- I wanted to s-stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, for whatever the reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1627">And for about -- I think four years, that I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, from "47 to "51, I worked for the JDC and th-the Claims Committee was one of the as -- working with the Claims Committee was one aspect of my work for the JDC and it -- it was really an interesting, challenging kind of -- what do you do?</sentence><sentence id="1628">You've got -- you know you borrowed from people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, you know that you offered to repay them and yet here are people without proof, they only heard from their relatives or they had -- they had -- th -- there was not -- know diday were no records and so we set up this Claims Committee.</sentence><sentence id="1629">Saul -- Saul what's his name and somebody named Stuart, to constitute a Claims Commission to pass on these claims.</sentence><sentence id="1630">And we interviewed people, we looked at whatever records and I did -- I was sort of the staff person for that committee.</sentence><sentence id="1631">And -- and we paid back some claims.</sentence><sentence id="1632">Not in full, it was -- sorry -- number usually partial payment.</sentence><sentence id="1633">But these were legitimate claims and at the same time, we had to be protected against 5 unverifiable or fraudulent claims.</sentence><sentence id="1634">So I did that with the JDC for just -- I don't know how long.</sentence><sentence id="1635">When I was just living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1654">Q: And then did that -- did that than grow into a larger restitution organization?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1656">A: Well, then --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1658">Q: Wait a minute.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1660">A: Then, separately, there was this restitution program.</sentence><sentence id="1661">The -- as though -- programs were set up for claims by -- from the Germans, to property th-that had been taken away by the Germans and the allies set up s -- 1 mean the Americans, the British were less interested in it, I think and I don't remember what the Russians had -- we had four powers, but the Americans did something to help people claim back either what the Germans had confiscated or which they had left behind.</sentence><sentence id="1662">And then there was the whole business of what do you do with heirless Jewish property left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1663">That were -- these were -- this was property that was going to remain in the hands of the Germans, if the su -- nothing was done and it would remain in the hands in those cases, where the Germans had been most successful in destroying the Jews, because there were no heirs.</sentence><sentence id="1664">So where they had been most successful, they would be rewarded by retaining the property.</sentence><sentence id="1665">Well, obviously this was unacceptable, so an organization was created, called the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, to reclaim heirless Jewish property in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1666">Meant primarily the American occupied areas of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1667">And I worked with earso as we called it, as did Mikania Robinson, who was with the World Jewish Congress, stationed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1668">The two of us really did the organizing of that program and then in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, Benjamin Firenze, who had re-remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the Nuremberg Trials, where he had worked with Maxwell Taylor.</sentence><sentence id="1669">Ben either went back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="1670">And he undertook a program to find heirless Jewish property in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1671">And -- and then we made claims for the -- the heirless property in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, which is only recently surfaced.</sentence><sentence id="1672">I'm -- I don't know why, I don't re-remember the details.</sentence><sentence id="1673">But I was -- I definitely worked with the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization.</sentence><sentence id="1674">I helped establish it with Mikania Robinson and in the State Department recognized it as -- which didn't come easy, some of the old line State Department types did not like the idea, but this became the official Jewish Restitution Successor Organization for heirless Jewish property that was unclaimed, anyplace.</sentence><sentence id="1675">And it was used to -- the proceeds were used for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1676">Now, the Swiss have recently -- what is it that the Swiss have done recently?</sentence><sentence id="1677">They've just recently acknowledged that there is heirless Jewish property in their hands, that the Jews who were being deported and whatnot, people transferred their assets to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and no one ever claimed them because their families were wiped out and there were no records and the Swiss, I think, had hoped just to keep it, because there were no claimants and now there is some sort of effort.</sentence><sentence id="1678">But the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization did not -- I don't think -- function in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, it just functioned in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1679">And Benjamin Firenze ran the program from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and I ran it from the <span class="BUILDING">JDC offices</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1680">I -- I worked on it with Robinson.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1704">Q: You're fairly successful at recovering?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1706">A: Oh, I don't know, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1707">We -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Firenze</span> did, I'm sure, a great job of finding heirless Jewish property.</sentence><sentence id="1708">Ha -- it's a needle in a haystack, in a sense.</sentence><sentence id="1709">I mean, how do -- you have records, I guess, but who were the -- the Jewish -- in heirless cases, there was -- I mean, if there were any relatives who had claims, you had something to go on, but without heirs, I just don't remember how he -- he operated, how he found property, but he found property.</sentence><sentence id="1710">And the odinor government was -- I mean that was -- h-he was a good person and they cooperated in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1711">The -- but I -- I -- I'm not su -- seven hundred million dollars, does that sound right for the value of the heirless Jewish property?</sentence><sentence id="1712">Most of which was used for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, I'm pretty sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1720">Q: Must have been hard to corroborate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1722">A: These claims, oh, yeah, the -- for the claims countenfrance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1724">Q: No, even for the heirless.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1727">The -- it was a hit and miss sort of thing, as I recall, but gee, I'm not too clear on the details of -- of earso.</sentence><sentence id="1728">Firenze would -- would have a -- he -- did you say he's been interviewed?</sentence><sentence id="1729">Yeah, he would certainly know more about that.</sentence><sentence id="1730">And there was a guy that worked with him who later took my job at the -- succeeded me at the Joint in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaden</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kazen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1731">Can't remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1740">A: Oh, he's -- he's great.</sentence><sentence id="1741">I'd love to see him.</sentence><sentence id="1742">He was extremely able, very bright and energetic.</sentence><sentence id="1743">A little guy, he's oh, about five two or so and -- but much bigger, in reality.</sentence><sentence id="1744">And I guess he's practicing law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> or -- years ago I had some contact with him, but we've had no -- no reason to be in contact with each other.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Wonderful, wonderful person.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1752">Q: Let me ask you, sort of on a personal level.</sentence><sentence id="1753">The impact all these experiences have had on you, have they changed you?</sentence><sentence id="1754">Did they change you, I should say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1758">A: Well, at the time, I-I certainly don't -- they caused this strong re-identification with my background, my heritage.</sentence><sentence id="1759">I'm a pretty proud Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1760">I mean I think we have a wonderful history and I'm very happy to be part of it.</sentence><sentence id="1761">The -- go back these thousands of years and we've survived, we haven't disappeared in -- in the general population.</sentence><sentence id="1762">And I think the Orthodox Jews deserve most of the credit for that, during long periods when the -- that was the only f-faith.</sentence><sentence id="1763">And they went through a heck of a lot.</sentence><sentence id="1764">I'm not observant, I -- but I -- I feel very strongly my identification.</sentence><sentence id="1765">I'm proud of it and my kids -- well I -- I mean my grandchildren got Bar Mitzvahed, my son celeb-celebrates the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="1766">My two 7 daughters certainly are very clear in their identification.</sentence><sentence id="1767">My oldest son is just a wandering minstrel type.</sentence><sentence id="1768">I mean he doesn't really have any identification, but -- and -- and -- I think it's -- I mean we -- we could have done with fewer Holocaust, but it's absolutely remarkable the way this group gets up from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and continues to battle for it's survival and existence and -- and takes pride in being part of this extraordinary tradition.</sentence><sentence id="1769">It would have been much easier to disappear and fewer people would have died.</sentence><sentence id="1770">But I think the world would be a lot poorer if there were no Jews left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1784">Q: After you finished your work with the Joint, did you go back into labor relations?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1800">A: First "m -- you know, I'm very pleased that you are doing what you're doing.</sentence><sentence id="1801">I -- I mean, too many things of historical significance get lost and certainly the personal experiences of people like myself get lost.</sentence><sentence id="1802">And I've done a -- a certain amount of memoir keeping, but it -- it's -- it's inadequate coverag -- I'm trying to cover my whole life and there a whole lot of people who -- whose experiences may be lost.</sentence><sentence id="1803">I -- I was thinking of the -- the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, they -- are they -- is there still a Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1804">I guess there is.</sentence><sentence id="1805">The current leaders -- but I'1l -- Ill always remember that experience.</sentence><sentence id="1806">I'm lucky to have had these experiences.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1850">A: I don't think I've ever -- I certainly had a generalized hatred of -- of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1851">But even - - even though I've been critical of German apathy, I mean Germans claim they didn't know what Hitler was doing -- the ones who were not, the Germans who were not actively involved in the Holocaust, I've -- I've doubted that.</sentence><sentence id="1852">I mean, I didn't know how they could not have known of what was happening and they just chose to ignore it.</sentence><sentence id="1853">I mean it would have -- to overthrow Hitler would have been a difficult thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="1854">He had all the marbl -- all the arms and so I -- I -- I don't know whether I, if I were a German living under Hitler, whether I would have been willing to risk my life to overthrow him because I didn't like what he was doing to minorities.</sentence><sentence id="1855">But I still have sort of -- no I don't really hate the Germans any more.</sentence><sentence id="1856">I did in those early days, I hated every German I saw.</sentence><sentence id="1857">Even German children that I would see in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, I -- I would say, I mean there's, you know, a future Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="1858">It just was a blind hatred that made no sense and I've gotten over that a long time ago.</sentence><sentence id="1859">The -- but I think there are people who -- Jews today who won't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, isn't that right?</sentence><sentence id="1860">I mean they -- they"!</sentence><sentence id="1861">never forgive, even though three generations are -- and certainly Germans have been helpful in ways.</sentence></p></dialogue>
