<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="343">It was very clear it had to do with our so-called profession; watchmaker.</sentence><sentence id="344">One bought the watch and said, "I don't know what to do, my watch goes and all of the sudden doesn't go.</sentence><sentence id="345">Then I shake it, it goes.</sentence><sentence id="346">Then I don't shake it, it doesn't go.</sentence><sentence id="347">So I have to shake it all the time and I cannot go shaking my watch all over the time.</sentence><sentence id="348">So therefore, it's a dirty Jew sold me this watch and he knew it wasn't good."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: Were there any other laws that pertained?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="426">Q: So you studied throughout <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: All of the time.</sentence><sentence id="429">Because the <span class="BUILDING">school system</span> there is from 8 to 12.</sentence><sentence id="430">And 8 to 12 you learn the violin.</sentence><sentence id="431">After 12 you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you have the lesson.</sentence><sentence id="432">And -- and this was very pleasant because it's only four hours.</sentence><sentence id="433">So it was all right.</sentence><sentence id="434">Sure you learned other disciplines like arithmetic and what you have to learn.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="442">Q: You were taking the violin in addition to your --</sentence></p></dialogue>
