<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gabriele D.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3">Schiff, conducted by Amy Rubin, on July 27, 2000, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span>, New York.</sentence><sentence id="4">This is tape number one, side A. Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me your name at birth, and when and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Gabriele D. Schiff.</sentence><sentence id="6">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, on October fifth, 1914.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Could you tell me briefly about your family, and about your home life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I was born to a physician and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="12">We had a very assimilated home life.</sentence><sentence id="13">I was the youngest of four children.</sentence><sentence id="14">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, as far as I could get in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">It was all under the Whymar Republic, which of course, 1933, was taken over by Hitler, and my schooling, at least my formal schooling, came to an end.</sentence><sentence id="16">And at that time, one had to think slowly, about preparation for leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">I was about 16 at the time, and it was a very difficult <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and the most uneasy time for Jews, but an e -- uneasy time for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, all around.</sentence><sentence id="18">Vesters, strikes, and on the whole, you are looking how to create a future.</sentence><sentence id="19">My first job, as I always wanted to be a social worker, from my seventh year on, I became a secretary in a Jewish girl's orphanage.</sentence><sentence id="20">And at that time, it became clear that the girls who had no German passports, mostly of them Polish orphans, would be sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">It was partly my job to help prepare the children for a life that we really couldn't foresee, but it certainly meant separation, separation from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> they knew, as well as if they had relatives, separation from relatives, into the unknown.</sentence><sentence id="22">I have done that about a year, and then decided to better learn <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, prepare --</sentence><sentence id="24">English -- to prepare for eventual immigration.</sentence><sentence id="25">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and tried to learn shorthand and typing.</sentence><sentence id="26">I never did very well.</sentence><sentence id="27">I worked in <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, but then a letter came from a colleague in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, telling me that there were still so many children that could possibly go out -- correction, not so many, but some.</sentence><sentence id="28">And I decided, against anybody's advice, to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">And I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for about a year, and again, helped children, also worked for the German Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="30">It's interesting that even though we had very assimilated, from the very beginning, my 50 year career in social work, was almost all in Jewish social work.</sentence><sentence id="31">I prepared for my immigration, which was very difficult for many reasons, which perhaps we don't have to go into.</sentence><sentence id="32">The secret police at one time got hold of me, which was not a pleasant experience.</sentence><sentence id="33">They took my passport away, and eventually I got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because one of my English friends, a former boyfriend, wrote me a fake letter that he was going to marry me, and I would become an English citizen, and set a date for our marriage.</sentence><sentence id="34">And at that point, I got my passport back, and left in a hurry.</sentence><sentence id="35">Again, I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for a very short time.</sentence><sentence id="36">I didn't work.</sentence><sentence id="37">By that time my mother and my oldest brother had immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and so it was a bit of a family reunion.</sentence><sentence id="38">It's all not [indecipherable] clear in my memory, but somewhat like it.</sentence><sentence id="39">And my brother from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, where I als -- also had a brother, came.</sentence><sentence id="40">He was a lawyer here, working for the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of Price Administration, he must have been the levelator.</sentence><sentence id="41">Anyhow, he picked me up, and we came together to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">And it was a little funny story when I arrived here.</sentence><sentence id="43">People who thought I'd gone into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, my aunts, etcetera, had given me, of all things, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tea kettles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">So when I arrived here, and the customs opened my stuff, I was surrounded by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tea kettles</span>, and the customs official looked at me and said, "Golly, what do you want to do?</sentence><sentence id="45">Trade with the Indians?"</sentence><sentence id="46">That's the beginning of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: When did you arrive to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: In 1937, in September.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: So, just briefly maybe, we" ll turn back to your years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and could you tell me a little bit more?</sentence><sentence id="93">Was your family observant of religious holidays?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="96">A: No, we were very assimilated.</sentence><sentence id="97">Yes, proforma -- it's a harsh word, but we did observe Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</sentence><sentence id="98">Actually, I still do it, even though my life had gone up and down in between.</sentence><sentence id="99">And we were an upper class, very well known family.</sentence><sentence id="100">And what you did was always being looked at by others.</sentence><sentence id="101">But, I should mention my mother -- and I've inherited that from her, liked to help people, and she always volunteered.</sentence><sentence id="102">And she had what she called <span class="BUILDING">office</span> hours in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and she would counsel people.</sentence><sentence id="103">And as a child of seven, I was sitting under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, listening to these stories, and that's why I decided I wanted to help.</sentence><sentence id="104">And another -- and that's the last story of my past, we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I had a governess, as ever -- anybody had to, had a little money in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">And I was always afraid when the governess had the day out, and I was alone in the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">So my father, to comfort me one day, bought me a big, chocolate teddy bear, and said that, "He'll keep you company."</sentence><sentence id="107">I didn't want chocolate bear, I wanted somebody to talk to.</sentence><sentence id="108">So I cried.</sentence><sentence id="109">So my father, who was a little impatient, said, "Well, you are but spoiled.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="110">There are many poor children who have no teddy bears."</sentence><sentence id="111">I said nothing, and I thought.</sentence><sentence id="112">Day before, we had taken a walk, and my governess had said, "Let's walk slowly here," no, correction again, "let's walk fast, because this is where the poor children live."</sentence><sentence id="113">So, I thought, teddy bear, poor children.</sentence><sentence id="114">So during afternoon, I ran around, back to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> with my chocolate bear, and when I saw a little girl that looked poor to me, pressed the chocolate teddy bear into her arms.</sentence><sentence id="115">Once later, my mother was playing <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, and one of her partners said, "Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> is changing, because an absolutely strange girl walked up to my little daughter,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="119">and gave her a teddy bear."</sentence><sentence id="120">And I always say, "I have spent my life giving teddy bears to the wrong people."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: You said that your family was a total of seven children?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="122">A: Four.</sentence><sentence id="123">Four children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Oh, I thought you said that you were one of seven.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="129">One of four.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Oh, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: The youngest.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="136">Q: And briefly, would you tell me what happened to your family members, your immediate family members through the war years?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Yeah, we were very lucky, we all got out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but not together.</sentence><sentence id="139">We have never been together again as a family.</sentence><sentence id="140">My mother left a little later than I did, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, which she lived -- let's see, she left after Crystal night, and only got out because my Dutch brother-in-law came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to take her out with the help of the <span class="BUILDING">Dutch consulate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">He came, and he was politically quite on the left, and had brought quite a few fake Dutch passports, and got out two or three well known writers, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">One of them, Eric Musam, some people may be interested him, he was later killed, but he got him out.</sentence><sentence id="143">So [indecipherable].</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And did you have any encounters with anti-Semitism when you were growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Who hasn't?</sentence><sentence id="153">Yes, and I only gi -- I had all -- I -- I had, as everybody else did, I remember well my first encounter, when I was, well, maybe 12.</sentence><sentence id="154">I had a girlfriend, very blonde, and very Aryan, and her father was an architect, and we were quote, best friends, end quote.</sentence><sentence id="155">And from one day to another, she said, with tears in her eyes, "My father forbade me to play with you any</sentence></p><p><sentence id="158">longer, because you are Jewish, and he belongs to a certain German organization, and would be a danger for him if his daughter is running around with a Jewish girl."</sentence><sentence id="159">That was my very first -- and, I had to give you all these things you get from everybody, because of course, you met it everywhere, from your greengrocer -- and you met the other, too, people who stood up for you, and perhaps a most outstanding one was we had a super in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he denounced my mother to the Secret Police, and denounced me, too, because I had a non-Jewish boyfriend, which was against the Nuremberg laws.</sentence><sentence id="160">So, I mean, we had our share of this, but compared what later on happened in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, it's all chicken feed.</sentence><sentence id="161">No [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="163">I think we can perhaps move on then, to your early years in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and what you did when you first arrived.</sentence><sentence id="164">Any striking first impressions that you had, and that you'd like to recount?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Cause <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is overwhelming if you come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and my family -- I had an aunt here, who was very well-to-do, and was very nice to me, but I didn't fit into that type of society at all.</sentence><sentence id="166">I looked European, English was bad, politically I was too much interested in Social Democrats.</sentence><sentence id="167">They were very nice to me, but I didn't want to play the role of a poor relative, that's just not in me.</sentence><sentence id="168">And I had a Quaker friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, who was a teacher of music.</sentence><sentence id="169">And we had been through a lot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> together, we had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="170">So I phoned her, and said, "Etta, please get me a job, any job."</sentence><sentence id="171">And she came through.</sentence><sentence id="172">And I lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a lovely Quaker family, where my friend Etta also had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">And I did a little a-around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">I'm really not very well trained in that respect, but they were very good pe -- were actually lovely people.</sentence><sentence id="175">I took a little bit care of children.</sentence><sentence id="176">And money I didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="177">Furs I had, but no money.</sentence><sentence id="178">And the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, who was a lawyer, professor of law, discovered that I have a usable brain.</sentence><sentence id="179">And he thought to get anywhere in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I would have to study, and</sentence><sentence id="181">get at least a Bachelor.</sentence><sentence id="182">And he gave me a chance just try for a scholarship in a very good <span class="BUILDING">American college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span>, which has helped me for the rest of my life.</sentence><sentence id="183">And they again were very nice, because they believed me.</sentence><sentence id="184">I had my examination for the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which I didn't have, but I said I had lost it.</sentence><sentence id="185">And I could make up for it in an examination, I passed with very good grades, and so I got through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span> in two years.</sentence><sentence id="186">That, of course, was a big help, because then, during those two years, I used my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with borrowed money, and sublet rooms to other students.</sentence><sentence id="187">And that way, I got through <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">I just missed feeb -- Phi Beta Kappa, which I'm really angry about, because I had the cooking to do for -- and I had it easy because I majored in English, which was not in English literature, but I minored in German, so it meant I could concentrate on my major.</sentence><sentence id="189">And later on, I took psychology.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: So when you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you were also focused to some extent on social work again?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="219">A: Never left my mind.</sentence><sentence id="220">I did not tell you that before I even mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span>, I had gone to the Pennsylvania School of Social Work, who had told me I could not study social work if I wouldn't have an America Bachelor.</sentence><sentence id="221">It was very different times, and that was one reason why I was so glad to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swarthmore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">And the day I had my Bachelor, I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span>, I say, "Here I am, please let me in."</sentence><sentence id="223">They were very psychologically oriented at that time, and they seriously said to me, "Well, you know, you will have to work with people who know pain, and suffering.</sentence><sentence id="224">And to know that, you have to know it yourself.</sentence><sentence id="225">Did you ever have any suffering and pain?"</sentence><sentence id="226">And I said, "Yeah, I just left my family in Europe, I make a very precarious living here.</sentence><sentence id="227">I've met many good things, but I've also met [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Did you have much fear in you when you arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence><sentence id="229">Do you recall having that kind of emotion?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: I recall having a lot of anxiety.</sentence><sentence id="234">Not so much fear, which is very much related.</sentence><sentence id="235">I didn't think I would not get through, that never occurred to me.</sentence><sentence id="236">But I didn't know how.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: And what did you continue to hear about developments in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and Europe during this part of your schooling, and your early years in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: To be honest, I was so concentrating on daily life, that it was not very real to me.</sentence><sentence id="244">I knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">I was dead sure, if I'd ever become a citizen, I would go and try to help rebuild.</sentence><sentence id="246">I felt guilty.</sentence><sentence id="247">I was safe, and my friends were not.</sentence><sentence id="248">I was in close contact with the Quakers, who were the only organization, I believe, who could, at that time, get into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, even could -- and get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">And they, at that time, were starting their so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee section</span>, and they ask me to work in it, and to set it up.</sentence><sentence id="250">And so I knew particularly about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, that people had lost their jobs, difficulties in getting out, were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but if I'm very honest, for instance, Crystal night is not in my memory as the overwhelming experience it was, becu -- I think like, human beings, and young ones, you think about studying, about your boyfriends, about whatever the day brings.</sentence><sentence id="251">Yes, it's all going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and you also -- at least I was, a little bit cruel, and you thought, "Why didn't these people get out?"</sentence><sentence id="252">Later on, I [indecipherable] they couldn't, but I was somewhat mixed up in my thinking.</sentence><sentence id="253">It came back more and more when I -- at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee section</span>, as my daily bread, and had to write and answer letters from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, people pleading for so-called affidavits.</sentence><sentence id="254">And while I was working with Quakers, I was sent to get affidavits, and I was, of all things, going to lowa.</sentence><sentence id="255">Now, imagine this German Jewish girl, with fairly good English, but still not -- still the the English English.</sentence><sentence id="256">I was sent to farmers, who in their turn had rarely heard of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="257">So we had a great time not -- of learning each other.</sentence><sentence id="258">They showed me their <span class="DLF">farm</span>, and they showed me everything they a -- and they talk with thee and thou, as the Quakers does.</sentence><sentence id="259">And whatever they showed me, I'd never seen before.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="263">And the very nice old farmer got a little impatient, and showed me a cow, and said, "Did thee ever see a cow?"</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: So when were you in <span class="REGION">Iowa</span>, and what exactly were you trying to accomplish while you were there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: The latter I can answer first one.</sentence><sentence id="266">Probably in deg38 - "39.</sentence><sentence id="267">It's vague, but I think so, because deg39, I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, so it must have been before 39.</sentence><sentence id="268">What was your question?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: And what were you trying to accomplish while you were there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: I was charged to get affidavits of support for refugees who were still in Europe, and wanted to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">And somebody had to guarantee that they would not become a charge of welfare.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I got quite a few affidavits, because I could plead my cause.</sentence><sentence id="278">I had seen it.</sentence><sentence id="279">And I did that, really until I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, working for the Quakers, being a counselor in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">Now, this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quaker camp</span> for refugees who had already arrived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: And where was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyak</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: Can you give a little more description of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and the individuals you helped there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Sure.</sentence><sentence id="294">The people who were there, were very often couples where one <span class="NPIP">part</span> was not Jewish, or a -- some were political refugees, and not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="295">The Quakers helped everybody.</sentence><sentence id="296">The majority had Jewish blood, it was not that they were -- I don't think we had an Orthodox Jew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence></p><p><sentence id="297">But it was comparatively young people, it were majority professional people, who needed retraining in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and the director of that camp was a minister.</sentence><sentence id="298">That was a -- an interesting experience for me, and I learned a lot.</sentence><sentence id="299">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was run like all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, there's lots of language classes, and community interest.</sentence><sentence id="300">Some sport, but very little, the people had other interest at that kind than sport.</sentence><sentence id="301">Was a lot of writing to find where relatives were, and you</sentence></p><p><sentence id="304">[indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="305">There, you never forget -- forgot that there was a war.</sentence><sentence id="306">I mean, not the war [indecipherable], but there was liberation for a war.</sentence><sentence id="307">And it had the most intellectual group that I've ever met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">Oh gosh, I have another <span class="BUILDING">camptery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">Okay, a -- and I know that I wrote what I called a national hymn for that camp, which we sang for [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="310">I can't sing, I don't know music, but I wrote it.</sentence><sentence id="311">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="312">Q: Do you remember it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="314">I know where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was, Sky Island on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hudson</span>, and that was a refrain of it, everything was beautiful in Sky Island of the Hudson, [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="315">I threw all that stuff out, today it would be interesting.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: Approximately how many refugees were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: I really can't -- can only guess a hundred, wild guess.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="323">Q: And how long were you working there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="325">A: Two summers.</sentence><sentence id="326">It only existed during the summer, for people who couldn't afford a real vacation, and who needed an effer -- American atmosphere.</sentence><sentence id="327">The food was so American, they had difficulty in eating -- well, it was very well meant, very human, and was in the estate of an American psychiatrist, who still is around, Dr. Viola Bernard.</sentence><sentence id="328">She still may be [indecipherable] the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">She's not Jewish, but very, very interested.</sentence><sentence id="330">And she had a beautiful <span class="DLF">estate</span>, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">faucets</span> were sort of heads of lions, so you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="331">Okay, so much for that.</sentence><sentence id="332">And after one summer, in deg39, I started <span

id="334">But one experience that fits is, I was a -- later on -- is that true?</sentence><sentence id="335">No, doesn't happen in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, comes a little later.</sentence><sentence id="336">So I graduated, made many friends.</sentence><sentence id="337">Was interesting to me, that there, we really didn't know who was Jewish, and who was not.</sentence><sentence id="338">You know, that was such a difference.</sentence><sentence id="339">I was a rarity at that time, because refugees weren't so many at that time.</sentence><sentence id="340">And I</sentence><sentence id="342">0 know, I get along with people, and I had a great time, and eventually I graduated, in deg41.</sentence><sentence id="343">And there was no question I'd go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of social work, I got another scholarship, which meant another job on the side, but these things are typical for an immigre.</sentence><sentence id="344">And I kept my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, I rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> -- separate <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">And began to be more involved with refugee questions.</sentence><sentence id="346">I had a room mate who was very much on the left political, and didn't let me forget that it was Fascists who did all this.</sentence><sentence id="347">And we were very young.</sentence><sentence id="348">And I always get involved in strange things, so I was -- well -- political involvements, so stay out of it.</sentence><sentence id="349">And I found life very interesting, got much more Americanized.</sentence><sentence id="350">Had a very easy time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of social work.</sentence><sentence id="351">My placement was with the <span class="BUILDING">children's agency</span>, and it all seemed to me very easy.</sentence><sentence id="352">I don't know why they made so much fuss about it.</sentence><sentence id="353">The only bad thing was, I had in the morning, and in the evening, to travel for over an hour, through all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="354">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id="355">I still was in touch with the Quakers, I still have them out with the refugee faction.</sentence><sentence id="356">And I always have had a great respect and love for the Quakers, but never wanted to convert, because I always thought, you don't run away from something that's difficult into something that's easier.</sentence><sentence id="357">So the Quakers were asked by the War Education Authority -- this is now "41.</sentence><sentence id="358">Don't hold me to the dates.</sentence><sentence id="359">Not deg41, [had a -- nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="360">43, I graduated from school of social work.</sentence><sentence id="361">There is something I don't remember, and that's what -- I think right after <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I went to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span>, because I was more and more interested in psychiatric social work.</sentence><sentence id="362">And I spent one difficult year in a <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sikesville</span>, <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">And that was a -- <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of about 3,000 patients, and five physicians.</sentence><sentence id="364">And there I became very much aware of Europe and it's difficulties, because the majority of our five physicians had come from Europe, and had escaped Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="365">And there were also one Jewish physician who was American.</sentence><sentence id="366">And I told you, I get involved, sometimes I also in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">I became, in my free time, the director of the recreation for our <span

id="371">And that was not liked by the American attendants, because they had their husbands in the war, here was this one Jewish female, and she was playing around with the people who were trying to escape war duty, and messed up situation, I was in between vics.</sentence><sentence id="372">And the Jewish doctor, saw me going with my CO friends, a whole unit of them, singing Christmas

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="435">Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Gabriele D. Schiff.</sentence><sentence id="436">Mrs. Schiff, would you please tell me about your reaction to the start of World War Two, while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="439">A: What, of course, I remember first of all, was that I was suddenly an enemy alien.</sentence><sentence id="440">I'd been thrown out of my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and find myself an enemy alien.</sentence><sentence id="441">I could not have a camera, I could not have a short wave radio.</sentence><sentence id="442">And for every trip, I had to get permission from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, which means my brother, who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, working for the government, I could only go and see him with special permission, which I got.</sentence><sentence id="443">I didn't go too often, but he came to me.</sentence><sentence id="444">I -- these are individual things.</sentence><sentence id="445">My outstanding best friends at that time, were the director of the labor relations board in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>, and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="446">And they were ardent pacifists.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="447">And on the day the we -- war broke out, they asked me, "How do you feel about it?"</sentence><sentence id="448">And impulsively, I said, "I'm glad that," -- now this is when <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> got into the war, -- "that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is getting into the war, because that will give the allies more power."</sentence><sentence id="449">And they looked</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="453">2 at me in disgust, and said, "How can you be glad about any war?"</sentence><sentence id="454">And I said, "Is it better when people are slaughtered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>?</sentence><sentence id="455">Do you want that to go on for <span class="NPIP">eternity</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="456">So we had a very long discussion.</sentence><sentence id="457">We stayed friends afterwards, and we both kept our opinions.</sentence><sentence id="458">They were pacifists.</sentence><sentence id="459">I had been a pacifist for a good time of my life.</sentence><sentence id="460">As a matter of fact, when in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I was the youngest member of the [indecipherable] for Human Rights.</sentence><sentence id="461">So, that will always be my interest.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="462">But, I changed when Hitler came, and I gave up the pacifist, I just couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="463">But that's my outstanding memory.</sentence><sentence id="464">And then, of course, it was the anxiety, I couldn't get letters from Europe.</sentence><sentence id="465">I had heard so much about the first World War, because I was born in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="466">But when I was five and six, the memory was still very strong, my parents, and [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="467">So, I knew what was going to happen, and I also had a ration book during the war, but I suppose everybody had it.</sentence><sentence id="468">I don't know, I was in an <span class="BUILDING">institution</span>, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> no, in the <span class="BUILDING">state hospital</span>, and we got very little to eat, but I realized it was still much more than they had in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="469">And then, of course, I had very strong sympathies for the allies, and once in awhile, I got letters smuggled from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, or from my sister in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="470">I suffer always for some contact, somebody asked me this question.</sentence><sentence id="471">I don't remember if the letters were censored or not.</sentence><sentence id="472">I don't think I ever was out of contact with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="473">I looked -- I kept my mother's address, but not the war time, one, so I -- I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="474">I remember how I threw my camera into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, because I wasn't permitted to have it.</sentence><sentence id="475">Why I didn't give it to an American colleague, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="476">And I -- I did not have too many Jewish friends while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="477">I had roo -- <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish room</span> mates, but one was American, and as I implied, very much on the left.</sentence><sentence id="478">The other was also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and very assimilated.</sentence><sentence id="479">And so certainly we were interested, we read the papers, and we hoped that war would be over.</sentence><sentence id="480">But we also tried very hard to live from day to day.</sentence><sentence id="481">Now, this changed for me in 1943 or four.</sentence><sentence id="482">I'm really not good with figures.</sentence><sentence id="483">When the War Education asked me

class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">Because I was always insisted on living right in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, because you can't be of help if you are billeted in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="492">And these were a thousand refugees, who had been in - - yeah, it was called <span

called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Perramonte</span>, just for your information.</sentence><sentence id="494">And the refugees, the majority, by far, were Jewish.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="495">I think we had about five non-Jewish people, but we had some.</sentence><sentence id="496">We had some Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="497">And Dr. Ruth Gruber, who was the assistant to all [indecipherable] acres, who was an -- high in the government, had been sent to Europe to select from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, a thousand refugees.</sentence><sentence id="498">These had been invited by President Roosevelt, with the idea that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was starving, and he would at -- at least take a thousand mouths out.</sentence><sentence id="499">Well, it's really not a very bright idea, but it helped a thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="500">And they were invited to -- the whole time, they didn't know if they could stay in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">And what that means psychologically, you can't do it -- can't imagine.</sentence><sentence id="502">Actually, one was sent back because he was insane.</sentence><sentence id="503">The others eventually stayed here, in "45.</sentence><sentence id="504">And I've met them over the -- my career in social work, all over the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: When I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span>, I had moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> to <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span>, and that was by the middle of "45.</sentence><sentence id="954">And I did it until the end of 46, when I went, with the Joint Distribution Committee, to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="955">I had been in touch with the Joint a long time before.</sentence><sentence id="956">Actually, I'd known about it all my life, cause my family was very instrumental

representation.</sentence><sentence id="961">The Joint, and the U.S. Army, and the <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was p-part of it, were really the most constructive factors in rebuilding.</sentence><sentence id="962">I am very aware that they are under a lot of criticism, but having been on the spot, I can say that they performed a miracle.</sentence><sentence id="963">Europe at that time was chaos, people not knowing where they came from, not knowing where they were going, practically not knowing who they are.</sentence><sentence id="964">The Joint and <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> [indecipherable] really established</sentence><sentence id="966">4 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, with the help of the army, for various groups, eventually for all people.</sentence><sentence id="967">There have been so many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and they were different in the different <span

id="969">I can't remember if they had a <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>, but they had three zones.</sentence><sentence id="970">And em -- each <span class="REGION">zone</span> had it's country director, and then there was a director for all the work, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">He was in charge of it all.</sentence><sentence id="972">I know that when I came over, I was first going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, to be oriented toward what was expected to me -- of me, and to be assigned to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="973">I did not know when I left here where I would go.</sentence><sentence id="974">I assumed it would be <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> because of the language.</sentence><sentence id="975">To my great surprise it was <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="976">And my much bigger surprise came, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> always was the center where the Joint worked out of, and I spent a few weeks in a sort of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">reception camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genechita</span>, City of the Movies.</sentence><sentence id="977">It was the Hollywood of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="978">And that was a camp for every refugees that had been picked up.</sentence><sentence id="979">Every <span

thousands, it may not have been.</sentence><sentence id="983">And that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I remember as a nightmare.</sentence><sentence id="984">If you ask me who administered it, I do not know any more.</sentence><sentence id="985">I know it had no individual <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">There were partitions between the families, sort of made of sheets -- bedsheets, where you could hear every noise from the neighboring <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, which means your private life was open to the children, open to each other.</sentence><sentence id="987">It may be part because it was my first real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but I was absolutely overwhelmed.</sentence><sentence id="988">The second day I was there, there was a rumor that a Chinese had killed his wife.</sentence><sentence id="989">If that was so or not, I have no idea, but everybody talked about it.</sentence><sentence id="990">That was, in my memory, the most primitive camp, but as I say, I had just arrived, I had no basis of comparison.</sentence><sentence id="991">In a way it was good, because every other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> seemed like -- not <span class="NPIP">paradise</span>, but at least not like <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="992">And I must say, I don't remember anything of the beauty of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, which I had not seen before.</sentence><sentence id="993">I only remember this miles of humanity, badly dressed, hungry, cold -- it was winter, I came so -- in February, I think.</sentence><sentence id="994">And --</sentence><sentence id="996">5 and then I was told I was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span>, because I had experience with hospital work, and [indecipherable] work.</sentence><sentence id="997">And I got on long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride.</sentence><sentence id="998">It still was right after the war, and people always forget, your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> weren't running.</sentence><sentence id="999"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> itself had no food.</sentence><sentence id="1000">The people were under the impression still of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1001">Yes, they had won the war, oh, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> didn't here -- take it back, I'm not sure <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> won.</sentence><sentence id="1002">But they were -- everything was gray and gray.</sentence><sentence id="1003">And it took us very, very long to get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span>, which usually takes a night.</sentence><sentence id="1004">Sleeping [indecipherable] didn't work, it was -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was just a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in which a war had raged.</sentence><sentence id="1005">And one shouldn't forget, it wasn't only all Displaced Persons, it was all the Italians themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1006">You were hungry, and tired, and had no work.</sentence><sentence id="1007">When I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span>, this <span class="BUILDING">rehabilitation center</span>, being a former <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, looked like absolute luxury.</sentence><sentence id="1008">I did not stay in the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1009">I think that had had reasons, because it was tuberculosis all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1010">We had, as far as I remember, no children.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Some younger people.</sentence><sentence id="1012">I remember a young woman, perhaps in her early 20's, from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, who had survived with her parents, and they had gone through <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, and she had ch -- tuberculosis, and died, very much at the beginning of -- and I never forget it, I can still paint her face.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And that -- it's really difficult to talk about, because it's a double experience.</sentence><sentence id="1014">Here you had survivors faced with death again.</sentence><sentence id="1015">Now, what that meant to them, I can't imagine, I can only feel a little bit in my fingertips.</sentence><sentence id="1016">And still you had the same political groups fighting each other, that was the Hungarians and the Poles.</sentence><sentence id="1017">All Jewish people, but different ideas, different religious traditions.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Being angry at the world.</sentence><sentence id="1019">This is [indecipherable] people.</sentence><sentence id="1020">I remember three of young men who were not even 20 -- I mention that because you, at that age, could survive, and then in the 30's and 40's.</sentence><sentence id="1021">You hadn't many old people survive, and you hadn't many children survive.</sentence><sentence id="1022">Not in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1023">We had a doctor from <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span>, who was the M.D. director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we had Displaced Persons physicians.</sentence><sentence id="1024">We had about three physicians.</sentence><sentence id="1025">Now, either ask me how</sentence><sentence id="1027">6 many patients, I really don't know, about a hundred, could be mistaken.</sentence><sentence id="1028">Too long ago to ve -- to remember figures.</sentence><sentence id="1029">And, what perhaps has to be mentioned is that was the time where streptomycin was a rarity.</sentence><sentence id="1030">The doctors practically only had lermotorax to work with, which was a much more complicated procedure, nobody [indecipherable] it could be dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1031">Also, for the TB doctors, they had to stand very long.</sentence><sentence id="1032">This is procedure, and I know once or twice somebody fainted.</sentence><sentence id="1033">And streptomycin, we always had to get on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1034">Now, this was the center of the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1035">You exchanged streptomycin for either coffee or cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1036">And the accepted -- accepted currency were cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1037">And -- and the other thing was, there was something -- the army run co -- called the PX, which was like a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span>, with a very low prices.</sentence><sentence id="1038">And we had, as American, or an English workers, we could buy there, and we could exchange.</sentence><sentence id="1039">There are also two currencies.</sentence><sentence id="1040">There was green dollar, and oh, what was the other called?</sentence><sentence id="1041">A script.</sentence><sentence id="1042">A script, as far as I remember, you couldn't take out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I don't remember it.</sentence><sentence id="1043">The green dollar was much better, and you could get anything for a green dollar, from two dollars to [indecipherable] dollars, there was no rule or regulation.</sentence><sentence id="1044">And there was a fight to get food, because the Germans had no food themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1045">And all these things are of course, forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="1046">Now, one of these stories -- oh, I don't know how many, have been in articles I have written over the years.</sentence><sentence id="1047">They are not very new.</sentence><sentence id="1048">I've told them before.</sentence><sentence id="1049">But one can't duplicate them, I can't invent new ones.</sentence><sentence id="1050">And one which shows you the difficulty with food.</sentence><sentence id="1051">Jewish holidays, of course, played a very, very big role.</sentence><sentence id="1052">And these were the first holidays in freedom.</sentence><sentence id="1053">So, my people in the -- I call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, it's really abcenter, wanted to be like <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and have geese and chickens for Rosh Hashanah.</sentence><sentence id="1054">Now how to put loose geese and chickens, when all I had was the canned goods the Joint hand me?</sentence><sentence id="1055">Now, many, many of my people weren't even used to that.</sentence><sentence id="1056">So, the only thing to do was to ask if any of the DP's would be able to look after</sentence><sentence id="1058">7 live chicken and geese, and there was somebody.</sentence><sentence id="1059">So then I went to the mayor of this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and asked if I could have some, I would bargain against canned peas, and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="1060">Well, they let me have some.</sentence><sentence id="1061">So, in our <span class="BUILDING">DP Center</span>, we had guk, guk, guk, guk.</sentence><sentence id="1062">And they were a big excitement, we had them for a few months.</sentence><sentence id="1063">We had to feed them, they were like everybody else, starving.</sentence><sentence id="1064">And the whole group, of course, was very much interested.</sentence><sentence id="1065">And Rosh Hashanah came.</sentence><sentence id="1066">We had a cook who was German and not Jewish, so he cooked the beasts, and when he was cooking them, to get the feathers out, he used boiling water, and when he did that -- you know what a mushkia is?</sentence><sentence id="1067">The Jewish [indecipherable] overseers, which we would have foster, came in, and he looked at it and said, "Trayfa, no good, no good.</sentence><sentence id="1068">You can't eat them.</sentence><sentence id="1069">Now tell your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> what happened."</sentence><sentence id="1070">I said, "We m -- have to find a way out.</sentence><sentence id="1071">This means life to them."</sentence><sentence id="1072">Well, I had an Orthodox part, a community, they all wanted to go right to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and the un-Orthodox want to go what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1073">Now, the un-Orthodox said, "We can eat -- eat it."</sentence><sentence id="1074">The Orthodox says, "Trayfa, trayfa, it can't be done."</sentence><sentence id="1075">Then the Orthodox committee came to me and said, "You know, you have to ask a miracle rabbi."</sentence><sentence id="1076">A-Again this gentleman assimilated [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1077">Well, eventually, I found a miracle rabbi in a camp in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1078">Now, try to phone, in <span class="REGION">occupied Germany</span> after the war from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="1079">I had to call General Clay's <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, who was the commander of all of the <span class="REGION">German zones</span>, and I got some soldier who thought I was utterly nuts. "</sentence><sentence id="1080">What do you want, chicken?</sentence><sentence id="1081">Buy some chicken." "</sentence><sentence id="1082">Excuse me, I have to," -- "All right, you get clearance."</sentence><sentence id="1083">I get clearance, I call for the wonder rabbi, and I get him.</sentence><sentence id="1084">And he says, "First of all, are you a Jewish daughter?</sentence><sentence id="1085">Well, this is a very difficult question, I have to think about it.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Would you call back in two hour?"</sentence><sentence id="1087">I said, "But the things have to be cooked.</sentence><sentence id="1088">I have no time to waste, I have excited people."</sentence><sentence id="1089">Call back.</sentence><sentence id="1090">So I go through the whole thing again, get the same soldier to Clay's <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, who just -- who just shakes</sentence><sentence id="1092">8 his head, I am sure, but gives me clearance.</sentence><sentence id="1093">And then I get the answer, it's a little difficult to translate from the German Jewish. "</sentence><sentence id="1094">If the geese and the chickens were boiled in water that was higher than the boiling mark, then they are trayfa, but if that was lower, if was water right out of the faucet, then they can be eaten."</sentence><sentence id="1095">So I was on very good terms with a young <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> director, who had had a baby.</sentence><sentence id="1096">I said to him, "Please, you bathed your baby this morning in hot water from the faucet?"</sentence><sentence id="1097">He knew exactly what I was doing, said, "Yes, Miss Tarenberg, I did."</sentence><sentence id="1098">I went back, called my two committees together, and said, "That's the answer from the [indecipherable] rabbi, we can't go any higher, and we are going to eat the animals."</sentence><sentence id="1099">And we did.</sentence><sentence id="1100">But these stories, once in a lifetime.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Bad food is in all <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span>, one of the main cause for trouble, because people don't have so many things to fight about, and they let out all their hostility, their fear, their anxiety, on food.</sentence><sentence id="1102">And I have had so many debates about food, you can't imagine.</sentence><sentence id="1103">In the three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> I worked in.</sentence><sentence id="1104">So that was part of it, but the emotional atmosphere on these holidays, with the families, some were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, if they were alive, was really unforgettable.</sentence><sentence id="1105">On a more cheerful note, we had our first wedding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1106">And that again is a story, how overly sensitive people are under those conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1107">This young couple wanted to go Aliyah beth -- you know what it is?</sentence><sentence id="1108">To <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1109">And when they married -- at that time, of course, we had to create a wedding dress.</sentence><sentence id="1110">Well, the Joint had sent us lots and lots of material for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cottons</span>, and out of the cotton material, we made dr-dresses for the whole group.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And in a actual over-identification, I made myself a dress, too.</sentence><sentence id="1112">We must have looked like a <span class="DLF">flower garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1113">Anyhow, when they married, I wanted to give them a wedding present.</sentence><sentence id="1114">You don't have very much to give, and anyhow, money seemed to be the most important.</sentence><sentence id="1115">Well, I took some lira and put them in an envelope, which was from my <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, it was a little torn, and the young lady first said -- didn't say anything.</sentence><sentence id="1116">And much later came to me and said, "I didn't thank you, because I was annoyed,</sentence><sentence id="1118">9 because you didn't take care enough to put that money in a nice envelope, and write something nice on it.</sentence><sentence id="1119">We are taking that money, not for our personal gratification, but we'll give it to Aliyah beth."</sentence><sentence id="1120">I said, "You're welcome, if that gives you satisfaction.</sentence><sentence id="1121">I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="1122">I surely didn't want to hurt you."</sentence><sentence id="1123">But that's typical for the over-sensitivity.</sentence><sentence id="1124">That was a Greek girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saronica</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1125">And I found them a particularly sensitive group.</sentence><sentence id="1126">I don't know as much as [indecipherable] that I know about the other <span class="REGION">European countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1127">But they are a very sensitive group to work with.</sentence><sentence id="1128">We had quite a few.</sentence><sentence id="1129">We also had a supposedly Sephardic Jews -- Jew, from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> somewhere, who turned out not to be Jewish at all.</sentence><sentence id="1130">He was a Turk, and when a -- when he got angry, took a saber out -- I was talking -- and run around with a saber, but he ran away, end of story.</sentence><sentence id="1131">As I say, the interesting thing is that all that I remember so well, probably because I felt guilty that I couldn't do more to help them, that they all have forgotten the bad part, and of course, compared to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, this at least meant some security, but that they didn't know to which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they would go.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I remember one woman who had a utterby breakdown, with good reason.</sentence><sentence id="1133">She had waited and waited for her husband, eventually located him in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but he was married to another woman, he had thought she was dead.</sentence><sentence id="1134">And -- help.</sentence><sentence id="1135">And then, a young lady who really -- later in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, when I met her, by chance in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, became a friend of mine, had marched all the way from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, that was days and nights.</sentence><sentence id="1136">And she was young, she was almost a year -- a year -- was about 17 or 18, and almost all her family had been killed, but one brother who had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1137">And she tried violently to make an adjustment once she" ll come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1138">Had bad case of TB.</sentence><sentence id="1139">They all had TB, but this was one of the worst.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And I looked after her, I s -- sat up at night with her, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="1141">You do what you think has to be done.</sentence><sentence id="1142">It's not always social work, what's [indecipherable] happen.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And one day we got a cable from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> that her brother had died in the war against <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1144">Now I had the nice job to</sentence><sentence id="1146">0 tell.</sentence><sentence id="1147">And of course, she practically lost her mind, and so for quite a few nights I stayed with her in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and played, as well as I could, mother figure, but -- and she never got over, not even today, is happily married, but she had to tell all her past.</sentence><sentence id="1148">Many didn't talk about their past, but she felt she want to describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span>, and there were many children.</sentence><sentence id="1149">It was a very <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1150">And so every day, we set aside a certain hour for telling.</sentence><sentence id="1151">And then I left, and I didn't hear about her.</sentence><sentence id="1152">I thought of her sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="1153">I had a picture, with a very nice dedication.</sentence><sentence id="1154">And really, 40 years went by, and I -- I'm here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forest Hills</span> in a <span class="DLF">street</span>, in front of a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, looking at some hats.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And a very tiny voice behind me said, "Aren't you Miss Tarenberg?"</sentence><sentence id="1156">That was Celie, that's her name, Celia.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And she had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, had gotten TB again, was in a <span class="BUILDING">TB sanitarium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1158">Had married, happily.</sentence><sentence id="1159">Her husband died.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Had married again, living quite near here.</sentence><sentence id="1161">Has two wonderful children, and is a very good business woman, which I'd never thought.</sentence><sentence id="1162">Had [indecipherable] in business.</sentence><sentence id="1163">We see each other once in awhile.</sentence><sentence id="1164">It's gone -- I never [indecipherable] something, I cannot identify this [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1165">You find that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>, people became either very, almost fanatically religious, or said a God who lets <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> happen.</sentence><sentence id="1166">It's very difficult to say something to either.</sentence><sentence id="1167">But I found that over and over again.</sentence><sentence id="1168">And it's interesting that the stories I got at that time, went riva -- really well, just about liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, were quite different than what you get today.</sentence><sentence id="1169">I remember, I think out of my personal sy-system, I remember so well a young man who was very close to his father, they were very religious, and he had seen his father jump into the fire with a Torah in his arm.</sentence><sentence id="1170">You don't hear that any more.</sentence><sentence id="1171">But I must say, I almost cracked up on that one.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1484">Q: I think you already made some kind of reference to the kinds of discussions that you had with refugees, and whether or not they wanted to talk about their past.</sentence><sentence id="1485">Did they more often want to talk about the war time experiences in comparison to their past before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1488">A: That is difficult to say, because is a highly individual -- some people had a great need to talk about their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and to show that they had little a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, or a good business, or -- and I think people react in accordance with their personality.</sentence><sentence id="1489">You can't really make generalizations.</sentence><sentence id="1490">Some people had a great need to show how clever they had been in surviving, while today we recognize that survivor, was luck.</sentence><sentence id="1491">There are some things that have been shown, which made survivor, for instance, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, somewhat more likely, if you had a close relative somewhere who needed you.</sentence><sentence id="1492">If you had a reason to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1493">There are such things that one can perhaps a</sentence><sentence id="1495">3 little, generalize.</sentence><sentence id="1496">Some people who had a somewhat guilty conscience, had to justify the way.</sentence><sentence id="1497">There was much more things that had to be hidden at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1498">I remember one man was so upset because he had stolen potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1499">And well, there were much more serious crimes that had been done.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And yes, after the people trusted you, you would have the conflict that you could have saved somebody, but you ran, or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="1501">I always have difficulty with some of the things, because you cannot document them, you have to trust my memory, and some of these stories, I don't even mention, because I have no way of showing they really happened.</sentence><sentence id="1502">I know it, but that's my quarrel I have very often, with people I discuss this whole -- memories are memories, but they are not documentation.</sentence><sentence id="1503">They change.</sentence><sentence id="1504">Human mind is stra -- is really doing strange things.</sentence><sentence id="1505">And people who've changed their story don't even know that they have changed it.</sentence><sentence id="1506">I've had people tell me another person's story, and thought it was theirs.</sentence><sentence id="1507">So, what I always say, but that's now a personal opinion.</sentence><sentence id="1508">Your facts are the skele -- skeleton, and the stories [indecipherable] are really the flesh you put on the skeleton.</sentence><sentence id="1509">Cause it's amazing what happens.</sentence><sentence id="1510">And then there are, of course, people who do it with a purpose.</sentence><sentence id="1511">One experience is that when we were very eager to get people to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and they were -- the doctors felt they were really ready to go, but their x-rays didn't show it, we thought of [indecipherable] that the right x-rays were taken.</sentence><sentence id="1512">And the same people, when it came to restitution in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, wanted me to testify that they had tuberculosis.</sentence><sentence id="1513">That's very difficult to decide what to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="2536">The thing that stands out in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2537">my mind is that the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> were closer to their real survivor experiences, and were more</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2538">revolutionary, and also had more of a feeling of quote, that's coming to me.</sentence><sentence id="2539">And they really felt</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2542">4 that the world owed them a living.</sentence><sentence id="2543">Certainly <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, because it was so rich, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because it had handled them so badly.</sentence><sentence id="2544">As far as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, they were both located in pleasant surroundings.</sentence><sentence id="2545">I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kooven</span> ital -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> had more contact with the population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span>, than the group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> had with the inhabitants of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2546">The problems were pretty much the same, health, where to go to, how to handle one's past, and what the future will bring.</sentence><sentence id="2547">This is an oversimplification, but by now, some of the details have slipped my mind.</sentence><sentence id="2548">What is very much on my mind is the fact that many of the people who are still alive, of my <span class="BUILDING">rehab center</span> population, are in their late 50's, I think up the end of 60, and I wonder how they will handle the process of aging, which is something that affects all people, but I have a suspicion that it affects them differently.</sentence><sentence id="2549">From my work with survivors in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I have seen that they pretty much go to a second -- through a second immigration when they get older.</sentence><sentence id="2550">Certainly the language that they have handled rather well, through ha -- the middle years, gets to be slightly problematic again.</sentence><sentence id="2551">I find that older people, including me, are apt to count money in their mother tongue, which they haven't done for years.</sentence><sentence id="2552">Also, of course, living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where you haven't gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, or know anybody from the olden days, makes you doubly lonely.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2553">Loneliness, of course, comes with aging, but as a survivor, you sometimes ask yourself, what do you survive for?</sentence><sentence id="2554">I have often heard complaints by survivors that there is nobody they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, no neighbors that know the <span class="DLF">streets</span> they have walked in.</sentence><sentence id="2555">And if it comes to memories, most older people can escape into pleasant memories, and do, but what can the survivor escape to?</sentence><sentence id="2556">Slaughter, and burning, and anxiety, and death.</sentence><sentence id="2557">So, I think -- and I know that at the moment, studies being made about it, that there is actually a difference.</sentence><sentence id="2558">Yes, the experience of aging, we all have, but in a way, the survivor has it more so.</sentence><sentence id="2559">Everything gets overly intensified.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2564">Q: Have you focused on these issues of aging among the survivor population in your work, after

an -- when I still had cases -- later 1 became an administrator, I have had cases of people who were older, and my agency had a <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> once a week, for older survivors, and that always gave me a chance to talk to different people, and as I'm, in a way, one of them, they share it with me quite frankly, their pleasures, and their worries.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And, of course, sickness is another one, where people born and raised in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, may have a relative come in, or a long time friend when they need

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2625">Q: How do you look back on the emotional reaction in you, during your time working with refugees, and how -- you say you cried from this story.</sentence><sentence id="2626">What other incidents really got to your center, and bothered you, disturbed you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2629">A: The interesting thing is, the big stories don't upset you as much as the small ones, and the reason is, I cannot identify with thousand people being killed, but I can identify with a husband being proud to relieve the starving of his wife, and have it spoiled.</sentence><sentence id="2630">And I've always felt, when</sentence><sentence id="2632">7 I'm honest, it is these small things, the things that could have happened to me, in my experience, because the other things I haven't experienced.</sentence><sentence id="2633">I have not lost somebody in a fire.</sentence><sentence id="2634">I haven't lost anybody through Hitler, really, but I've lost a much -- many other things, and I know the loss were innocent.</sentence><sentence id="2635">Things I have experienced are easier to ad -- identify with.</sentence><sentence id="2636">There are some stories of escapes through snow nights.</sentence><sentence id="2637">Now, I have some there from my husband, but as you will read them, why should I tell them?</sentence><sentence id="2638">That -- his life was full of these small stories that get you.</sentence><sentence id="2639">And not only me, but everybody we knew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2653">Q: Did you feel that there was an emotional toll, or price that you had to pay to do this kind of work with refugees?</sentence><sentence id="2654">At the end of a day, did you reflect to yourself, and try to -- try to come up with ways to look at each day with perspective?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2657">A: Yes, I try to review each day, and to see if there's something I could have done better.</sentence><sentence id="2658">And when I found something, I welcome it.</sentence><sentence id="2659">An emotional toll, perhaps it didn't take, because I felt guilty to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="2660">And everything that I could do, would relieve my personal feeling of guilt.</sentence><sentence id="2661">I came out of it, I think a better social worker, or to b -- say it better, a better listener, because so much of the help one could give, was simply by listening with a sensitive ear.</sentence><sentence id="2662">You may say a trained ear, because people were so unhappy when they came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, that nobody wanted to listen to them.</sentence><sentence id="2663">And they were bitter about it.</sentence><sentence id="2664">And even today, the first thing one's being told, oh well, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, nobody wanted to hear us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2673">Q: Did you keep a journal, or in any other way record your reflections?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2675">A: I didn't keep a journal, but when something really moved me, I made either a story out of it, because I liked to write, or put it down verbatim.</sentence><sentence id="2676">I kept those notes for a long time, but I don't have them any more.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2681">Q: Again, with respect to the <span class="BUILDING">centers</span>, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> where you were working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, were there similar types of religious activities and observances, as what you saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span>, and also, what could you say about any of the cultural activities taking place in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> or centers in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2682">A: I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="2683">I don't remember that we celebrated a Jewish holiday.</sentence><sentence id="2684">I may not have been there during holidays.</sentence><sentence id="2685">I don't remember the split between Orthodox, and the assimilated that we definitely had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Merrano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2686">You may have had several [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barishkamine</span>, not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2694">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2695">I think because it was the first, and I came back from my own recuperation, and I stayed in touch with some instructors who went later to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2696">And the young girl I mentioned to you as the youngest, was later adopted by one of the doctors, and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> together, and then married a doctor, and came here, and stayed with me for some time, and I helped her find a job here.</sentence><sentence id="2697">Yes, Merrano has many more memories.</sentence><sentence id="2698">The others, I never feeled at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and it was somehow -- it was more of a job.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2734">Q: So, in other words, when you were working with refugees, you were living amongst them, or</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2735">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2736">Q: And then you would go on the weekends, or at some other point to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, is that how your routine went?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2738">A: There was never a set routine, but very often I would do that, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2740">Q: And again, just like I was asking with respect to the refugees in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> you worked with, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, did many of them wind up leaving the centers while you were there, and how did the conditions change from the point when you started, to the point when you left?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2742">A: Basically they didn't change.</sentence><sentence id="2743">Some people left, their visa came through, sometimes they found a relative unexpectedly, in Argentine or somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="2744">The big change was, there was a <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> one could go to, by -- or rather <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> one could go to.</sentence><sentence id="2745"><span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> you needed the English</sentence><sentence id="2747">0 permit, and didn't get it.</sentence><sentence id="2748">So that opened up new hope, and the spirit was a little more hopeful toward the end of my work, than in the beginning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
