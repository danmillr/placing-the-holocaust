whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="275">So we went on top of -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, on the <span class="DLF">roof</span>, and we laid down there.</sentence><sentence id="276">It was in -- in July or August, it was -- it was really so chilly, the weather was so chilly, was so cold, and we didn't have the proper clothing, but we were in the -- in top of the <span

around.</sentence><sentence id="279">Those people who were in the -- in the -- they were mostly of the Germans -- German people, not any others, so they had some food, and they shared some of us until we arrived in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and destination where we wanted to be.</sentence><sentence id="280">When we arrived in the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, I find there -- I don't remember the name of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but I know it was Suico(ph), ou-outskirt of Suico(ph).</sentence><sentence id="281">It's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsen</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">So when we arrived over there, I went to look up, I went to the Biirgermeister and I wanted to find out if there is such a such people, where they are, because they were all registered.</sentence><sentence id="283">What they did there, they -- also the American made the people to take in the refugees in -- in <span class="BUILDING">civilian homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">So, due to the fact everybody was registered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where they are,</sentence><sentence id="286">because they had to provide food for them.</sentence><sentence id="287">So he told me yes, there is -- over there and there, there is three Pasternaks.</sentence><sentence id="288">There was my oldest sister Rose, younger sister Raechel(ph), and there was another sister, Gitel.</sentence><sentence id="289">So I ask [indecipherable] they said she died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> of -- of-of typhus, something.</sentence><sentence id="290">So she died Hanukkah time, so -- and then we were all together in that time,

out from the civilian, we went in a little <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> because we were ready to be -- to go back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">It's the reason it -- because that time the allies, they made some agreement with the Russians, that the Russians gonna</sentence><sentence id="329">7 October 22, 1997 come over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suico(ph</span>) and they gonna divide something [indecipherable] I heard something or -- and -- and that means, the next day, we will be in <span class="REGION">Russian
