<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="37">Q: Let me make sure I'm getting all this on tape.</sentence><sentence id="38">I want to begin with talking about the events, maybe the weeks or days leading up to the end of the war and where you were and what you were doing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Well, the end of the -- the days of the end of the war, after I had lived through the liberation in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated on the 25th of August, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="43">And then the war ended in "45.</sentence><sentence id="44">I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and originally I had papers to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1941, but that was negated by the fact that there was Pearl Harbor and the Americans [indecipherable] entered the war.</sentence><sentence id="45">So, the papers that I had then, which was the affidavit of support, which we got from our relatives here, that expired.</sentence><sentence id="46">And of course after that, I went through all my adventures to deportation and the escape and the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and everything.</sentence><sentence id="47">But in "45, at the end of the war, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and was awaiting the documents that my aunt, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> sent me, which is an affidavit of support, at the end of 1946, I received my visa of entry into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">And in January of 1947, the 19th of January 1947, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LeHavre</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and took the John Erikkson to the <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span>, a 10 days crossing.</sentence><sentence id="49">And I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on the 29th of January, 1947, which is now a little over 51 years.</sentence><sentence id="50">To some people, a lifetime, to me it flew by just like this and it's hardly to be believed, that's 51 years have gone by, yes.</sentence><sentence id="51">So I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> at the end of the -- of -- of the war and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="52">At that point, I didn't know yet what had happened to my family, although the -- the indications were quite ominous</sentence><sentence id="54">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 4 that a tragedy had happened, because we knew already what had happened on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I knew that my mother -- hadn't heard since "42.</sentence><sentence id="55">So that was, to me, an indication.</sentence><sentence id="56">So I came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I -- I was then s-still ignorant of the fact what happened to my mother and sisters.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: I'd like to ask you about that in -- in a little bit, but do you recall -- I think I re-recall reading something about liberation day and you were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where they were -- German soldiers were being led through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: Yeah, that's in the book, also.</sentence><sentence id="77">That is in my book, the book will come out at the end of this year -- towards the end of the year now.</sentence><sentence id="78">Probably November of 1998 and the book will be called, "Leap into Darkness - Seven Years on the Run in <span class="REGION">Wartime Europe</span>".</sentence><sentence id="79">It's co-written by my good friend Michael Oleska, the -- actually, he was the -- he motivated me to write it and then he was editing it f-for me and we did mutual project, was -- it went very well.</sentence><sentence id="80">Taught me a lot and gave me an opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="81">But, at the end of the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span>, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">That's where I was when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was liberated.</sentence><sentence id="83">And the garrison, the German oc -- the German garrison in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> was not the same as it had been before June of 1944, because some of them were sent to the <span class="REGION">war front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">The landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> took place on the sixth of June.</sentence><sentence id="85">And on the 10th of June was the burning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orodure</span>, to which I was a -- almost witness, because I was on my way there and got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when I saw a German transport going there and I didn't want to go into the same direction.</sentence><sentence id="86">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and all it's inhabitants, except a few, burned with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">And I was just about maybe 10 - 15 miles away</sentence><sentence id="89"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0016 5 from them.</sentence><sentence id="90">Everyone that had a ticket for Orodure, to get off, which I had -- was taken into <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, was part of that massacre.</sentence><sentence id="91">So there again, I was lucky in a great, great way.</sentence><sentence id="92">You see, my escape is not so much survival and -- and that's why I say I don't exult in it.</sentence><sentence id="93">It's a -- it's a question of -- of fear and luck.</sentence><sentence id="94">The fear is the motivater and then you got to be lucky for -- for it to succeed or to -- to get away.</sentence><sentence id="95">So, that was just -- before the liberation, after the liberation, we had these -- the remnant of the German garrison in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">They were taken down the main <span class="DLF">street</span>, down towards the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> by a ragtag outfit of the resistance, whom the Germans considered dispensable, just a few weeks earlier.</sentence><sentence id="97">And here, this ragtag outfit that didn't have matching shoes, had the nerve.</sentence><sentence id="98">Anything to -- to -- to -- to hold on to basically, except their pride and their joy that the -- now, the war -- the end of the war came.</sentence><sentence id="99">Those Germans acted like little sheep, you know.</sentence><sentence id="100">Their -- a few weeks earlier they were the masters and at that moment they walked with their hands on top of their heads and looking scared.</sentence><sentence id="101">Why?</sentence><sentence id="102">Because they're human beings.</sentence><sentence id="103">And some of them were young.</sentence><sentence id="104">I mean they were in the hands of these underground people and they knew that these undergrounds had a bone to pick with them.</sentence><sentence id="105">They knew that wh-wh-wh-when we are in their hands, we are not in the hands of - - of a -- of -- of an enemy's ha -- high command, where they have to deal with -- with protocol and war amenities.</sentence><sentence id="106">The amenities of exchanging and of fairness, imprisonment.</sentence><sentence id="107">These -- these underground, th-the -- the resistance, they were bent on -- on vengeance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: And you are -- were a member of this ragtag [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="147"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0016 6</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: I -- I was -- I was not -- I -- | was a member of the -- of the Sixth.</sentence><sentence id="149">The -- the Sixth was a group that was engaged in clandestine performances, like doing false identification cards and -- and documents.</sentence><sentence id="150">We did that already, before the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="151">But, we were all under a -- taking orders.</sentence><sentence id="152">Some were connected with the FTPF, they were called.</sentence><sentence id="153">In French it's Front Tereur Partisain Francais.</sentence><sentence id="154">Front tereur means snipers or guerrillas.</sentence><sentence id="155">Partisain -- partisans, you know.</sentence><sentence id="156">They were a tough -- oh, how do you say it?</sentence><sentence id="157">Rough, rock and tumble outfit.</sentence><sentence id="158">They didn't go by -- by orders or by command.</sentence><sentence id="159">There was another group was called FFI, the Force Francais L'Interiore.</sentence><sentence id="160">The French Forces of the Interior.</sentence><sentence id="161">They took orders from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DeGaulle</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">And there was this conflict between the two groups.</sentence><sentence id="163">The one wanted to go the -- the legal -- the -- the proper way.</sentence><sentence id="164">The other said, "We're going to get the enemy whichever way we can."</sentence><sentence id="165">So this -- this was the group.</sentence><sentence id="166">And under -- we were usually under these orders.</sentence><sentence id="167">But the partisans that arrested the Germans, they were the ones that had come out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> carrying their rifles.</sentence><sentence id="168">Some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rifles</span> -- most of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rifles</span> were not loaded.</sentence><sentence id="169">But the rifle looked good and inspired -- if -- if -- if not fear, at least respect.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Do you remember what you were feeling that particular day, after -- after so many years on the run and so much uncertainty?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: Well, it -- it -- it -- it was -- there was elation.</sentence><sentence id="195">There was jubil -- jubilant attitudes, you know.</sentence><sentence id="196">In the <span class="DLF">streets</span> it was festive, carnival-type.</sentence><sentence id="197">And people were rejoicing that -- that -- to see that the Germans had been defeated because the atrocities -- in fact, I write that in the book, down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, th-they were -- they were carrying placards, "Remember</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="201">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0016 7 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orodure</span>", that's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that they burned down, you know.</sentence><sentence id="202"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Euphoria</span>, that's the word.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="203">Wh --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="205">You -- you were feeling euphoric, yourself?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="207">The mood was euphoric.</sentence><sentence id="208">And then with it came a sobering moment, mixed in with that euphoria.</sentence><sentence id="209">That while the war is finished, there are families somewhere from whom we hadn't heard.</sentence><sentence id="210">So, to us this was the beginning of a new chapter of finding out and searching.</sentence><sentence id="211">And being here dealing with things.</sentence><sentence id="212">When <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was liberated, in "44 - - in August "44, we knew that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was not defeated yet.</sentence><sentence id="213">In fact, that same year, in the -- in the fall, came the Battle of the Bulge.</sentence><sentence id="214">And in that counter attack by the Germans, they advanced far enough for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to feel that there might be another -- a re-occupation.</sentence><sentence id="215">That never happened.</sentence><sentence id="216">The allies -- allies prevailed.</sentence><sentence id="217">But that was that moment.</sentence><sentence id="218">Germans were still kicking -- alive and kicking.</sentence><sentence id="219">And when the landing took place in "44, during that period, in June of "44, the deportations from <span class="REGION">southern France</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.925833" long="2.445278">Drancy</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> were still going on.</sentence><sentence id="220">So even that euphoric moo-mood, about the landings, had to be tempered with -- with the knowledge that people are still being sent away.</sentence><sentence id="221">But then when -- when -- in 1945, in May of "45, the armistice was signed, there was a different attitude.</sentence><sentence id="222">Now, we knew that the war was ended and we had to deal with the aftermath.</sentence><sentence id="223">For many of us, that had to do with family, because we had left our families and loved ones and some of it -- some of them left with their families, but in the process of fleeing, of going to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and living on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vichy</span>, some of those fa-families had been separated.</sentence><sentence id="224">Young men were hiding out while their parents were</sentence><sentence id="226"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0016 8 deported.</sentence><sentence id="227">That happened quite often, you saw that in the movies with -- with "Au revoir mes enfants" and you had so many other things and -- and so in Freedman in the wrote -- the wro -- who wrote that book, "When Memory Comes", he was taken to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and his parents were deported and never came back.</sentence><sentence id="228">And finally he got back to his Judaism, because he -- he was converted by the padres and -- no, bu -- bu -- no, he went to a -- not to a con -- he went to a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span>, I think.</sentence><sentence id="229">So anyway, we all had to deal with these things and knowing that the war was over was very good, but there was the family's story and the history of -- and the aspect of -- of dealing with it -- dealing with it from emotional standpoint because we -- we -- it was the great uncertainty, who had survived and who had not survived.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: And how did you go about beginning to deal with it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: I tried to start searches.</sentence><sentence id="259">Red Cross and other <span class="BUILDING">venues</span> and did actually not find out until 1962 what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="260">That was from "47 to "62, 15 years -- what happened to my mother and sisters, which is also in -- in the book.</sentence><sentence id="261">And how I dealt at the moment?</sentence><sentence id="262">At that moment I was -- in 1946, I was 25 years old, I had survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="263">I had received my papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">And frankly I was looking forward to getting away from the continent there.</sentence><sentence id="265">It had not been too kind to me, to say the least and of course, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266"><span class="COUNTRY">Countries</span> are always beautiful, it's what the people do that's not so good, often, you know.</sentence><sentence id="267">But <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to me was -- was a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that I wanted already to get away from because I had been in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I had been deported and I had been beaten up and so on.</sentence><sentence id="268">I -- I looked forward to coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, wh-where I knew I had family</sentence><sentence id="270"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0016 9 and start a new life.</sentence><sentence id="271">And that's what I was dealing with.</sentence><sentence id="272">I did not dwell too much on the fact that I better stay in Europe and try to find my mother and sisters, because I had reached out to Red Cross and other agencies and I never heard anything.</sentence><sentence id="273">And of course at that time, the communication system had not developed to the point where you knew who had survived, who had not survived.</sentence><sentence id="274">So I -- I wanted to be just getting away from there and I knew that staying there wouldn't advance anything from me emotionally, because I'd only be still under the -- the impact of what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="275">And I looked forward to make a break.</sentence><sentence id="276">And that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="277">I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">I did not dwell too much on the sentimentality. [</sentence><sentence id="279">indecipherable] stay here and -- and -- and -- and - - and f -- and fight it to the end, because the continent was no longer for me, you see?</sentence><sentence id="280">I wanted to get away from it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: How did you support yourself?</sentence><sentence id="307">You were a young man and for those two years before you came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: Well, we were all -- the American Joint Distribution Committee, they were in charge, even during the war, with some of the aid that they distributed to us.</sentence><sentence id="311">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> I worked for a aid committee, the Corshazod committee -- com-com-Committee d" Assistance Sociale est Secouron a Reconstructione.</sentence><sentence id="312">A -- a reconstruction of every -- we helped people who came back, who were repatriated or people who came out of hiding.</sentence><sentence id="313">And to -- to establish themselves with -- with ID cards and rejoining families.</sentence><sentence id="314">I worked for that committee and -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limoge</span> and that committee was also in charge of distributing the Joint Distribution -- the American Joint Distri -- A -- the -- AJDC -- the JDC,</sentence><sentence id="316"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0016 10 American Joint Distribution Committee -- Committee.</sentence><sentence id="317">They sent funds into Europe and they were the arm that extended into the -- into the Jewish community of friends and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in the -- in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Can you tell me about your --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: And by the way, on that committee, I got paid for working there.</sentence><sentence id="330">Nominally, but I didn't need to go to fancy <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span>, you know or something like that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Tell me about your -- your trip to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1947.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: I was ina -- on the Jo -- SS John Erikkson.</sentence><sentence id="334">I was -- I think about a 37 -- 37,000 ton former <span

id="345">Arrangements of popular tunes, especially American tunes.</sentence><sentence id="346">And there was a young lady, who was a war bride and she came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to
