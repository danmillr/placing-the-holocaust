<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: What exactly did you learn from talking to those people who were there?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="56">A: It's unfortunate that the media here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> didn't write too much about it, a-and if they did, like the "New York Times" they wrote it on a-- not ona main page, but wrote it on pages afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="57">It's -- the only time when they wrote the things on the first page was during Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="58">And afterwards they didn't write it on front of the pages.</sentence><sentence id="59">I read the paper, of course, and while I read the paper, I also learned English more, and -- and I can only say this, you see, that when the war started I was registered in class 4-D, which was clergy going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because I went to the Yeshiva and they were exempt from actually joining the war, even though I tried to join the war and -- but the only thing was at that time, either buy war bonds, or I even tried to join the war by being an air raid warden, but after awhile they told me, you cannot be an air raid warden, I was considered an enemy</sentence><sentence id="61">alien, despite the fact that I was Jewish in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I always had to get permission even to travel, let's say from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span>, where I had a little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="68">Q: What was reaction of the Jewish community around you to the news that was coming out of Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="70">A: The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">A-After the war?</sentence><sentence id="72">After the war, about 1945, 1940 si -- 1946, I left the Yeshiva in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>, the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva Rabbinical college</span>, I left them.</sentence><sentence id="73">I got semicha there and I talked about this, they tried to help Jews in Europe, they send out packages to them, they send out packages and then I tried to find people from my birthplace to whom I could talk and who maybe knew more about what happened at my particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was born.</sentence><sentence id="74">And I found people, I found people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">There was some people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> by the name of Greenburg(ph).</sentence><sentence id="76">I talked to them what had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">| also talked about other people, I went to organizations, like -- had a big demonstration in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">They had the em -- demonstrations all over, and bringing people e -- over, and many people came over afterwards, but they had not actually been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nazi concentration camps</span> per se, they had, during the war they had gone from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so forth to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> or into other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">And they came over.</sentence><sentence id="80">And then [indecipherable] and other people came over.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: [have a couple questions about what you just said.</sentence><sentence id="86">You said you left the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span>, you got semicha there.</sentence><sentence id="87">Can you explain what that means?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Semicha means like ordination to be a rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="89">At that time, the rabbi at the <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> was Rabbi Ruderman, who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> just before the war.</sentence><sentence id="90">In fact, his wife was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenigsberg</span>, was <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span>, part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">And it -- and it was not -- there were not too many people -- during the war, of course, the number of students at the yeshiva increased and after the war it went down.</sentence><sentence id="92">At the end of the war, especially, I tried to become a United States citizen.</sentence><sentence id="93">Already during the war I tried to become a United States citizen.</sentence><sentence id="94">In 1943 was the first time I made an appeal to become an American citizen.</sentence><sentence id="95">Now at that time, the immigration policy was that you had to have first papers, and after first papers you have to wait five years and you can make an application to become a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="96">So, when I made my first application 1943, I was asked to come before a board in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>, five different organizations, the navy, the -- the war , the defense and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="97">And it was -- it was rejected because at that time the war was -- looked very bad because the Nazis had been stopped at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and it was very bad, so they didn't want anyone to become a citizen unless they actually went to war.</sentence><sentence id="98">And later on I made the application, think around 1950, though it might be earlier, with the FBI to go for translations.</sentence><sentence id="99">So they said, if you want to make translation, we have to send you to</sentence><sentence id="101"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, | didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, so I stayed here.</sentence><sentence id="102">But they helped me also in -- to get my second papers, and I got them in, as I said before, in 1951.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: And that's when you became a citizen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Then I became a United States citizen, and as I mentioned before, I changed my name at that time.</sentence><sentence id="122">And I was already married then, because we married in 19 -- got married in 1948.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Is your wife also a survivor of the Holocaust?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Yes, my wife was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and she moved to Firth(ph).</sentence><sentence id="128">And they were living there and the -- her father was a merchant, he had -- they had a business, and -- and of course like all people at that time, tried to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the Kristallnacht, which I consider the beginning of the end.</sentence><sentence id="129">Everyone knew that it would not change any more and they had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="130">Before that time, we also had tried to come out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but I don't want to talk before that time, but only say that they finally, in 1939, that's before the war, she came out with the Kindertransport, children's transport to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">And their parents also came out, because they had some relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">I had also tried to come out with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, but just on the date when I received the permission to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, they stopped it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: I wanted to go back to something you said a few moments ago, about being at <span class="BUILDING">magison</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: -- with [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="151">Can you tell me about that event?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="154">A: It was a big crowd in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">They made many [indecipherable] meetings.</sentence><sentence id="156">But, as I understand it now, you see, and as J read in the newspaper and so forth, there were always requests of people to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">They -- at -- at that time, in order to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, [indecipherable] you needed a -- what's called a certificate -- zertifickat.</sentence><sentence id="158">And there were only a certain number of zertifikats available per year for people from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, because a number of zertifikats had been set in nine [indecipherable] that time, and at that time the -- the -- the -- the -- I mean, the type of population in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was different than it was in 1940 and 1950.</sentence><sentence id="159">So, many people got certificates but they were only dated for two or three years later.</sentence><sentence id="160">And who wanted to wait two or three years?</sentence><sentence id="161">We didn't want to wait two or three years.</sentence><sentence id="162">We didn't have an American certificate, even though I know from my records, and my mother, that she had -- my father had applied to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> already in the 20's, but my mother didn't want to go because she had all her family in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">So that's why we stayed there.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: I'd like you as an eyewitness, to tell me what was going on in that protest at madis -- <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">If you could describe the scene and what was said, and -- and the feelings that the people had.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: I don't know any more exactly what went on there.</sentence><sentence id="171">I can only tell you it was a very big meeting.</sentence><sentence id="172">You see, the <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> has a very big <span class="NPIP">place</span> and it was filled up to capacity.</sentence><sentence id="173">And there were many people who spoke about it, what happened in -- in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and what could be done and they wanted to -- they wanted to influence the American government to do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="174">In that respect, I mean a little bit to the side, when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span>, there was a young man, he was young at that time, who came every week, every Thursday to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span> and from there he went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to discuss with cabinet ministers to let Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="175">And his name was Michael Trist(ph), and the person he talked to that was discussing, Moshe Sherer, which recently passed away, became the president of the Agudath(ph) [indecipherable] organization.</sentence><sentence id="176">But every week they came out.</sentence><sentence id="177">And some of the <span class="BUILDING">yeshivas</span> and some of other organizations made it, but it was a very tough time because the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was interested -- and it is not against the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was interested to win the war.</sentence><sentence id="178">If we win the war, then everything will change.</sentence><sentence id="179">So we cannot bomb the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And they heard the person, Jacob Rosenheim, | have his</sentence><sentence id="182">book here, and I heard him speak many times, who le -- sent letters, and I have the copies of the letters which he sent to Roosevelt and other people to do this.</sentence><sentence id="183">Only one person was successful to a certain extent, a limited extent and it was Ruth Gruber, I don't know if you heard of her, who arranged with Secretary Ickes and Morgenstern(ph) and so forth, they arranged that thousand -- that they permit a thousand Jews to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span>, one of my family, and we also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">In -- that's in the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswego</span> is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Erie</span>, | think, it's in the state of New York.</sentence><sentence id="185">So they did very many things, so the people came over and they were protesting and they were writing and they were talking to in-influential people.</sentence><sentence id="186">But it was not the mood at that time.</sentence><sentence id="187">It was just -- in fact, they never felt that anything bad happened to the Jews, and it could be changed, until Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="188">I think by Kristallnacht it changed, because that was the first time that Roosevelt called his ambassador from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> away and talked to him about what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: When the war was over, and you said you had read articles, not on the front page, about what had happened to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="210">I would like to get a sense from you of what the Jewish community in the -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, religious or secular, whatever you can share with me, what was the reaction of the Jewish community and -- and was there much said by the Jewish community?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="217">Q: Many think that, and it was not always positive, unfortunately, because when I came and the whole family came in, already before the war, in 1939 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> we came, before we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, there were in -- in the community there were mone -- mostly older people and they could not believe it that it was as bad as it really was, even if we told it to them, you see, they could not believe it.</sentence><sentence id="218">And we were considered even when we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, refugees, an-and it -- an-and considered refugees.</sentence><sentence id="219">We were called greenhorns.</sentence><sentence id="220">It's completely different now, when the Russian Jews came over, and they were accepted as [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="221">We were -- we be -- came there with only four dollars from -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which we could take out, four dollars.</sentence><sentence id="222">This was 10 marks at that time, 10 marks was four dollars.</sentence><sentence id="223">And even when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">yeshiva</span> I had to canvas that -- that we put clothing, other things like this, doctors, or medical servicing and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="224">We were not considered actually as it was, as bad as it really was.</sentence><sentence id="225">They did not think it was as bad as it really was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: How long did it take for -- for you or the people around you to grasp the full extent of the genocide, just how many people were killed?</sentence><sentence id="236">How long did it take for that information to come across?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: You must know that everything which was done by the Nazis was done secretly.</sentence><sentence id="244">And that's why people still denied if afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="245">And that's also why many people didn't know about it until very much -- because, as I mentioned before, in the beginning we did -- we did receive some correspondence, but afterwards we didn't receive correspondence.</sentence><sentence id="246">Everything went -- I don't know how it came over here [indecipherable] channels, small radios, because they had no television here.</sentence><sentence id="247">It came out slowly after the war, it came out, even so set -- so far that last year when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, | heard certain things which I didn't even know happened during the war.</sentence><sentence id="248">You see, even now, 50 years later, 60 years later you see, there are certain things which had never been publicized and which only come out now.</sentence><sentence id="249">It's unfortunate, you see, when so much in secrecy that people couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="250">It was unbelievable, it's beyond belief what happened there, that a -- such a thing in a --a highly civilized, scientific <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> should happen like this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: How closely did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: At that time there was already television, I think, 1946 and we tried to see -- look at the -- look at the television, find out what ha -- what was going to happen and we saw other people there.</sentence><sentence id="262">But in my impression, I mean the impression of most people was [indecipherable] that these people were so brainwashed, or crazy, or whatever you call this, you see, saying that I had nothing to do with it because I followed</sentence><sentence id="264">orders.</sentence><sentence id="265">Same thing was when they killed my mother also, they said, we followed orders.</sentence><sentence id="266">But they did not have their own mind, they just said they followed orders.</sentence><sentence id="267">Of course, the world knew by that time that they could have done something because they had power and they had all the authority to do what they wanted to do and they didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="268">And not only this, the worst thing of it, that they in- intimidated the whole population to do this -- to go in the same way.</sentence><sentence id="269">That no one actually acted freely on his own free will.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Did you follow the U.N. vote on the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: Yes, we followed it very closely.</sentence><sentence id="282">It was in November and we followed the vote and it took some time to find that the majority vote came out about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">That was going on for a long time, because it actually started long before the war.</sentence><sentence id="284">In 1936 with the British, you see, were not too happy and were not too much in favor of -- of it at all.</sentence><sentence id="285">And they even -- many people died because they tried to go there by force to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="286">They couldn't land, they got sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="287">But before the -- this, we saw them, that finally came through.</sentence><sentence id="288">We were very much ap -- surprised, especially that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> voted for it.</sentence><sentence id="289">But of course no Arabs, they voted for it and they never acknowledged it.</sentence><sentence id="290">And to this date, no one blames them for anything, but they really do because they never voted for it.</sentence><sentence id="291">For them it doesn't exist.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Let's take a break and see if we can get -- stop that background noise.</sentence><sentence id="296">All right, we're back now and I had been asking you about the partition of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and I wanted to get a sense of you -- from you, of what was going on here in the Jewish community with respect to the partition and the birth of the state of Israel.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: The entire Jewish community here, as far as I know and I saw, was very much interested in what was going to happen, because many Jews had already gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and they did not feel safe in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and they did not know what would happen, the 21 Arab states would be poised to -- to break <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and not to have peace with them, you see, even though the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and I know that, offered any person, whatever nationality, whatever sex, whatever religion, to stay there and they would live in peace.</sentence><sentence id="298">But there was so much hatred and unfortunately we still have hatred in the world, that they said no, don't stay there, go out, because they will kill you.</sentence><sentence id="299">They did not have in mind to kill you, just now [indecipherable] in mind to kill anyone.</sentence><sentence id="300">Not as, number one, not [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="301">And they went out and they made the concen -- they made these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camps</span>, in which they are existing today, and the U.N. supported it.</sentence><sentence id="302">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">U.N.</span> when the <span class="BUILDING">U.N.</span> was, at that time meeting.</sentence><sentence id="303">They were meeting already before 1945, the U.N. went in, and what would happen there, they saw people standing -- people standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and there was -- this is -- was -- o-other people in</sentence><sentence id="305">Interview with Jacob Wiener 6 October 25, 1998 there, beca -- all the people wanted peace.</sentence><sentence id="306">All the -- they want to live in peace with other people too, but they just couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="307">As I mentioned many times, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I mentioned it too, the most pious person cannot live in peace if the wicked neighbor doesn't want it.</sentence><sentence id="308">That's one German citation, that the Germans made themselves.</sentence><sentence id="309">Schiller(ph) made it.</sentence><sentence id="310">His poem.</sentence><sentence id="311">So we were very much afraid that we would not have peace, but we all very much wanted peace.</sentence></p></dialogue>

things were changed.</sentence><sentence id="335">And who knows what it is starting in a new life and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="336">I wanted to go there, we learned already Hebrew at that

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: First I want to say that the Jewish people were always against war.</sentence><sentence id="343">We want to try to settle everything by peace as much as possible, even if it's [indecipherable] unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="344">But I remember one instance, I think it was the -- the war -- the Six Day War in 1967, I think.</sentence><sentence id="345">And at that time I was -- I had a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I went to a convention in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence

October 25, 1998 what can we do in order to make peace here?</sentence><sentence id="355">Well, there were all different answers and one person, this Lady James gave a very interesting answer, she said, we should build a <span class="DLF">wall</span>, like they have the <span class="DLF">China wall</span> -- <span class="DLF">Chinese wall</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and the other things.</sentence><sentence id="356">They had another <span class="DLF">wall</span> [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">Berlin wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="357">So we make a -- at that time they were all interested in making peace by <span class="DLF">building walls</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">So they had the intention, this lady says, you make a <span class="DLF">wall</span> between the Israelis and the Arabs.</sentence><sentence id="359">Of course it never happened, but that was the psychology and the -- the ideas of the people at that time, you see that they might think -- that they think by making <span class="DLF">walls</span>, you can make peace.</sentence><sentence id="360">Just like during the war, you see, when the French made the <span class="DLF">Maginot line</span>, they thought with a <span class="DLF">wall</span> they can [indecipherable] the peace and the Nazis just walk around.</sentence><sentence id="361">And that was an interesting idea she had.</sentence><sentence id="362">Then of course there were the other wars [indecipherable] but when the -- the Six Day War, you know, when they suddenly saw that the Jews were winning and there was a euphoria and they went in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed sheets</span> and you collected money, everything was okay, but unfortunately, this a mistake for the Jewish people, they did not see what they could have done at that time, if they had done it at that time, we wouldn't have trouble now.</sentence><sentence id="363">For instance, at that time the whole west thing, everything was okay.</sentence><sentence id="364">At that time they started to call it the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West

were going on between <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, there was always a trouble -- they were always afraid the Jews would win.</sentence><sentence id="370">And they did win in some [indecipherable] at that time when the [indecipherable] and they captured all of the <span class="REGION">Sinai peninsula</span> and they even had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arafat</span> surrounded.</sentence><sentence id="371">They did not do anything with him, they let them all go [indecipherable] I don't know if the others would have done this if they had cir-circled -- encircled the Jewish people and so forth, they would not let one person le -- go out alive.</sentence><sentence id="372">But that's what the Jewish mentality is.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: It was the <span class="DLF">Suez canal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">And I want to say only one thing, it could have been peace, and this was -- and I remember this, you know, Golda Meier, who was the prime minister at that time, she made peace with Sadat.</sentence><sentence id="411">Cause even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sadat</span> had fought the Jews, but they made peace on the basis, and that's why she [indecipherable] she said we both have grandchildren and we don't want our grandchildren to live through war.</sentence><sentence id="412">You see, so -- so therefore there is some point where you can bring people together.</sentence><sentence id="413">But you can only bring them together -- they</sentence><sentence id="415">Interview with Jacob Wiener *deg October 25, 1998 mentioned <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> too, if you learn from the past.</sentence><sentence id="416">We have [indecipherable] grandchildren who -- in the future, so have to learn from that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="426">Q: How closely did you follow the Eichmann trial?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: At that time again, we followed it by radio and by television and we were very much surprised that they found him, because he did not identify himself.</sentence><sentence id="429">Only afterwards they found out about it.</sentence><sentence id="430">And then it was ORT and television and a-all, and we heard all the reports which were done.</sentence><sentence id="431">It's unfortunate again that one person [indecipherable] he should not have been executed, but -- well, I don't know, you see, because he executed thousands and hundred thousands of people, he is one person.</sentence><sentence id="432">He was guilty, that's all [indecipherable] but again, to the last minute, he denied that he was responsible.</sentence><sentence id="433">He denied his responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="434">People don't want to be responsible.</sentence><sentence id="435">I did by -- by orders.</sentence><sentence id="436">But that was his order, because he was one of the three or four people at the Wannsee conference who made the decision of the final solution.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="446">Q: Did you feel justice was done?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="448">A: I think there was done justice, you see.</sentence><sentence id="449">Even though we say -- even though the Jewish religion they say God is the final judge, you know, God is the final judge, but -- and justice will come eventually and it did come eventually because the war ended and Hitler did not achieve what he wanted to achieve, so he was the final</sentence><sentence id="451">judge, but at that moment it was in the hands of the <span class="BUILDING">human court</span>, with the majority of mankind at that time, because everyone was involved.</sentence><sentence id="452">So therefore, I think there was justice done, to that extent.</sentence></p></dialogue>

before.</sentence><sentence id="960">It's unfortunate that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryland</span> it's not compulsory to teach the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="961">But I know they

already told the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> there are certain things which I don't feel are correct.</sentence><sentence id="975">For instance, certain people, you see, certain people who had the experience and so forth, should be used to do some research in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> and -- and I found that -- that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> is more interested in certain facts, not -- they would hear more about the emotions from other people, you see [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="976">Of course, when you have emotions, you may not always be neutral, but there is no person in this world who is a neutral, you cannot be neutral in th -- in -- in th -- in your mind [indecipherable] where it says you can be neutral in facts, you see.</sentence><sentence id="977">So for instance,</sentence><sentence id="979">40 Interview with Jacob Wiener October 25, 1998 I [indecipherable] to them that they are -- they're preparing people who have studied from books and every book has a certain bias.</sentence><sentence id="980">Because you can have 10 books and you have 10 certain points of view in 10 certain books.</sentence><sentence id="981">You cannot be full of bias.</sentence><sentence id="982">Of course, the survivor, or someone [indecipherable] also has certain biases, because what he went through.</sentence><sentence id="983">But his personal bias is -- is actually what he learned during the Holocaust, I mean what the experience in the Holocaust, what I experienced or others experienced during the Holocaust, so [indecipherable] so therefore I say, if you'd send someone out to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> for instant, you know, many survivors don't like to do this, because they want -- don't want to have a second experience.</sentence><sentence id="984">But the people who go there with a professional degree and book knowledge, they may not know which questions to ask, proper questions.</sentence><sentence id="985">And that's why I said to them many times that -- that I feel you should at least send one person also from the -- from those Holocaust people, you see, the sur -- survivors and they should bring out their -- their emotions, wha -- how they feel about it.</sentence><sentence id="986">I feel about certain <span class="NPIP">things</span>, you see, feeling is not [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="987">And that's one thing.</sentence><sentence id="988">And then -- then, like I, you see, I don't feel too comfortable in maybe saying everything which is there, but you cannot always -- you don't know who the other person is, how the other person would take it, if I tell them from my own inner heart, you see, how I feel about it.</sentence><sentence id="989">So I don't honestly know that, you see,</sentence><sentence id="991">Interview with Jacob Wiener * October 25, 1998 but I don't want to insult the person on -- and things like this.</sentence><sentence id="992">But -- but let's say when I lead the groups around, you see, I tell them how I feel about it.</sentence><sentence id="993">And I tell the other people who I -- how I feel about it.</sentence><sentence id="994">And I don't always know if this is the right way to say or not.</sentence><sentence id="995">You should always say your -- your feelings.</sentence><sentence id="996">If you have very strong feelings about it, like I had about -- as I mentioned to you before, about people can come out and they say they don't believe in God any more, you see, now I have the strong feelings about this.</sentence><sentence id="997">But -- and na -- once happened when I -- when someone has invited me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, psychologist, a friend of mine, he asked me to talk about what happened during Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="998">I couldn't say it, because it -- I was -- it was too much for me, I couldn't say it.</sentence><sentence id="999">I do cry.</sentence><sentence id="1000">I couldn't say it.</sentence><sentence id="1001">So there are certain times, in

Holocaust, what happened to me, but after awhile I said to myself, the world must know, you see, like the book says.</sentence><sentence id="1004">And, so therefore I said I would [indecipherable]
