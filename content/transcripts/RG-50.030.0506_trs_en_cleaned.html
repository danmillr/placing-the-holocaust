<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: It was, I believe, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">And from what I remember it was quite a -- a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from the perspective of a very young child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Now I know that your -- your dad left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when?</sentence><sentence id="86">Was it after the war started, do you remember?</sentence><sentence id="87">Or do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Yes, I do know.</sentence><sentence id="95">Okay, on August 23"4 1939, when the Soviets and Nazis signed a non- aggression pact, there was the fear of war in the <span class="DLF">air</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">This was particularly true with respect to my father.</sentence><sentence id="97">When the Nazis got into power, they established all kinds of trade restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="98">My father was exporting feathers to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">While he was visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he was arrested, allegedly for breaking their trade ru-rules.</sentence><sentence id="100">He was able to post bail, and he actually jumped bail.</sentence><sentence id="101">So he knew that if Nazis ever got into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, that he would be picked up.</sentence><sentence id="102">With the encouragement of my mother who said to him that if you are in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you will be arrested, if you're out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, you may be he -- able to help us, she encouraged him to promptly leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="103">It being late August, my father's parents, being religious, said, the high holidays are coming, you should wait and leave until after the holidays.</sentence><sentence id="104">Well, my father left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdynia</span>, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> in late August, with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to leave a <span class="DLF">Polish port</span> before the war started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="116">Q: Wow.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="118">A: While he was in the middle of the Atlantic, September first came along, with the outbreak of the war, and clearly, if he had listened to his parents rather than his wife, I wouldn't be here.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="120">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="121">Now, you s -- you were very young, so do you have any recollections from your own memory of your father leaving?</sentence><sentence id="122">Do you remember that day, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: [remember that my father would take a number of trips, but I can't tell you at this point that I remember this departure.</sentence><sentence id="124">He had previously gone to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, where s -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was going, on -- on a -- business trips.</sentence><sentence id="125">So I think to my young mind, the difference between this business trip and other business trips, was not apparent.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="127">Do you remember feeling any anxiety in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because of a possible war and then the war coming?</sentence><sentence id="128">Do you -- do you have a recollection of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Well, my recollection is that when the war came, we fled to my father's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, ni -- which was relatively close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">In my own mind, and perhaps this is fantasizing, I think of Werdiswow as being the Anna Tefka.</sentence><sentence id="137">And as -- so we felt it being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, it was a quote, safer <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be with the Nazis swarming all over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: So it was you and your mother, your two sisters, and anyone else?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Well, when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span>, we were with my father's extended family, his parents.</sentence><sentence id="144">He was one of seven children, there were three boys and four girls, and my father was the oldest, and so there were a lot of Belfers around in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werdiswow</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: And you know, some of them had children, and I suspect that there were, you know, close family friends.</sentence><sentence id="150">So I do remember that one night when the Nazis were first invading, we spent the night on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, somehow feeling that that was safer than staying in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">That there was the noise of artillery in the background.</sentence><sentence id="152">And I am told a story about myself which perhaps is -- should embarrass me, but it doesn't, that apparently in the middle of the night, I got up, I felt the full bladder, and just relieved myself to the expense of a sleeping neighbor.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="157">Q: And who told you this story?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: My parents, and my sisters would tease me about it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="162">Now, you had two older sisters.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Can you give us their names, please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Yes, there was my sister Selma who was three years older, and my sister Anita who was just one year older than I.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Do you remember them in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>?</sentence><sentence id="177">Do you remember being with them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="180">A: Well, I remember that my sister Anita, who was then called Hanka by her Polish name, had a nanny maid by the name of Topja.</sentence><sentence id="181">And apparently Topja wa -- who was su -- probably supposed to be looking after all three of us, seemed to favor Hanka, or Anita.</sentence><sentence id="182">Also remember being told that when she was two and I was one, that I was as big as she was.</sentence><sentence id="183">And, by the way, I was told that I was a 10 pound baby.</sentence><sentence id="184">Obviously I can't prove it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="191">That's pretty big.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: And that I was a much better eater, you know, and that I would eat the food off Hanka's plate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="196">Q: With her permission, or you simply went there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="198">A: Well, she would, I think ha -- was happily acquiescing at being relieved of the burden of eating.</sentence><sentence id="199">Having grandchildren of various temperaments --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="200">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: -- [know some of them are more like I-I am, and some are more like my sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="204">Let me go back for a second.</sentence><sentence id="205">You -- because not everybody who watches this will know what you meant when you said -- when you went to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> it was like Anna Tefka to you.</sentence><sentence id="206">What does that mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: That it would be a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">east European village</span> with largely unpaved <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and probably chickens running around the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and most of the men being bearded, and Yiddish being spoken --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: -- much more so than Polish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: And Anna Tefka actually refers to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in a musical, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Yes, that's -- it is the name of the -- a fictional <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in "Fiddler on the Roof."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Which of course has now become an American icon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="230">Your -- where did your father go when he left?</sentence><sentence id="231">He didn't get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: Wa -- he did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: He did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="240">By that -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> on which he was on sailed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">He was permitted entry to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a business person on a business visa.</sentence><sentence id="242">While he was in the middle of the Atlantic, the zlotys, the Polish currency that he had with him became worthless overnight.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: When he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span>, he was given five dollars by HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and -- in order to have the wherewithal to get off.</sentence><sentence id="250">And he made contact, reme -- as I said before, he had been to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> previously.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: He had business contacts, and they initially helped him out and he went to work for them, initially as an employee, and he shou -- he shortly became their partner.</sentence><sentence id="256">Because he was aware that the war had actually broken out, and because wars create scarcity, when he used his business contacts to send cables to -- which was the pre-internet way of communicating --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: -- to Europe, asking for quotations on feathers and down.</sentence><sentence id="259">And whatever quote he got, which was then above the <span class="BUILDING">market</span>, he responded yes.</sentence><sentence id="260">When the merchandise arrived, and the fact of the war had been more widely recognized, the feathers and downs had appreciated in value, he was able to then sell them at a profit and get started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: Huh.</sentence><sentence id="271">Now, was he able to communicate with your -- with your mother and the family at all, do you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: There -- the mail service was working.</sentence><sentence id="275">I think that there was an exchange of letters.</sentence><sentence id="276">I don't -- don't believe there was any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephones</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: -- that time that were functioning on a <span class="COUNTRY">US</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- to <span class="REGION">occupied Poland</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: -- relationship.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: You don't have those letters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: No, I do not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: No.</sentence><sentence id="288">So how long was you father in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="291">A: Well, the -- my -- because he had a business visa, rather than an immigration visa, he had -- he applied as a hardship case as a refugee from a occupied <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">But he had to leave the US.and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and -- to be permitted to re-enter the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on an immigrant status.</sentence><sentence id="293">Obviously with the war raging in Europe, he was happy to be able to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span></sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="299">Now, in the meantime, your mother is trying to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="302">A: Now, in the meantime my father was preoccupied not only with trying to make a buck, but getting his family out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">And he had with him -- and I'm hoping I can actually get you a copy of what I would call a life-saving photograph.</sentence><sentence id="304">It was a picture of his wife and three children that he had with him, and utilizing that picture, and -- let's just say the cooperation of the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> of the Republic of Nicaragua, he was able to obtain for his family, citizenship papers of <span class="COUNTRY">Nicaragua</span>, then a neutral country.</sentence><sentence id="305">My mother won -- who was a little bit older than my father, grew up when there was no <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">It was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and so she</sentence><sentence id="308">spoke a perfect Hoke Deutsch.</sentence><sentence id="309">And the Germans -- I mean, I can go into some detail about her contacts with them, did not speak Spanish, and so she conversed with them as a citizen of a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, not as a Jew, not as a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="310">To the best of my knowledge, she ne -- we never had to wear yellow stars.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Hm.</sentence><sentence id="323">So she's communicating in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: So as -- as the holder of a citizenship papers of <span class="COUNTRY">Nicaragua</span>, she applied to leave the Third Reich.</sentence><sentence id="327">She was told that in order to leave the Third Reich, that she had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">But if I may, there are a couple of things that I do remember before our departure for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Absolutely, tell me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Well, I remember that it snowed a lot, and that I remember holding my mother's hand as we walked the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, and the way that snow gets shoveled into piles on the edge of the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>, it seemed to me as a little kid that the piles of snow were as tall as I was.</sentence><sentence id="335">I remember that if we would walk in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and we'd come across Nazi s-soldiers, that well, you could -- my -- my mother would definitely show fear which I could feel.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="338">Q: Cause you were holding her hand.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Yeah, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: So did she grab you tightly?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: I think she -- I think that she would hold onto me a little tighter.</sentence><sentence id="345">Now, I have shown you some pictures of myself, probably taken in the summer of "39.</sentence><sentence id="346">And modesty aside, I had blue eyes, and blonde golden curls.</sentence><sentence id="347">And there was a fear that the Germans would take some eastern European children who looked like Aryans, take them away from their family and raise them as Germans.</sentence><sentence id="348">So my mother cut ou -- had all my hair cut off to make me look less enticing to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="349">My</sentence><sentence id="351">hair never grew back blonde.</sentence><sentence id="352">I'm sure it wouldn't have -- it would have turned color anyway, but it's a story that I mi -- that I kind of enjoy telling.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Did she actually cut off all your hair?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: I can't say that I have any pictures of myself post haircut, so I can't give you a precise answer, but certainly you can see from the photos I have, that I had an abundance of golden curls.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="369">Which were cut off.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="375">Do you remember seeing these Nazi soldiers when you were walking?</sentence><sentence id="376">Or do you only remember your mother's response, do you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="380">A: So -- I know I remember seeing Nazi soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and subsequently when we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madrid</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="382">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: So I can't be sure --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: Where, yeah, right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="386">A: -- just where I saw them --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="387">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: -- but I certainly do remember.</sentence><sentence id="389">Also, I miss -- I -- I also remember very clearly my -- a German officer would knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, accompanied by one or two soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="390">And they would refer to my mother, who spoke perfect German, as [indecipherable] frau, gracious lady, which was the appropriate way to greet a respected stranger.</sentence><sentence id="391">And they would come and borrow a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> for the duration of the war.</sentence><sentence id="392">In short, they stole it.</sentence><sentence id="395">0 And because there was this polite officer, you know, who request -- or looked very tall to me, as did most adults.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="404">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
