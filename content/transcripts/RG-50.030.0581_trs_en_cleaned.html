<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Can you describe what sort of anti-Semitism he noticed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Well -- well, what I do remember, his telling me about the complaint that too many Jews were trying to get out of serving in the army.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, the German government decided to have a census of how many Jews were serving in the</sentence><sentence id="48">Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010 German army.</sentence><sentence id="49">When the findings were that the Jews were overrepresented in the army, the results were not published, not until the late 20s.</sentence><sentence id="50">But -- so he was drafted as a private and ended his service as a private, as did most Jews.</sentence><sentence id="51">I mean, if you were a physician or a dentist, you might become an officer, but by and large Jews were not considered qualified to be in combat, and so he spent his period of time in the transportation system, which meant looking after horses, because that was the main vehicle transportation.</sentence><sentence id="52">So, I remember these things, I'm sure, not when I was -- before going to <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">But I had always someone, a -- a caretaker, looking after the smaller children, or taking us to an aunt and uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, who had a child my age.</sentence><sentence id="54">So this is how I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, but I do not recall having any non- Jewish German friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: What sort of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you attend?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: What?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: What sort of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> did you attend?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: Well, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span>, of which -- of the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="73">We lived there, nearby, walking distance, and I do remember being attacked sometimes by other kids, ger -- who didn't like Jewish kids, and you had to fight.</sentence><sentence id="74">And so I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which was not a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span>; we had, I would say, very poor teachers.</sentence><sentence id="75">And I was kind of a rebellious, problematic child.</sentence><sentence id="76">I would talk back to the</sentence><sentence id="78">Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010 teachers sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="79">And at one point, a teacher called me a donkey.</sentence><sentence id="80">And so I said, well if I am a donkey, you are a monkey.</sentence><sentence id="81">And the teacher was so upset.</sentence><sentence id="82">And finally my parents bribed me to apologize, even though I -- they agreed I -- it was justified for me to talk back.</sentence><sentence id="83">But as soon as -- after four years, I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> as in -- they call it in German.</sentence><sentence id="84">And in the middle of that year, that was in 1933, the government decided that no Jewish child should be allowed to go to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, and so I was notified that I could not continue, in 1934.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Let me step back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="100">Before "33, how aware of you what -- were you of the political unrest that was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>?</sentence><sentence id="101">Did you witness any political rallies?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="105">A: Well, strange is, I do remember being very interested in what was going on, and reading the newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="106">Now, of course, I had two older brothers, who were educationally very active, so I would say at age eight and nine, I was very much aware of elections, and the propaganda in elections and the Nazi party, and the Nationalists, who were close to the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="107">So certainly I have very vivid memories of 1932 and 1933.</sentence><sentence id="108">But I do not recall ever feeling frightened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: When the results of the plebiscite were announced in "32, and they announced that Hitler had won, what was the immediate reaction in your family?</sentence><sentence id="114">Did people take it seriously?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Well, my father at that point lost his job, because the company for which he w -- he had to give up his business because of the depression.</sentence><sentence id="122">It was based in -- a lot on export of shaving brushes to other <span class="REGION">European countries</span>, and he had traveled a great deal to different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, and as a result I became a stamp collector.</sentence><sentence id="123">But he lost his business because in the depression there just wasn't enough, so he worked for a company selling their c -- shaving brushes.</sentence><sentence id="124">And he lost the job.</sentence><sentence id="125">And I remember in 19 -- you know, in January and February 1933, when Hitler came into power, that this was pretty bad, but we didn't think it was a catastrophe.</sentence><sentence id="126">It wouldn't last, after all, the Nazi party was not a majority, but close to it.</sentence><sentence id="127">And I remember my father, for example, printing advertisements to announce that he was making men's suits to -- for measure.</sentence><sentence id="128">He hired tailors to do the work, and he would find customers and take their measurements and sell tailor made clothing, which in those days was a very common thing, I mean, you didn't have the mass production.</sentence><sentence id="129">And so he had advertisements printed, and when I was out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or had a day off, I would take these ads and put them into <span class="DLF">mailboxes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">My first <span class="BUILDING">job</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">So he, even though there was a Nazi boycott, he continued to try and sell, although gradually the business stopped, because it was dangerous and counterproductive for Germans to do business with any Jew.</sentence><sentence id="132">So, in 1934 -"35, he effectively ceased having an income.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Now, did you witness any of the Nuremberg rallies in the first year?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="149">Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: No, no I-- I was aware of them.</sentence><sentence id="151">I was aware of the Stiirmer newspaper, that came out every week, but the Jewish youth groups to which I belonged, a religious Zionist group called Esba(ph) continued to function.</sentence><sentence id="152">We went on hiking trips and -- and at that time, while I do remember the boycott of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish businesses</span> on April 1deg, 1933, being surprised how many <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="153">So this -- a friend walking around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, I said, good God, these are Jew -- all Jewish, because they were being boycotted, but I wasn't have a -- didn't have a sense of fear.</sentence><sentence id="154">And once on a hike, a group of Nazi SS troops told us we had to break up <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">But again, no sense of fear that anything would happen to me.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, I was spared the frightening experiences of Jews after 1937 - deg38, when there was a great deal of physical abuse.</sentence><sentence id="157">There were some Jews arrested in "33, and a few were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, but I didn't -- my family didn't know any of them, so that I would say -- when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I never had experienced the sense of physical fear, because that came later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="166">Q: Let me go back, when you mentioned that you were expelled from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, can you sort of describe that day, how you found out that you were no longer allowed to attend the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, how you filled up your days afterwards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, that is interesting.</sentence><sentence id="169">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, there was a complete shift, because since I--I was a fairly good student, very good student in fact, but had very bad</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="173">Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010 relationships with the teachers, who found that I asked too many questions and you know, there were all kinds of religious instruction and I wasn't quite sure, and asked questions.</sentence><sentence id="174">So, we had problems.</sentence><sentence id="175">So when I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, everything changed.</sentence><sentence id="176">I was a good student, the student -- the teachers liked me.</sentence><sentence id="177">When the teachers ran out of booklets for examinations, he would send me to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> nearby to pick them up.</sentence><sentence id="178">And I remember one time he says, oh you can't go to this <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, because it's owned by a Jew, you have to go to that <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">I didn't like that, but -- I was well regarded in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and one day found out that -- that all -- not only I, but other Jewish children had to leave, and -- well, that's politics.</sentence><sentence id="180">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> -- by that time I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, my family had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and there they had a very good <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, whose teachers, many of them were college professors who had lost their jobs, who later on sometimes became quite famous individually, as scholars in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">So, I went for one year to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Griinewald</span>, from which, by the way, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> were deported from that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">And so I would say I did not, as I said, I-- I knew what was going on, because I listened to the news, and read the newspapers and talked to friends about what was happening.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="183">Q2: Can I just interject a question?</sentence><sentence id="184"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> had the odious distinction of having Julius Streicher as the gauleiter, the Nazi leader of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Franconia</span>, and also the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="187">publisher of "Der Stiirmer," and I was just wondering, you know, about how visible was "Der Stiirmer" --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Very visible.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: -- and -- and what kind of response did it generate among --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: I mean, since I didn't have any German friends -- I mean, we had a German maid, two German maids, we never talked about that.</sentence><sentence id="192">I didn't talk to German -- non- Jewish German kids.</sentence><sentence id="193">You read the fr -- crazy, outrageous stories every week.</sentence><sentence id="194">I mean, I didn't buy the paper, but I looked at the <span class="BUILDING">newsstand</span>, at the front page.</sentence><sentence id="195">And well, this is Nazi, this is -- you s -- you s -- you grew up, you lived with this as part of the realities of life.</sentence><sentence id="196">Later on when I studied the history of my family, prior ge -- generations also had to sort of take the fact that there was anti-Semitism for granted, the way minorities today live in so many <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where there is governmentally supported discrimination.</sentence><sentence id="197">But, we talked about it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I think my parents decided, because of the history of all this, that there was no future for us in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, as early as 1933.</sentence><sentence id="198">Whereas so many German Jews thought this would pass the way it had always passed, and they delayed making a decision to leave.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Okay, let's talk about the decision to emigrate.</sentence><sentence id="200">Now, who is the first members of your family to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and what prompted them to go where they did, and</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Well, since my father had to go -- went backrumpt -- bankrupt when the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> could no longer sell enough, we didn't have the financial means to get an immigration visa from [indecipherable] <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, because in the early 30s there was a depression all over the world.</sentence><sentence id="209">Nobody wanted immigrants.</sentence><sentence id="210">It was very difficult to get visas, so it became clear that it would be very unlikely to be able to emigrate.</sentence><sentence id="211">We actually had distant relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who emigrated in the 19" century, but my father didn't know about them, because they were, you know, three or four generations back.</sentence><sentence id="212">So my two older brothers decided not to have an academic career, but to become Halutzim or physical laborers and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">And they succeeded.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: And what <span class="NPIP">year</span> was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: 735 and "36.</sentence><sentence id="223">And there was an opportunity for children to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under a special program to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and then return <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, hopefully.</sentence><sentence id="224">And my parent decided, with much discussion in -- within the larger family, to send my younger brother, who was 12, and me, who was 14 to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under this program where, in <span class="BUILDING">foster homes</span>, we would finish our education.</sentence><sentence id="225">And they were able to emigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Let's talk a little bit about this program.</sentence><sentence id="231">Can you -- a-actually want to go in two different directions, cause I want to talk about your parents" emigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="236">Interview with Joseph Eaton deg May 27, 2010 But first, can you describe the program that you were under; who subsidized it, was this through the Jewish community, was it general, what political ramifications were there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: Well, we all know historically that President Roosevelt took very little action to help the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">He had a congress that was not willing to change immigration laws.</sentence><sentence id="239">And within the Department of State, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> as well, the bureaucracy felt, whatever immigrants we get, we don't need Jews.</sentence><sentence id="240">And so they made it especially difficult for Jews to get papers, unless they had very good connections in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">But, under pressure, Roosevelt agreed to commit, I don't know how many, whether it was 2,000 or 20,000 children from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under a guarantee of the Jewish community that they would not become a burden to the welfare system.</sentence><sentence id="242">It was called the German Jewish Children's Aid Society.</sentence><sentence id="243">And I think my younger brother was on the first group, and I came a week later on the second group --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: What year and month was that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: -- traveling on the S.S. Harding.</sentence><sentence id="246">And while it was upsetting, I -- I felt, and my parents reinforced this, this was a temporary thing, and that we would be reunited after they got out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">And so I landed the day before Thanksgiving of 1934, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and was temporarily picked up to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of one of the</sentence><sentence id="249">Interview with Joseph Eaton 8 May 27, 2010 officers of the German Jewish Children's Society, a attorney, John L.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: I want to come back later and ask you about what it was like living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> without parents, but why don't we jump over to your parents.</sentence><sentence id="259">After you and your siblings all left, where did they go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: Well, actually, my parents" marriage was -- did not come -- it sort of deteriorated as he lost his business.</sentence><sentence id="263">My mother was an intellectual.</sentence><sentence id="264">He was interested in things, but really did not share her intellectual interests.</sentence><sentence id="265">And so the marriage was not a good marriage, but I didn't know about that.</sentence><sentence id="266">My older brothers did, and they did divorce and emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> separately.</sentence><sentence id="267">And my father found another girlfriend and they emigrated together, also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">So it was a congenial divorce.</sentence><sentence id="269">There wasn't much to argue about in 1936, although emotionally this was a very difficult thing for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="270">But she got a good deal of support from her family and her sisters.</sentence><sentence id="271">So -- however, there was a tremendous amount of correspondence between members of the family.</sentence><sentence id="272">I have letters, about this many, with my parents, my mother, my father, my brothers and we kept the letters.</sentence><sentence id="273">So, over the years, my brothers gave me the letters, because I was the only one in the family who showed interest, and of course, the only one who could read German.</sentence><sentence id="274">So I have a tremendous collection of letters, and I have to decide what to do with</sentence><sentence id="276">them, because I don't think I have the time right now to go through them.</sentence><sentence id="277">But they present a great deal of day to day information of how a normal refugee family dealt with the realities of emigration, adjustment, what -- interrelationships.</sentence><sentence id="278">Today this would never happen.</sentence><sentence id="279">People might communicate by email, but in those days, letter writing was the only means of communication.</sentence><sentence id="280">And it meant having -- spending money on postage, which for my parents was not easy.</sentence><sentence id="281">So, most of the letters, th-the -- every inch of the paper was filled with words.</sentence><sentence id="282">In other words, you didn't have any margins, to save money.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: What was -- how late were you able to keep up the correspondence?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="699">Q: Let me just interject one question, and then we'll talk about the transfer.</sentence><sentence id="700">What was your official citizenship status at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="703">A: I was an enemy alien, and I was drafted as an enemy alien.</sentence><sentence id="704">And as an enemy alien, I was obviously under FBI surveillance.</sentence><sentence id="705">I know this because in 1942 I received a postcard from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, from an aunt, saying that they needed money so that they might be able to get a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Ecuador</span> for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="706">And they didn't have money, could I raise 12,000 dollars?</sentence><sentence id="707">And within two days or so after I got the postcard, the FBI came to my <span class="DLF">door</span> and asked me if I had sent any money, pointing out to me that this was trading with the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="708">Well, I didn't have any money, I didn't know anybody I could get 12,000 dollars from.</sentence><sentence id="709">But I know, obviously my mail was being monitored.</sentence><sentence id="710">And, you know, the -- they did say to me, it's just as well you didn't send them any money, because this is just a scam, as far as we know.</sentence><sentence id="711">But my mail was being censored, without ever being notified.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="721">Q: So, now as an enemy alien, you're in the army --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="722">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="727">Q: -- and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="728">A: So we're as -- but the fact that I was drafted, this didn't seem to bother anybody.</sentence><sentence id="729">So it might have meant that I might have been promoted more quickly, that could be a factor, because I was ap -- still a private after s-several months in a really important position in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="730">In other words, I was in charge of the night shift, and when people came in, they depended on me to keep the records straight, and that had been, apparently, a real problem, simply because it wasn't always easy to get the right people to do the job.</sentence><sentence id="731">Well educated people usually were assigned to other <span class="BUILDING">jobs</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="736">Q: And then why did you leave this <span class="BUILDING">job</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="738">A: So, what happened, and I only learned that later, is that when you're drafted -- in World War II, the army had adopted the IBM technology to keep personnel records, so that every soldier, when he was drafted, had -- was interviewed in great detail about their background, and all of that was put on IBM cards.</sentence><sentence id="739">And in 1942, or was it f-- or early 43, I'm not sure exactly, the U.S. government had decided that when we liberate <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the U.S. would need to govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="740">Roosevelt did not trust de Gaulle, whom he regarded as an extreme nationalist who would undermine the recovery of Europe, as happened in wor -- after World War I, when the French were -- insisted on the Versailles treaty.</sentence><sentence id="741">So, he decided he wasn't going to let the</sentence><sentence id="743">Interview with Joseph Eaton % August 1, 2010 free French govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, but there would be a U.S. military government of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, then there would be free election, and let the French decide whether they want de Gaulle or somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="744">So in preparation for the liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, they were going to train a cadre of people to govern <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="745">And even though I didn't know French, but becu -- my card fell out and they decided I was one of these people, so suddenly I was transferred from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Rucker</span>, <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Queens College</span>, New York, to learn how to be one of the military government staff.</sentence><sentence id="746">French economics, French history, French law.</sentence><sentence id="747">The f-- the -- the taxation system and so on, so for six months I learned a great deal about <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and learned enough French so I could go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and pass my French language exam, because at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> you had to have two foreign languages if you wanted a PhD. They accepted my German and I passed the French exam, I learned enough.</sentence><sentence id="748">And we were about ready to be shipped over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to work with the English, who had reluctantly accepted the policy of Roosevelt, when Roosevelt and Churchill met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">And there Churchill convinced Roosevelt that the free French, de Gaulle should govern the <span class="REGION">occupied France</span>, that with all the problems that de Gaulle might create, it was better than the English and Americans tr -- doing the job.</sentence><sentence id="750">So overnight, about 10,000 bright American soldiers became surplus, and had to be reassigned, and our -- overnight, our program was finished.</sentence><sentence id="751">I mean, you know,</sentence><sentence id="753">Interview with Joseph Eaton %8 August 1, 2010 when you come to think of it, right in the middle of it, there was no longer any need to train people to govern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">And most of the trainees were reassigned to different divisions.</sentence><sentence id="755">Many military units had a shortage of people with high IQs.</sentence><sentence id="756">And this was an opportunity for the army to infuse more people with high 1Qs.</sentence><sentence id="757">But a few were given a choice, because the army was trying to fill some special jobs.</sentence><sentence id="758">And one of them was a unit that would be dropped to sabotage German facilities, dropped over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">And so I was interviewed and told that that was an opportunity for me, but they warned me that the chances of surviving were less than 50 percent, and what would be involved.</sentence><sentence id="760">And not that I was particularly heroic and wanting such a --a job, but I didn't feel as a Jew I could say no, so I--I said yes, when I really wa -- wished I didn't have to say yes.</sentence><sentence id="761">So, as a result, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span>, the U.S. intelligence training area near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span></sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: Can you tell me about the type of training you got at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span>, and who the other soldiers were who you met there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="789">A: Well, shortly after I arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span> it became clear the govern -- the army had decided that the program of dropping people didn't work, the Germans were too well organized.</sentence><sentence id="790">So actually I found myself attached to another unit, the psychological warfare division of the U.S. Army.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="793">Q: Now --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="799">A: -- and that psychological warfare division had very interesting responsibilities of providing intelligence at the division, as well as at the supreme headquarter level.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="801">Q: I want to talk in detail about what you did in PSYOPS, but can you first tell me about who the other people were in your -- in the division and in your unit?</sentence><sentence id="802">What types of people were recruited for this work?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="805">A: In the psychological warfare division, the key person was a Austrian named Captain Hans Harber(ph), and he had become important because he -- he married the daughter of -- the father of Ted Kennedy and the other Kennedys, who had been ambassador to Great Britain.</sentence><sentence id="806">The way Hans Harber(ph), who was himself a refugee from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> -- he became extremely well-known because of his personal history.</sentence><sentence id="807">Harbie(ph) was the son of a Hungarian Jew named Baeckeshee(ph), who edited the scandal sheet of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and who had shot himself in the foot in World War I, so he wouldn't have to serve.</sentence><sentence id="808">And Hans had been very ashamed of his father when the war broke out in-- World War II, in "39, he signed up in the Foreign Legion and was taken prisoner by the Germans and escaped, and wrote a book about the whole situation; his service, his family, and it became a best seller.</sentence><sentence id="809">So this is how, because of the book, he was invited to lecture all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and Europe, and this is how he met his future wife.</sentence><sentence id="810">And then he signed up in the American army, and he dising -- distinguished himself in <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="811">He was a</sentence><sentence id="813">journalist who had studied the history of Hitler and his family.</sentence><sentence id="814">So he was appointed to head the psychological warfare units, and was regarded by top level executives as a intelligent, sophisticated analyst of what was going on in Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="826">Q: Now, before you could b -- enter psy -- the PSYOPS division, did you have to undergo any security clearances, any other special exams?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="828">A: If I did, they h-had all the information about me, so I-- I would -- I do not recall.</sentence><sentence id="829">My hunch is they did make the security clearance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="832">Q: And what sort of special training did they give you at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="834">A: Well, the training we got was a a-analysis of how the German army was structured; tactically, strategically, chains of command.</sentence><sentence id="835">We studied the German propaganda techniques.</sentence><sentence id="836">We studied the British American policies that Harber(ph) had worked out with the British, which contrasted to the Hollywood approach, that at the beginning had been kind of adopted, a kind of advertising that we have now, in which you oftentime make claims that are not -- that are misleading.</sentence><sentence id="837">The British had decided before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.038" long="2.378">Dunkirk</span>, that the only way they could win in Europe is to adopt a policy of always telling the truth.</sentence><sentence id="838">So at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.038" long="2.378">Dunkirk</span> they reported their defeat, the problems of evacuating everybody, the losses, and they broadcast these facts to the Germans over BBC, and the French and so on.</sentence><sentence id="839">And you know what, they were facing a tremendous loss, had the Germans had succeeded, and continued this</sentence><sentence id="841">Interview with Joseph Eaton deg August 1, 2010 policy and psychological warfare had adopted the policy of not using propaganda, they -- you know, the way Americans advertise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="852">Q: And how did they define your mission?</sentence><sentence id="853">Did you have a mission statement?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="856">A: The mission statement was to get the Germans as -- first of all, to believe in what they were being told by the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and by the British, and second, to get the Germans to question their regime, on the basis of what was difficult for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="857">In other words, we'd -- we -- to simply say the Germans were unfair and unjust and so on, wasn't going to work, because they felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in order to survive, had to do some terrible things, that's war.</sentence><sentence id="858">We had to focus on inconsistencies in German policies from the point of view of the German public and the differentiation between what was good for the general public, and what was good to the me -- for the maintenance of the regime.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="862">Q: And did you begin any of the actual work while you were still in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="863">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="864">Q: -- or was this all pre --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: We -- we wrote leaflets to be dropped.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="866">Q: While you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="872">A: While we da -- we had to find our way blind, men left all by ourselves somewhere in -- in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="873">We had to write reports to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="874">It turned out later on, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> I was attached to was directly attached to Eisenhower's supreme headquarters, so we were reporting directly.</sentence><sentence id="875">Ha-Ha-Harber(ph) obviously was given that job, and so the 10 people he had selected automatically got jobs that had actually impact on public policy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="880">Q: And when did your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> ship out to Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="882">A: We shipped out in "43, and were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, there to work with the British and get trained for British American cooperation.</sentence><sentence id="883">We had -- that time we had not yet attacked Europe at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span>, but we were being readied for that event.</sentence><sentence id="884">We knew that sooner or later we would invade Europe, but of course we didn't know when it would happen.</sentence><sentence id="885">But that was our training.</sentence><sentence id="886">And especially writing reports, working with British -- actually, we were being investigated carefully by British intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="887">They didn't trust -- and I learned later that the Americans, our particular unit was sent to a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, which was very comfortable, but of course the blitz was going on.</sentence><sentence id="888">Any time you got hit by a bomb, that was it, a whole <span class="DLF">block</span> would be wiped out by one bomb.</sentence><sentence id="889">And -- but the <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> were run by women -- British women soldiers, who did -- who fed us, who looked after our clothes, who woke us up in the morning, who made sure that we had, you</sentence><sentence id="891">know, were properly fed and had all the comforts.</sentence><sentence id="892">What we didn't realize, that they also were carefully making notes on all of us, and had conversations.</sentence><sentence id="893">Their job was to make sure that we would be able to function in a proper fashion.</sentence><sentence id="894">And then, about five weeks after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, we landed at <span class="DLF">Omaha Beach</span> at a time when it was no longer dangerous, because actually, American troops had liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="895">So we landed and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> waiting, and we drove directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="911">Q: Now, won't you tell me about what your day to day work was?</sentence><sentence id="912">And I know that you were writing leaflets, but what was the source of information, how did you get the information that you we -- based on your reports, and how did you decide what went into the reports that you were writing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="915">A: Well, the leaflets had to appeal to Germans.</sentence><sentence id="916">So what we did is we looked at the tactical situation, and then presented it to the Germans as this is what is happening in the battlefields.</sentence><sentence id="917">And giving them facts about what was going on, which by 1940 -- late 1943 - 1944 was no longer entirely favorable to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="918">I mean, we were still incurring losses, but we were beginning -- you know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> we actually were able to defeat Rommel and prevent the capture of <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="919">So, depending on what happened that day, we would write a leaflet, and then we would think of some other things that might make Germans question the policies of their government.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="931">Q: And how independent were you in terms of what you put in?</sentence><sentence id="932">Who had to approve these leaflets?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="935">A: The 10 men working in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">teams</span> of one or two or thr -- not more than that, would prepare a leaflet, or a news broadcast, and they would be reviewed by Captain Harber(ph).</sentence><sentence id="936">And he had the authority to say yes or no.</sentence><sentence id="937">There was a colonel, but the colonel was somebody who had come from the broadcasting industry, who worked well with Harber(ph), but really Harber(ph) was the authority, as somebody who understood what was going on in Europe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="941">Q: And how did you disseminate these leaflets once you wrote them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="943">A: Well, we did nothing, they were just -- they were just exercises.</sentence><sentence id="944">The -- I think at times -- no, I don't think, I know at times our products were shown to high officials, probably Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower, to give them an idea what psychological w-warfare we'd be doing.</sentence><sentence id="945">But it was all practice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="949">Q: So none of these ever made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="952">They -- they may very well have been dropped.</sentence><sentence id="953">Certainly I knew that once we were at <span class="BUILDING">Radio Luxembourg</span>, everything we did was being dropped.</sentence><sentence id="954">I don't know whether, before we actually occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, and Radio Luxembourg, and operated from there, whether the British had decided that simply it was enough to have the BBC, simply because to drop leaflets meant to use <span class="DLF">air</span></sentence><sentence id="956">power, and every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> we could spare was being used to bomb.</sentence><sentence id="957">So I sort of doubt that they would drop leaflets, when we had no capacity to occupy, to get Germans to surrender, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="958">So I'm not sure that -- there may have been some tactical use used in the radio brod -- broadcast, but -- but we didn't get that kind of feedback.</sentence><sentence id="959">But I doubt very much that we dropped any leaflets before we were in a capacity to take prisoners.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1117">A: The British opposed the idea of focusing on the persecution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1118">They took the position that -- a-and a correct position -- Hitler was again and again reminding Germans that there wouldn't be a war, except for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1119">And of course, Roosevelt was -- was -- had his name changed from Rosenfeld(ph) to Roosevelt and that if it weren't for the Jews, nobody would oppose Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="1120">And the British took the position that focusing on the atrocities would only reinforce the idea that this is what the war was all about.</sentence><sentence id="1121">So you had to get special permission to make any reference to the persecution of the Jews on our news broadcasts.</sentence></p></dialogue>

longer a soldier, he said, I'm a civilian now, but he decided that as a former general, he might be considered someone to be made a prisoner of war, he hoped this would not be the case, but this is why he let the message be transmitted that he was ready to be in touch with the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="1304">He indicated in conversations about the war, I learned -- he and I talked about his

stayed in the Austrian army and then when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, he became part of the German army.</sentence><sentence id="1307">And he

today?</sentence><sentence id="1323">He said, we've lost the war, we have to accept unconditional surrender, because every day major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German villages</span> and <span

to tell this to the German population if you had a chance?</sentence><sentence id="1326">He says, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1327">And then I told him that he was a lucky man, that he had the opportunity to do this right now, because there was a <span class="BUILDING">broadcasting station</span> in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1328">So he got caught, and I gave him a pen and paper, and I found he had great difficulty writing a script, so I offered to write it, help him draft it.</sentence><sentence id="1329">Well, what are you going to say?</sentence><sentence id="1330">He said okay, and I drafted a speech, thinking in terms of what is he likely to say?</sentence><sentence id="1331">So, you know, he wasn't advocating to surrender, because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had done terrible things.</sentence><sentence id="1332">He -- he had no regrets about moving into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and whatever he-helped in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and you know, every</sentence><sentence id="1334">command was one that he tried to execute.</sentence><sentence id="1335">He simply was willing to surrender because it was better for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1336">So he modified my remarks, his German was much better than mine.</sentence><sentence id="1337">And then I said let's -- I sat him into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> doing exactly what you are doing, and we listened to the broadcast.</sentence><sentence id="1338">And then I had him do it two more times, because it didn't sound as good as I thought it wou -- should be.</sentence><sentence id="1339">And afterwards I told him that he should put on his uniform, and asked him if he had any weapons, and the only thing he had was a sword and a pistol, and I took both of those.</sentence><sentence id="1340">And he dressed in his army uniform and I said, well, I have to take you to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> to -- for them to decide whether you are to become a prisoner of war, or a civilian and could be treated as a civilian.</sentence><sentence id="1341">And so he gave me more papers to document his status.</sentence><sentence id="1342">And put him into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> late at night, the <span

Harber(ph), who had a good sense of humor says, Eaton, why don't you drive more carefully?</sentence><sentence id="1345">And after telling him a little bit more about the general, I said, well, why

we -- the cook had prepared good breakfast, bacon and eggs and trimmings, and the colonel and majors and captains were all assembled.</sentence><sentence id="1351">There was one thing that I forgot to tell you, I had been told that the general was terribly worried about being taken prisoner by enlisted men, he thought he would be mistreated.</sentence><sentence id="1352">So I decided I would make myself an officer.</sentence><sentence id="1353">That was a risky thing to do, to impersonate an officer in the army.</sentence><sentence id="1354">But you know, we had a great deal of freedom in my cir -- in other words, there was nobody telling me what to do when I went to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1355">It was my decision to decide where, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to go to, whom to interview, which American officers to ask for cooperation.</sentence><sentence id="1356">So, before going up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>, early in the morning, about eight or 8:30, I asked Germans where there was a <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span>, and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span>, which wasn't open yet, rang the bell.</sentence><sentence id="1357">The druggist answered when he saw, I guess, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military truck</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and looked worried, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1358">And I said, I need a Band- Aid.</sentence><sentence id="1359">Well, that was an easy request.</sentence><sentence id="1360">So he immediately got a box of Band-Aids.</sentence><sentence id="1361">And ask him for a scissors and I cut two pieces of the rubberized part of the Band- Aid, which is white on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and put it on the helmet and promoted myself to captain.</sentence><sentence id="1362">And so, when I took the general into, you know, custody, I introduced myself as Captain Eaton, who had been sent by <span class="BUILDING">supreme headquarters</span> to accept his</sentence><sentence id="1364">surrender.</sentence><sentence id="1365">So, you know, he felt sort of pleased that somehow supreme <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> --and that may have had a fact -- an impact on his re-readiness to cooperate.</sentence><sentence id="1366">So I had told Harbie(ph) on the phone what I had done.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And when I arrived everybody treated me as Captain Eaton, and -- and my driver was sort of amazed that I -- nobody criticized me, and then afterwards a decision was made to clear with supreme headquarters what to do with the general, that we would use him to work for us at Radio Luxembourg, and in the -- the day or two that this might take, we put up the general in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and my job, I was in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with him, was to take him for walks, see to it that he got his rations, and talk to him.</sentence><sentence id="1368">And then introduce him, bring him to different officers who wanted to talk to him, for whatever information they were interested in.</sentence><sentence id="1369">And after da -- a day or two, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="1370">So I was able to talk to Captain Harber(ph), he said well, we are having problems with this man, and I don't know what's going to happen, but it doesn't look good, because some of the senior officials in Eisenhower's <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> are concerned over the fact that you took this general in <span class="REGION">Third Army territory</span> and brought him to <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span>, when according to army rules, which you didn't know and I didn't know, you f--- all prisoners of war have to be cleared through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1371">And you didn't clear him through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camp</span>, you took him directly to <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1473">Q: What happened to the broadcast?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1475">A: Nothing, it wasn't used.</sentence><sentence id="1476">Apparently, there was enough fear among the upper level staff that Patton would get furious if someone that was captured in his <span class="REGION">area</span> was not -- did not -- he did not have the opportunity to handle the whole situation.</sentence><sentence id="1477">And for that reason, rather than get into another controversy between Patton and Bradley and Eisenhower -- and there had been many controversies between them, I mean, they -- Patton was very egocentric -- the decision was made to return the captain to where we had taken him prisoner and then to notify the French, the free French, who had been asked to move into Treya(ph) as the Third Army was advancing, to come up and arrest him.</sentence><sentence id="1478">So my job, they says -- an-an -- and -- and -- and they said, we decided you should do the job.</sentence><sentence id="1479">So here was my -- I-I was given another driver, and it was my job to find the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I had taken him prisoner.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1485">Q: I want to shift the focus now.</sentence><sentence id="1486">We've been talking about your role as an American soldier and I want to talk about your attitudes as a Jewish soldier, and the war at this point is winding down.</sentence><sentence id="1487">I understand that you took advantage of the fact that you had use of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to actually explore and see what happened to your own family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1493">Interview with Joseph Eaton ~" August 1, 2010</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1494">A: Yeah, well, shortly before being sent overseas, apparently army policy was to naturalize enemy aliens, especially people like myself, who had a very high security position.</sentence><sentence id="1495">So I was given a three day leave to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to go before a judge who -- I don't think he ever tested me as normally citizenship people ar -- application for citizenship, with being in the army, it -- the whole thing was about five minutes.</sentence><sentence id="1496">And the -- so I had become a citizen.</sentence><sentence id="1497">The -- and I was a citizen in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and -- when serving over i-in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1498">The -- obviously w-we all knew what was -- that the Germans were murdering Jews in large numbers.</sentence><sentence id="1499">Exactly what was happening, we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1500">You heard rumors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, you heard -- you knew that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> many people were tortured, and some people were killed.</sentence><sentence id="1501">But you didn't know any of the full details at all.</sentence><sentence id="1502">And in my unit of 10 people, I think there were two who were not Jewish, all the others were.</sentence><sentence id="1503">And we didn't talk about being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1504">There were German refugees like myself and Captain Harber(ph), we knew had been born into a Jewish family, but we didn't know what his sympathies were, that he had been converted.</sentence><sentence id="1505">And none of my fellow soldiers and I ever talked about the Jewish problem.</sentence><sentence id="1506">They didn't seem to ever talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And so, it -- it's something you kept to yourself, but I was very much aware, not only of what was -- we knew was happening to Jews, that they had been murdered in large numbers in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, that -- that we had heard.</sentence><sentence id="1508">But I also</sentence><sentence id="1510">Interview with Joseph Eaton degdeg August 1, 2010 knew that -- what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, so whenever there was news available, I was particularly interested in.</sentence><sentence id="1511">And so, as a result, I took a special interest in Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1512">And one of my assignments was to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as soon as we occupied a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148"

Jews, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148" long="6.1321494">Aachen</span>, which we occupied around oc -- middle of October, and I arrived there maybe two or three days after occupation, I learned from the public relations officer that one Jew had bi-- had survived.</sentence><sentence id="1515">And the army had seen to it that he would get as--a reasonable quarter, and he gave me the address.</sentence><sentence id="1516">So, I -- you know, I -- wasn't difficult to find out where to go, because you asked people, and he was put into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that had been -- the <span class="REGION">upper part</span> had been destroyed, but the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, the four <span class="DLF">walls</span> were standing, there were no <span class="DLF">windows</span>, the <span class="DLF">door</span> could not be closed, but it was better than most, you know, I-living in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1517">And he had put a big sign on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, Jude.</sentence><sentence id="1518">And so when I came in and introduced myself, he was very happy to see me.</sentence><sentence id="1519">He had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and insisted I sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, and he stood, in his warm clothing, he had no gloves.</sentence><sentence id="1520">So I gave him my gloves and a scarf, and we talked about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1521">And he explained to me that just before deportation, the Germans deported all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148" long="6.1321494">Aachen</span>, but because they had Christian friends, he and his wife were able to move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> and be hidden.</sentence><sentence id="1524">Interview with Joseph Eaton *" August 1, 2010 Unfortunately, his wife got caught in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and his -- was deported.</sentence><sentence id="1525">He -- but he survived.</sentence><sentence id="1526">And he described himself as being a member of the B'nai Brith and didn't know any Hebrew, but he had been to <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and knew something about prayers.</sentence><sentence id="1527">And he thought that probably he would be safe now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148" long="6.1321494">Aachen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1528">But -- and that's why he put the sign up, and he felt that he was -- he didn't know of any other Jew who survived.</sentence><sentence id="1529">Well, apparently the people in military government looked after him subsequently.</sentence><sentence id="1530">He was seep -- he got a job in military government as somebody who could be trusted, and ultimately turned out to be a member of the city council and became head of a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, because there were a few survivors who drifted back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.7571148" long="6.1321494">Aachen</span> and so the province decided to facilitate the development of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, and he actually became its head, I think, for the rest of his life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1571">Q: Did he have any details on where people were deported to, and what happened to them after they were deported?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1606">A: That was five, six days.</sentence><sentence id="1607">When I arrived, I inquired how -- how the former prisoners were being dealt with, and I quickly discovered that Jews had succeeded to be in a special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, even though originally, the Americans had decided that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> -- the people liberated, Poles would go into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and Yugoslavs and Germans, pris -- inmates, and then they discovered that the Jews didn't want to be with the Poles and didn't want to be with the Yugoslavs, and they simply refused.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1611">Interview with Joseph Eaton *8 August 1, 2010 So, the local commander said okay, I'll give you your own <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1612">And -- and that happened within -- on the first day.</sentence><sentence id="1613">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish barrack</span> and introduced myself, and we sat down, I said, what are the problems?</sentence><sentence id="1614">Are you getting enough food?</sentence><sentence id="1615">And they said, well, we're getting our share.</sentence><sentence id="1616">And -- but they were complaining about the administrative problems they had of getting recognized as a nationality.</sentence><sentence id="1617">So we discussed the political aspects, pointed out to them that the British government had a strong, vested interest in preventing the establishment of Jews as a separate nationality, because of what was th -- their commitment in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, that they had made a decision that they made a mistake in 1917, there were many more Arabs than Jews, and they didn't -- they didn't want to lose support of the Muslims, and so they had made an agreement, and until that can be overturned, the British were pushing very hard to oppose recognition of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1618">But on the other hand, Jews shouldn't be worried, and simply, they had the power to refuse.</sentence><sentence id="1619">They should insist on whatever they want, because there was strong political support of their position in the American Jewish community, and to some extent in the British community.</sentence><sentence id="1620">So they had done the right thing and they should be very assertive and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1621">So we talked about that, basically was mos -- much of the time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1622">In addition to getting information for my reports, that was the focus of my visit.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1623">After all, I only spent maybe four or five hours in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1626">Interview with Joseph Eaton 4 August 1, 2010</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1627">Q: Now, I know that one of your reports was on the children of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1628">Did you actually go into the <span class="BUILDING">children's barrack</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1629">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2148">that -- like a copy of "Mein Kampf" and photographic books of the fuehrer that came from his <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2149">And I had the <span class="BUILDING">printing office</span> make me a printed message that it was taken from Hitler's birthplace.</sentence><sentence id="2150">And then I met with the -- Mi-Miss Fagas(ph), and said, what are you going to do with Hitler's birthplace?</sentence><sentence id="2151">He says, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2152">It's certainly something you have to deal with.</sentence><sentence id="2153">I said, I have an idea, let's make it into a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> of the outra -- atrocities of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="2154">He liked that idea, and so he said, all right, we'll do it.</sentence><sentence id="2155">And, what are you going to exhibit?</sentence><sentence id="2156">Well, he said, that -- we have to get information of things that could be put there, like maybe the Nuremburg laws, and some of the info -- illustrations of Nazi's atrocities.</sentence><sentence id="2157">And I offered to get some placards that could be exhibited, and when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>, I got ahold of the local Catholic priest and told him that there was a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and I was wondering where there were some Biblical phrases that he could think of that would appropriately describe the evil of the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="2158">So --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2170">Q: What -- what sort of phrases did he come up with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2172">A: He came up by -- in my -- the material I gave you, the actual text from the Bible was selected, and I had them print it up on a large placard, and then took the material and they framed it, they -- I think they framed it for me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2173">The -- the Germans who had been running the <span class="BUILDING">Nazi printing plant</span> became my employees, because there was no one else.</sentence><sentence id="2174">In other words, we didn't replace them.</sentence><sentence id="2177">And they were very cooperative.</sentence><sentence id="2178">I never -- no one ever asked me about being Jewish, but I'm sure they all knew, and because you know, obviously, I spoke such good German, and my secretary, who was bi -- by that time was known she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2179">And there also was a incident, my fa -- my secretary, after she was freed, she had to fill out a questionnaire and she was afraid to reveal that she was not Polish.</sentence><sentence id="2180">She didn't trust the Germans, the -- our officers.</sentence><sentence id="2181">So she filled it out according to her false papers, not realizing that she was providing false information.</sentence><sentence id="2182">And when she openly admitted that she was of German background and of Jewish background and not Polish, the -- one of the -- the sia -- the security people decided she had violated the law, she had falsified her identity, and charged her for having done so.</sentence><sentence id="2183">I talked to them, and they says, we have no choice, she did it, and we have to prosecute.</sentence><sentence id="2184">So I wrote up a defense and there was a trial, so this was public.</sentence><sentence id="2185">The other thing that surely made clear to people that I was Jewish was the fact that I found out that there was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2186">And so they showed me where it was.</sentence><sentence id="2187">It was dirty and had been used as a <span class="INT_SPACE">storeroom</span>, but it hadn't been burned in Kristallnacht because it was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in a whole row of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, undistinguished, and if you had tried to burn it, you would have burned others -- <span class="NPIP">places</span> down.</sentence><sentence id="2188">So I decided it needed to be restored, and went to the German -- th-the -- well, I think the mayor actually came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when I asked for it.</sentence><sentence id="2189">I told him</sentence><sentence id="2191">this -- we had to clean up the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and I ask him also that this be done by people who had damaged it, if their names could be identified.</sentence><sentence id="2192">And he was not a Nazi, he had been put in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2193">So he was able apparently, to find out who did it, and so the members of the family, who had been in the SS or SA and had damaged the interior of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, had to come with brooms and paintbrushes and clean up the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2218">Q: Did you cover this in your <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2220">A: And that I put in the newspaper as a story, and again it was published all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2221">And the -- the interesting part was that one of the rabbis I just met now, in -- I th--I think it was the rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span>, actually had been -- there is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>, and it is operating.</sentence><sentence id="2222">It's not very large, but the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is being used.</sentence><sentence id="2223">So these kinds of things, I could do, simply because I had the authority to select what things to write about.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2232">A: Now, because my brother was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span>, and knew my address, and knew my telephone number, and he could tell people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span>, who were being released temporarily by the brigade, to organize the rescue of Jews in</sentence><sentence id="2234">Interview with Joseph Eaton "4 August 1, 2010 <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2235">The brigade just had enough autonomy to arrange their -- the mission -- the execution of the missions that they had, mostly transportation.</sentence><sentence id="2236">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to move from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and they did a lot of transporting.</sentence><sentence id="2237">So what they did is they organized their crews so that about two-thirds did the work and one-third were released to -- given ex-extended leave to go into <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> to either visit the s -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they came from, and to help Jews to organize, in order to get to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>, because th-there was no future for Jews in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2238">And in order to increase the number of Jews who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, you had to first bring them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2239">And so there were agents of the Jewish Brigade, whose job it was to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> is close to the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2240">So they had my name and telephone number so they could call me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and say they needed my advice, could I see them?</sentence><sentence id="2241">And I wo -- of course always would say yes.</sentence><sentence id="2242">And this way I became well-known, apparently, on this group of underground workers, and they would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> and they needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep at night, which I could provide, and food.</sentence><sentence id="2243">And then I would get them to the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2257">Q: Did anybody notice that you had these guests coming, mysterious guests, or were you able to keep it a secret?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2261">85 Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2262">A: Nobody paid much attention to what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="2263">That -- the Germans didn't pay -- you know, I had no one check on what I was doing and it was perfectly legitimate for the editor of the <span class="BUILDING">newspaper</span> to interview anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2264">So, it was reasonable for me to interview visiting dignitaries.</sentence><sentence id="2265">The fact that they ca-- happened to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> -- my commanding officer wasn't interest -- I mean, the -- he was not my commanding officer, because he had no authority over the newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="2266">He -- he was responsible for making sure my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> was operating properly and that I had the necessary fuel and food.</sentence><sentence id="2267">He wasn't at [indecipherable] the newspaper was not his job, so he didn't intervene at all.</sentence><sentence id="2268">I'm not sure he even looked at -- at the paper I put out.</sentence><sentence id="2269">He had a German girlfriend, and had a wonderful time, you know, had nothing to do, so I don't think he ever once ever asked me about my work, because my command was not -- he was not -- I was not under his command.</sentence><sentence id="2270">My commanding officer was, by that time, Major Hans Harber(ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span>, or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, where supreme <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were located.</sentence><sentence id="2271">That was my command.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2282">Q: And how long did you remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2284">A: Well, my job ended when the newspaper was turned over back to a German editorial board, about November deg45.</sentence><sentence id="2285">By that time, nearly all the newspapers, maybe with a week or two difference, were turned over to the Germans, and the program of U.S. operated German newspapers came to an end.</sentence><sentence id="2286">And I had</sentence><sentence id="2288">86 Interview with Joseph Eaton August 1, 2010 accumulated enough points to be sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2289">But because of the fact that there was a army program that permitted soldiers in Europe to visit relatives if they were available, I decided to take advantage of that, and I went, I think to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Nauheim</span>, and asked to meet with my brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2290">And that was approved, but a few hours later, while waiting around, I was told sorry, Sergeant Eaton, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> is closed.</sentence><sentence id="2291">The British have closed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Litwinski</span>, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, a recreational facility for American sailors and soldiers, and ask all Americans to leave.</sentence><sentence id="2292">There's no way for you to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because there were several generals who wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for Christmas, but who were refused.</sentence><sentence id="2293">So I f-- thought quickly, and said, but could I meet my brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2294">If you can get <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2295">So I gave them the address of a school friend at <span class="BUILDING">Cornell University</span>, a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span>, who had moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>, and I knew his address because he had sent me an invitation to his wedding in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2296">So I got permission to go [indecipherable] I wanted to see my brother, and so they approved it.</sentence><sentence id="2297">And when the orders were printed, they were printed like all other orders, to carry out the instructions of the commander, without specifying anything except I was put on detached duty for two weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> to carry out instructions of the theater commander.</sentence><sentence id="2298">That was Eisenhower.</sentence><sentence id="2299">So, my commanding officer, who knew why I was leaving, what I went doing, said that's wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2300">I don't care how long you</sentence><sentence id="2302">Interview with Joseph Eaton *7 August 1, 2010 stay, because when you g-go back, you going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2303">We don't need you any more.</sentence><sentence id="2304">So again, I'm not sure every commanding officer would have taken that position.</sentence><sentence id="2305">So, I had to find my way to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2306">Well, there was no -- I didn't get orders, transportation orders, because there was no way to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2307">So | packed up a duffel bag and hitchhiked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, because I knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> we had an <span class="BUILDING">air force base</span>, and I had found out that we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2308">So when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, I found out that there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>, but there were a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going to <span class="COUNTRY">India</span>, and they had to stop off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> to refuel.</sentence><sentence id="2309">So, showing my orders, I got orders to fly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> and then I would find a way of going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2310">Nobody told me how I would do it.</sentence><sentence id="2311">I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> a British officer looking at my orders said, you are very lucky Sergeant Eaton, we have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> in an hour.</sentence><sentence id="2312">But I didn't want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>, I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2313">So I said, well I can't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> now, I have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="2314">He said, it doesn't say in your orders.</sentence><sentence id="2315">I said, I have to go to

want to do that, so instead, he accepted my request and he issued a voucher for me to go to the best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baghdad</span>, where the British</sentence><sentence id="2320">Interview with Joseph Eaton degdeg August 1, 2010 officers were staying, to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at British expense.</sentence><sentence
