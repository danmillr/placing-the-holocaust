<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Why was it so important?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: It was important because I wanted to be one of them, because I felt so persecuted as a Jew that I felt that - I just wanted - at that time, when I was a kid - don't forget, that that was at the time when I was nine, eight, ten, you know - I wanted to be one of them at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: So, explain how to me persecuted as a Jew?</sentence><sentence id="144">What was it like for you as a Jewish child?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Did you yourself feel uncomfortable with the very Orthodox Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: To a point, because they - they couldn't speak Polish.</sentence><sentence id="153">I mean, they spoke Polish with an accent.</sentence><sentence id="154">They spoke mostly, among themselves, they spoke Yiddish, and being so very religious, they had a certain mannerism that distinguished them for the other people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Was it kind of exciting to be in a much larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="293">Q: No?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1909">A: I think that he was not accepted by the Germans because I think - he didn't have a uniform, he didn't have an SS, most likely because we found out later, whether it's true or not, we met his mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and she was a gypsy.</sentence><sentence id="1910">Whether this was the same Mrs. Altov (ph), but if must have been because I talked personally with her.</sentence><sentence id="1911">When I heard that she was an Altov (ph), I went and I talked to her.</sentence><sentence id="1912">And the way she described him, it must have been her son, and she says she was a gypsy and they were in the circus business.</sentence><sentence id="1913">So, I can't tell you, but he wasn't an SS man.</sentence><sentence id="1914">Everybody was afraid of him.</sentence><sentence id="1915">The Judenrat was afraid of him.</sentence><sentence id="1916">They were hardly talking to him, and I'm telling you, I mean I would freeze.</sentence><sentence id="1917">I put my eyes down, I so was afraid, and I kept my shoulders up because I was afraid that he would shoot me in a minute.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2890">A: I was one of the first ones.</sentence><sentence id="2891">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="2892">Renia says that one of them recovered before I, but I - I don't remember whether Renia or Krysia told me that I was really very sick, that I had a very high temperature and I was talking nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="2893">I was delirious.</sentence><sentence id="2894">But 9 once, when you were sick, like when you had typhus - first of all, when you had this high fever, this very high fever, you burned like anything, and even if you were delirious and you were contagious, you weren't as sick as during the crisis - when the crisis came, when your temperature went right down, you couldn't move, and this was - if you survived the crisis, you lived.</sentence><sentence id="2895">Otherwise - and then you, after a while, you were yourself, but a lot of people didn't survive the crisis, and that was the time that I want to tell you about Sulamite (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2896">Because that was when typhus was so rampant, everybody was sick.</sentence><sentence id="2897">The Germans decided they'd have to kill off the people that are sick.</sentence><sentence id="2898">So, what they did, the decided, the army came in.</sentence><sentence id="2899">It was as they - it wasn't - it wasn't because they needed soldiers to put all the sick ones on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to take them out.</sentence><sentence id="2900">So, what they did, they told the policemen that everybody had to come out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, whether he was sick or healthy, and the Germans were watching them and asked them to run.</sentence><sentence id="2901">Whoever could run - the sick ones with the fever could run - but the ones that were just going through the crisis, they couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="2902">So, those were put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and they called me from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to write down the names of the people that were going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2903">Also, at that time, every policeman was - every policeman was responsible for a group, for a few <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> or one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, I forget how it was, but the policemen were responsible that everyone that was in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> came out.</sentence><sentence id="2904">So, at that time, I remember, my sister-in-law, like my husband's sister's husband was also a policeman, he hid somebody there and covered because they person couldn't walk.</sentence><sentence id="2905">So, later after what happened when they found the sick one there covered, you know, and very sick, they killed the policeman.</sentence><sentence id="2906">Cogord (ph) was killed right on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="2907">Then, as I was writing the names - I had two very good friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, two very intelligent, beautiful, two tall girls - I forgot whether they were twins, but they were always together.</sentence><sentence id="2908">One's name was Sulamite (ph), and the other Mira (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2909">One went through quickly, like she ran through, and this Sulamite (ph) couldn't run, she just - because the reason for it was she was in crisis, and she runned, he sent her to, for me to write her name down.</sentence><sentence id="2910">So, I thought that they will take her to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2911">So, I asked - I didn't know those people because they came especially for that function.</sentence><sentence id="2912">They were Becker's people.</sentence><sentence id="2913">You know, Becker was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the Lagers.</sentence><sentence id="2914">Sicherheit Polizei or whatever you call it - Sicherheit Deist, | think they were called.</sentence><sentence id="2915">So, those people were assigned this function.</sentence><sentence id="2916">So, I said to the guy that was standing near me, "Please leave her.</sentence><sentence id="2917">She's my best friend."</sentence><sentence id="2918">So, he says, "Oh, she is, eh?"</sentence><sentence id="2919">He took out the gun and killed her right in my presence.</sentence><sentence id="2920">So, I remember that - I didn't remember - I don't remember what happened to me because I fainted, but the policemen later told me they got me quickly off my job, put me in the <span class="BUILDING">police barracks</span>, covered me there, and the policeman was writing down the names after later.</sentence><sentence id="2921">So, that was very traumatic to me because I saw it with my own eye.</sentence><sentence id="2922">I mean, it wasn't her fault.</sentence><sentence id="2923">She was sick, and all I did, I felt - I felt guilty because I told him she was my friend, but I thought that if I would tell him that she was friend, that he would spare her life, but he just killed her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2958">Q: So, in some sense, you think you're responsible for that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2960">A: I felt that - I thought that maybe if I would have leaved her or something, but I said, "She's my best friend, please leave her.</sentence><sentence id="2961">Let her go."</sentence><sentence id="2962">So, he killed her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2968">Q: Was that the first time you saw anything quite like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2970">A: No, things happened before when Altov (ph) was killing.</sentence><sentence id="2971">I remember, one day he made one Jew dance, like, I don't know, he - he - and he killed him there, and then I watched from the <span class="DLF">office window</span> when he killed him, they called the Ukrainian to take him away, so the Ukrainian caught him by the legs, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was full of sand or something.</sentence><sentence id="2972">So, he was dragging - not dragging, running with him, wherever they told him to take him, and you know all this sand was - how should I say - covering the face of this Jewish man.</sentence><sentence id="2973">So, I saw a few people that were killed and by Atlov (ph), I mean, you know, nobody looked, but when he came and he always killed a few people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2978">Q: What sort of affect does this have on you?</sentence><sentence id="2979">Do you stop feeling things?</sentence><sentence id="2980">I mean, as you start seeing so much brutality, what...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2984">A: Well, it was traumatic.</sentence><sentence id="2985">It was traumatic, very traumatic, and it made us cry, but we couldn't help it.</sentence><sentence id="2986">I mean, we got so used to it that at night, when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, we sang.</sentence><sentence id="2987">Like, we would always, there were songs - special camp songs.</sentence><sentence id="2988">They were different from the songs that we sang in the past.</sentence><sentence id="2989">Today's your turn and tomorrow's going to be our turn.</sentence><sentence id="2990">So, we never knew whose turn it was going to be.</sentence><sentence id="2991">So, we really didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="2992">We wanted to live - life, the will for life was very strong, but not to a point to, you know, to such - because we knew that today's their turn, and tomorrow's going to be ours.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3002">Q: Tell me something.</sentence><sentence id="3003">I don't know whether you know this, when you fainted, when your friend Sulamite (ph) was killed, and the police grabbed you and put you in the...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3020">A: That's what they told me, because I fainted, but they told me that they grabbed me and they said, "Ah, she's no good," or whatever they said, they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and one of the policemen took over.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3080">Q: And, who would tell you the name of the person?</sentence><sentence id="3081">Because Altov (ph) wouldn't know who he's killing.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3100">A: To write down "deceased", but if I didn't know the people - I mean, I got so used to it because it happened quite often, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="3101">So, if I didn't know the face of that person, it was just a name, it was different than when I had to write that Sulamite (ph) was dead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3104">Q: Help me to understand something, because there are people who, when you're afraid, are you constantly afraid or does the terror go up and down?</sentence><sentence id="3105">Because you have to watch all the time, that's clear.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3140">Q: Were you...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3161">A: No, what happened - no, with Paliszewski I was there, but I will tell you that this goes already after the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="3162">Since you asked for Paliszewski, you know the Polacks killed those Einisemann kids and Wolfowicz's kids, and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stratachowice</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="3163">We came to visit the <span class="BUILDING">Paliszewskis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3164">And that day when they killed the whole families including the Einisemanns, the Wolfowiczs, together with the kids that survived the war, being small kids like seven or nine or eight, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3165">They knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paliszewski</span> and they said - Polish partisans or who knows, Polish anti-Semites - they knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they said to Paliszewski, "I know that Laksuvnas (ph) are here, and we want them."</sentence><sentence id="3166">She wouldn't let them have it - Krysia remembers that she said, "I won't let you have them."</sentence><sentence id="3167">But I remember that she said, "What do you mean?</sentence><sentence id="3168">I wouldn't keep Jewish people here."</sentence><sentence id="3169">I remember that way, that she said that, that when they went away, like, they came to kill us.</sentence><sentence id="3170">I mean, specifically they asked for us.</sentence><sentence id="3171">The next morning, the husband of one of the Paliszewskis took us in a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> thing, covered us with straw and took us to another - to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skarzysko</span>, which was a little bit further away, so that we can go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, that nobody will know that he's helping us.</sentence><sentence id="3172">You asked for the Paliszewski story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3185">Q: I was going to ask you another part of the story because what I heard from Chris was that your mother, the day before the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paliszewski</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3187">A: No, my mother couldn't have come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paliszewski</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3188">No, she couldn't have because she went to - before maybe she went.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3191">Q: No, before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3193">A Oh, yeah, before.</sentence><sentence id="3194">Because she's was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3199">Q: But the day before or two days before or something, she came to give her some things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3201">And Chris said, this is what she heard, that your mother told her that if only my three daughters will survive, I will give my life.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3202">A: Yeah, she said that.</sentence><sentence id="3203">She said that to me.</sentence><sentence id="3204">She said in Jewish, because she never spoke in Jewish to us.</sentence><sentence id="3205">She always Polish, but she in Jewish to me that if you survive, I would like to be the orben (ph), the sacrifice.</sentence><sentence id="3206">That's what - she said it in Polish, but she used this Hebrew word.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3212">Q: She said this to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3214">A: To me.</sentence><sentence id="3215">She says, "I hope that three of - I want to be your orben (ph)," or whatever, like, she said it in Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3218">Q: What did that make you feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3220">A: That means that I want to be victim, so that you can live.</sentence><sentence id="3221">She said that to me, and she could've said it to Paliszewski because she could have - <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paliszewskis</span>" was our point of meeting after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3222">They were very good friend of ours.</sentence><sentence id="3223">So, we always used to tell them everything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3228">Q: That's quite something for your mother to have said to you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3230">A: Yeah, she said it to me.</sentence><sentence id="3231">I remember it all the time, and I never believed - that was a couple of days before, before the - I remember it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3234">Q: So, who should we talk about?</sentence><sentence id="3235">Tobah (ph)?</sentence><sentence id="3236">Adrian's escape?</sentence><sentence id="3237">Which do you want to start with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3242">A: Because everything happened the same time.</sentence><sentence id="3243">So, maybe I'll start with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tobah</span> (ph) because maybe it will be shorter.</sentence><sentence id="3244">I don't know that much about her, but about my husband's escape and the way that he bought the gun and stuff like that, it might be a little longer.</sentence><sentence id="3245">So, Tobah (ph) - one day Becker, who was the Sicherheit Deist, came in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with another German soldiers and they came and asked for Tobah (ph), and they took her out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="3246">We didn't know why.</sentence><sentence id="3247">Then, she came back.</sentence><sentence id="3248">We didn't know why.</sentence><sentence id="3249">Then, a few days later, he came for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tobah</span> (ph) again.</sentence><sentence id="3250">Took her himself already.</sentence><sentence id="3251">He took her out again.</sentence><sentence id="3252">He was very polite.</sentence><sentence id="3253">I remember because I was near the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, like they brought her to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and you know, I could look through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and see.</sentence><sentence id="3254">He opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> for her, like if she was - like a girl, and he took her out and he brought her back the same day.</sentence><sentence id="3255">The third time, he took her out - I don't know if it was a few days or a week or two later - he took her out and he never brought her back.</sentence><sentence id="3256">Now, that day, he was ordered - her father was ordered to, to dig a <span class="DLF">grave</span>, and of course, it was like, they called him to work.</sentence><sentence id="3257">He didn't know it was going to be for him.</sentence><sentence id="3258">So, he started digging but he was an older man.</sentence><sentence id="3259">It took him a little time.</sentence><sentence id="3260">So, Schrodt came out of his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, and he 5 took the gun and killed him on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="3261">The <span class="DLF">grave</span> wasn't dug exactly - like, the <span class="DLF">grave</span> was half-finished and he called other workers to cover him.</sentence><sentence id="3262">And she never came back.</sentence><sentence id="3263">Then we found out, because they were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Opatow</span> - it was about, I would say, about 40 kilometers away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3264">Apparently, they had money - money or some goods or some jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="3265">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3266">She must have showed it to them, and after they got whatever they wanted, you know, the money, they just killed her.</sentence><sentence id="3267">I didn't know what happened to her because they didn't bring her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but I was talking to the professor about her because he had - he had her - heard the story and his records.</sentence><sentence id="3268">He told me that he asked, whether he asked himself or whether one of those people that he - that he was talking to told him that she was - the <span class="DLF">grave</span> was found later in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> very close to where she lived - where they lived, where they found the treasures.</sentence><sentence id="3269">So, this was Tobjah Weisblum (ph) that's how she perished, and her father, for money.</sentence><sentence id="3270">Not only because they were Jews, but because they had money.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3300">Q: Why did they kill the father, do you think, at the moment?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3302">A: Because I suppose they decided they didn't want to have any witnesses because nobody knew why Tobjah Weisblum (ph) was taken out, nobody knew, and she never told anybody.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3304">Q: But the father knew?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3306">A: The father probably didn't knew.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3308">Q: Didn't know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3310">A: Didn't know what for they are taking her out.</sentence><sentence id="3311">Because he was - when he was digging the <span class="DLF">grave</span>, it was an older man as I say, he never suspected that that was for him, but Schrodt killed him even before he finished.</sentence><sentence id="3312">Like, he just killed him in front, like during the daytime, when everybody looked on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3316">Q: Did you see that killing?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3444">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3445">So, what happened - the conditions were worse and worse and, you know, when things were happening, a group of people decided that we have to make an uprising and to liberate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3446">It was an idea that we didn't know how to achieve it, but we knew one thing: that we have to get arms, some kinds of guns and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="3447">And this was very secretive.</sentence><sentence id="3448">All the policemen knew about it, because they were young and strong 8 people, and some people, but you know, some people that belonged to the group or was told about it, but not everybody knew about the preparations or the intentions because we were afraid that we could be denounced and killed.</sentence><sentence id="3449">So, anyway, we decided - everything was secret - and we decided that Adrian was the best one to acquire - he volunteered because he was very good at schmoozing and talking people into it.</sentence><sentence id="3450">So, we decided he's going to buy guns.</sentence><sentence id="3451">We would collect whatever we can from the Ukrainians because when they were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they had to give their guns away and they went to get the guns when they came back to work.</sentence><sentence id="3452">They didn't keep the guns with them.</sentence><sentence id="3453">So, when they - that they were supposed to steal - the first gun was purchased, and my husband had it.</sentence><sentence id="3454">He was the one to purchase this gun.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3474">A: From a Ukrainian, a guard, bought it.</sentence><sentence id="3475">They paid for it through the nose with the collected, whatever we could collect.</sentence><sentence id="3476">And he talked to one Ukrainian, and this Ukrainian agreed that he would be selling guns for such and such a price.</sentence><sentence id="3477">I don't remember what it was, whether it was in gold or whether it was in money or whether it was in other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3478">When I say other things, some people were, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span>, like if we left a lot of things - valuables - not only gold and silver, but other valuables like blankets and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and all this.</sentence><sentence id="3479">So, you know, we could tell the Ukrainian go to such and such, and we have the, let's say, two watches or something.</sentence><sentence id="3480">Take the two watches and bring me a gun.</sentence><sentence id="3481">I don't remember exactly how he got the first gun because that's as far as he got, the first gun.</sentence><sentence id="3482">On the second try, they caught the Ukrainian, when he was stealing.</sentence><sentence id="3483">Instead of taking one gun with him or whatever, they caught him stealing - they found two guns in his possession when he - whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3484">So, of course, they investigated and they interrogated him and he said, "He doesn't know the name, but there is one of the policemen."</sentence><sentence id="3485">So, they lined up the policemen, all twelve of them, and the Ukrainian came in and of course he sold it to Adrian, so he went there and he showed, "This is the policeman that bought from me the gun."</sentence><sentence id="3486">Right away, Becker came in and he started interrogating my husband, and my husband said, Adrian, he says, "I never bought from him a gun.</sentence><sentence id="3487">I don't know him.</sentence><sentence id="3488">I didn't - I never saw him."</sentence><sentence id="3489">But, of course, they didn't believe him.</sentence><sentence id="3490">He was interrogated and we had such a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, a small <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> that was made out of concrete.</sentence><sentence id="3491">They put him there for a while, and then Judenrat went to Becker, and Becker came in and he said that he is lying, that Adrian is lying, because the Ukrainian didn't have any problems finding him, and he's going to be condemned to death.</sentence><sentence id="3492">So, the Judenrat decided that - Becker you can buy him.</sentence><sentence id="3493">This is the guy who took out , So, he says, "Okay, if you give me..." No, the Jew said, the Judenrat said to him, "How do you know?</sentence><sentence id="3494">Maybe he's lying.</sentence><sentence id="3495">Why not put him somewhere like lock him up until we find out, until the investigation is through.</sentence><sentence id="3496">If this is true what happened, then he should be killed, but how you can take an innocent man?</sentence><sentence id="3497">I mean the Ukrainian, maybe he had another reason why 9 he showed that this is the guy that bought from him the gun."</sentence><sentence id="3498">So, they agreed.</sentence><sentence id="3499">They put him in this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, and he had to dig his own <span class="DLF">grave</span>, and Becker, not Becker, the other, the Baumgarten read, he read, you know, he read to him the order, that because he bought the gun from the Ukrainian and because he is key of an uprising, he's condemned to death.</sentence><sentence id="3500">He said it in the name of Adolf Hitler, and whatever it is, and so he read this to him, and this was the first time that a <span class="DLF">grave</span> was dug up and they had no body, because they kept him there and then when he got his money, they wanted a kilo of gold.</sentence><sentence id="3501">A kilo of gold, but we didn't have gold, so everybody, if they hid some ring or whatever, even teeth they were putting in their head, and what happened, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Becker</span> and this <span class="BUILDING">Baumgarten</span> to say, "Now, you can start the investigation."</sentence><sentence id="3502">So, in order for him not to be able to escape, they took him out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, took two Ukrainians, they covered his head - like, they put him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>, took off his clothes, put a sack, you know, like a sack hat you put potatoes in or sugar or whatever with holes in it?</sentence><sentence id="3503">They put it over the head.</sentence><sentence id="3504">They took two rubber sticks or whatever and they had such whips - whatever you call it - and they told him that he would get now a hundred whips and he has to count.</sentence><sentence id="3505">So, you know, one, two, three... Adrian said after the twentieth whip, his body was numb.</sentence><sentence id="3506">He says he couldn't even feel anything.</sentence><sentence id="3507">He didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="3508">So, anyway, after they did that, they put him back into the <span class="BUILDING">police barrack</span> there, because they figured that after his body was black and blue and red and bloody.</sentence><sentence id="3509">But he was a very strong boy, and don't forget that in 1943 he was nineteen.</sentence><sentence id="3510">So, I mean, he was a young, strong boy.</sentence><sentence id="3511">They put him in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and they said, "This is only so that he can't escape or can't do anything."</sentence><sentence id="3512">So, they took him from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because he couldn't breathe there, and they put him in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, and the next day they called in appel.</sentence><sentence id="3513">Everybody had to go to the - everybody had to an appel so that they could tell them that what happens if - everybody will be shot who will take part, that if things like this, if people want to escape, if anybody escapes they will kill ten people for each one that escapes, and in addition, they are not going to - because somebody - they didn't say it anymore that Adrian bought the gun - somebody bought the gun for a certain purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3514">They didn't know about the gun that already existed.</sentence><sentence id="3515">They were talking about the gun that they caught the Ukrainian with, you know?There must be a reason why they wanted the gun, and while they were doing it, the guys that were thinking of escaping, of the uprising, they decided that when they visited Adrian later, when he was so sick, that they had to escape at the first opportunity.</sentence><sentence id="3516">So, when everybody was standing at the appel and they were saying that, the policemen were moving because they were always helping to round up people.</sentence><sentence id="3517">So, they went to Adrian's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3518">They took him out.</sentence><sentence id="3519">They had some shears, and they decided, because the Ukrainians were also watching us <span class="NPIP">inside</span> - not <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, the only Ukrainian that was okay was kept, was on the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3520">But they decided to cut - there was ten of them, ten young people.</sentence><sentence id="3521">I don't know how many policemen, but I think about two or three policemen.</sentence><sentence id="3522">The rest were young boys that were always in contact to do the uprising.</sentence><sentence id="3523">So, while they were talking and we were watched by the Ukrainians and the policemen moving around, they cut the barbed wire and my husband, like Adrian was at the time, you can imagine, after he got those lashes the night before or the day before.</sentence><sentence id="3524">They jumped over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and started running.</sentence><sentence id="3525">They had to run quickly over the <span class="DLF">road</span> because on the other side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and the Germans usually, like, all they wanted is to get to the 0 <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> as fast as they could.</sentence><sentence id="3526">But meanwhile Schrodt, the guy that was watching, he started shooting.</sentence><sentence id="3527">So, immediately they took all the Ukrainians and Schrodt was in charge.</sentence><sentence id="3528">He had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> and he started running after them.</sentence><sentence id="3529">But until they found they were a little bit further.</sentence><sentence id="3530">So, anyway they managed to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the Ukrainians and Schrodt came back and Schrodt said to Vaschek (ph), like they said, "I am telling you, the young Wilczek (ph) ."</sentence><sentence id="3531">which in German means the younger Wilczek (ph) I killed personally.</sentence><sentence id="3532">So, we all thought that he's dead, like his mother and his sister assumed that he's completely dead.</sentence><sentence id="3533">Meanwhile, the ten of them managed to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and what are they going to do?</sentence><sentence id="3534">I mean, they run away the way they were.</sentence><sentence id="3535">Nothing - they had nothing on them.</sentence><sentence id="3536">They had no guns, no knives, I mean, I don't know why Adrian didn't take his gun.</sentence><sentence id="3537">I never asked him that question, but when they reached the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, they were very happy.</sentence><sentence id="3538">And we had three kinds of partisans in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3539">One - "1l name them by the Polish name, and then I'll try to translate.</sentence><sentence id="3540">One was Armia Rudowa (ph), which means the People's Army.</sentence><sentence id="3541">This was run by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="3542">It was a Communist party under Russian supervision, and they were taking everybody, like not everybody.</sentence><sentence id="3543">They were accepting people that when they needed them.</sentence><sentence id="3544">The second group was called Armia Kryowa (ph), which means the home army.</sentence><sentence id="3545">Those were Polacks, those were Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="3546">They wouldn't accept Jews, but they would accept Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="3547">They didn't kill the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3548">They hated them, but they didn't kill them.</sentence><sentence id="3549">But then there was an Jnnoset (ph) which was a partisan group that were like Nazi, National Polish Organization that they were killing the Jews like if they met them - the real anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="3550">So, anyway, they were sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="3551">I remember four names - three names - four names.</sentence><sentence id="3552">I remember four names of the escapees.</sentence><sentence id="3553">I don't remember the rest.</sentence><sentence id="3554">So, it was Adrian.</sentence><sentence id="3555">It was a guy Salik Anulevicz (ph), he was the real first cousin of Daniel Levicz (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3556">And, the third one was Freumik Singer (ph), he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Opatow</span> - he was related to Tobjah Weisblum (ph), and the fourth one was James Levy (ph), he was also a policeman, and there were six others, but I really don't remember their names now.</sentence><sentence id="3557">So, as they were waiting in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, the Russian group came by.</sentence><sentence id="3558">So, they told them that they are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> escapees and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3559">So the guys said, "I can't take ten.</sentence><sentence id="3560">We can't take ten.</sentence><sentence id="3561">We don't have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for ten.</sentence><sentence id="3562">We don't have arms for ten."</sentence><sentence id="3563">Because the supplies came directly from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3564">So, they couldn't take so many.</sentence><sentence id="3565">So, he says, "We can only take two of you."</sentence><sentence id="3566">So, he picked up this Freumik (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Opatow</span> and they picked Adrian.</sentence><sentence id="3567">And, he says, "And you stay here, maybe the next group will take you because we don't have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>."</sentence><sentence id="3568">There was apparently 25 of them in this group, this Russian group.</sentence><sentence id="3569">So, there were 27 of them.</sentence><sentence id="3570">Then - so, I will now speak about them, and I'1l come back later to those.</sentence><sentence id="3571">I'Il say what happened to them later.</sentence><sentence id="3572">So, anyway they started to - they needed miner.</sentence><sentence id="3573">What I mean miners - the ones who will put <span class="DLF">mines</span> under <span class="DLF">bridges</span> so that the German arms couldn't put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> like - what they had to do, they had to put <span class="DLF">mines</span> under the <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, but the <span class="DLF">mines</span> were not like today's sophisticated.</sentence><sentence id="3574">They had their <span class="DLF">mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3575">They had the string.</sentence><sentence id="3576">They had to first go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, don't forget the Germans were watching.</sentence><sentence id="3577">They were over every <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, there were German soldiers walking back and forth because that's what they were afraid of, that the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> would be mined.</sentence><sentence id="3578">So, they had to swim or go by such a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that couldn't hear anything under the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, put the <span class="DLF">mine</span> there, go far enough with the string, wait until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> comes - goes by, and pull it.</sentence><sentence id="3579">It was a very dangerous job, and very 1 specialized because when the Germans were up there, if they heard anybody in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, they were shooting them right away.</sentence><sentence id="3580">So, that was a very - the two Jewish boys that were accepted, Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were doing those jobs, and now, they had different encounters with the Germans looking for them, but the Germans were always afraid to go straight to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3581">They had people that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish villages</span> that were telling them about the movement of the Germans and where they were going, and whether they were coming, what happened here and there.</sentence><sentence id="3582">So, they had contact with the world.</sentence><sentence id="3583">They had enough to eat there.</sentence><sentence id="3584">I mean, not that they were given special - like Adrian says, they would bring them a glop of pork, you know, the fat, and they would just eat half a pound to a pound of it, no bread or anything because it depends on what they had and brought in, and he says, "You wouldn't believe what I could eat - this pure fat."</sentence><sentence id="3585">And, they could really eat the pound of fat without anything.</sentence><sentence id="3586">So, they weren't really hungry.</sentence><sentence id="3587">They slept in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and they were doing the mine work.</sentence><sentence id="3588">That was their work.</sentence></p></dialogue>

But they couldn't kill him.</sentence><sentence id="3730">So, they gave him, like, they gave him a gun.</sentence><sentence id="3731">They covered him up.</sentence><sentence id="3732">They gave him all the food they had, and they left him there.</sentence><sentence id="3733">They kissed him and they said, "We are very sorry," because they left him there to die because he was so sick.</sentence><sentence id="3734">So some people were going by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they found him and they took him - some Polacks, most of them were collaborating with the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="3735">They were the people that were saying where the Germans are.</sentence><sentence id="3736">So, they took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they, and it took him ten days and he was better.</sentence><sentence id="3737">So, he decided to go back to his group.</sentence><sentence id="3738">When he went to his - before he went out, he contacted one of those people that they were in contact with, and he said, "T'm sorry to tell you that somebody denounced the group, the Russian group.</sentence><sentence id="3739">The 2 Germans came in while they were asleep in there, and...and one of the - where they kept horses or cows or whatever - one of those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, they put it afire and everybody got killed.</sentence><sentence id="3740">So, he felt so bad, but, I mean, he couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="3741">So, he went...he went back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, after he felt better, and he decided he'll wait for another group.</sentence><sentence id="3742">I'll tell you more about the others that were left, the eight that were left, but I have to finish this story first.</sentence><sentence id="3743">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3773">Q: Hania, before we go back to Adrian in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, let's talk just a little bit about him getting a gun and where you think he may left it, if you have any idea, and did he have any experience with guns?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3775">A: He - he was a Jewish boy.</sentence><sentence id="3776">He never had - he wasn't violent.</sentence><sentence id="3777">He never saw a gun in his life.</sentence><sentence id="3778">I don't think if he was given a gun whether he knew what to do with it unless someone will tell him or show him.</sentence><sentence id="3779">I don't know whether the gun was - the gun that he bought and he - from the Ukrainian guard - whether the gun was at all operational, and whether - I couldn't tell you, maybe it was, maybe it was one of the best, but even if he had it, he wouldn't know how to use it unless someone would show it to him.</sentence><sentence id="3780">So...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3787">Q: So, tell me, of these boys who were planning the break-out...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3795">Q: Right, were there other women involved as well?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3797">A: I was involved.</sentence><sentence id="3798">Some women were involved because we're talking about uprising.</sentence><sentence id="3799">So, the women were also involved.</sentence><sentence id="3800">Like, we didn't think it would be so fast.</sentence><sentence id="3801">We thought that it would take us time first of all to arms and to be prepared and to-to-to-to prepare a strata-strategy.</sentence><sentence id="3802">It wasn't - this was just the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="3803">We had no idea what's - what's going to be after, and we had to be very, very careful and secretive because I think like that, if the Germans would have found out, it would've been death to all of us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3811">Q: So, how many of you would there have been, fifteen, twenty people?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3813">A: That's the most - all the policemen were involved in it, because they - they were the strongest and they were the ones that were supposed to know how to do that, and a few other people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3815">Q: And, when would you meet and discuss this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3817">A: One would tell - we didn't meet.</sentence><sentence id="3818">They would - one of the policemen would come to me and tell me what they decided.</sentence><sentence id="3819">One would tell the other one who'd tell - we didn't meet.</sentence><sentence id="3820">There wasn't no meeting.</sentence><sentence id="3821">I mean, how could you make a meeting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3827">Q: No, I thought that might be the case, but one doesn't know how those things happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3831">A: We knew that the policemen were the - the initiators of that.</sentence><sentence id="3832">So, I knew it, and maybe - I don't know if Chris knew it because she was too young to know about it.</sentence><sentence id="3833">Maybe she did.</sentence><sentence id="3834">I couldn't tell you, and there was a few people, so I would say if they would tell me to tell so and so, but not in certain - we didn't have meetings.</sentence><sentence id="3835">We couldn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3841">Q: So was there one person who was the leader who then made the decision?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3843">A: I think that my - that Adrian was the best at it because - because he knew how to talk to people - how to talk to those Ukrainians to get what he wanted.</sentence><sentence id="3844">He was the type of a person that - that he knew how to - to get things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3847">Q: And who had experience with arms in this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3849">A: Nobody, nobody, even the policemen, they didn't carry anything in their hands.</sentence><sentence id="3850">I mean, I'm talking the Jewish policemen.</sentence><sentence id="3851">I mean, they were only assigned a certain job and they were - there was a good job, you know, by comparison, you know, and they didn't have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and - and work at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron stove</span> where it was so hot that they couldn't breathe.</sentence><sentence id="3852">So, they - they were glad that they had this job, but they were - they were all thinking of uprising and getting rid of because we were too long - too long we listened to that - we went like sheep to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3857">Q: So, when you all were thinking about this separately - because clearly you're not supposed to have conversations because it's too dangerous, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3859">A: No, it's too dangerous, and I'll tell you, I couldn't take a part in the running away, anyway, because they told us that if someone runs away, first the family and then ten other people and there were cases where they killed ten people for one.</sentence><sentence id="3860">If one escaped, they would round up ten people and kill them - shot them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3863">Q: So, you were not going to take any chance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3865">A: I wouldn't because I had my father and my two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="3866">You couldn't take Renia with you, but, you know, if I took part in it and knew what was going on, and in case - listen, we didn't - we didn't expect that everybody - everybody would carry a gun.</sentence><sentence id="3867">First we had to get the guns.</sentence><sentence id="3868">I mean, the idea started - came to us, and we tried, but we weren't successful because we just started.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3873">Q: But, was the idea that all fifteen or twenty, as many as...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3875">A: As many as possible.</sentence><sentence id="3876">That's why ten of them - ten of them were from this group.</sentence><sentence id="3877">The ten people were from this group that ran away that night - that day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3883">Q: And the idea was for that group, whatever the fifteen or whoever many of that group could run away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3885">A: Run away, and then - and then come and do something with, you know, like to maybe to get other guns somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="3886">Go to see the partisans and come back and - and - and free all of us, but it was a stupid idea, but nobody - like you - you didn't believe, but you had to believe that something would be done that we are not going to be killed like, you know, like just go voluntarily to just be killed because the way we saw it, we didn't know about - about what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3887">We didn't know that there was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but it was enough that any German can - could come and kill anybody and, I mean, how did we know?</sentence><sentence id="3888">Maybe one day all of them would just, keep shooting until they shoot us all.</sentence><sentence id="3889">So, those ten that ran away, they were from this group, and they had the best opportunity because the guards weren't there - only one guard.</sentence><sentence id="3890">The Germans and everybody, they round us all up to teach us a lesson.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3897">Q: So, now Adrian having gotten better, and his...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3899">A He came - he came to - he come - he's in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, but of course, already half his time - like he was there for a long time with them, because I didn't tell you, that all he did was the <span class="DLF">mines</span> and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="3900">I didn't tell you everything that happened because it wasn't important, but now - now it's already close to - already deg44.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3903">Q: So, he's with them almost a year or six months?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3905">A: Yes, he's been with them for a long time, but that's when he got sick and they left him.</sentence><sentence id="3906">Like, he was working every day that he had another assignment.</sentence><sentence id="3907">Most of them, he was a specialist in mining.</sentence><sentence id="3908">He was - I mean, working so long every day at it, he was a specialist in it.</sentence><sentence id="3909">Because they had to observe the - the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> going up.</sentence><sentence id="3910">Like, when he had this string, he had to go far enough so that nothing would happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="3911">He had to - he - he activated the <span class="DLF">mine</span>, the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> went up in flames or whatever it was, whatever, and he had to run away back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3912">So, each - each of such <span class="DLF">escapade</span> was very, very dangerous, but in his group, nobody - nobody died from that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3921">Q: So, they taught him how to do all this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3923">A: They taught him, and of course, he used his gun very efficiently later.</sentence><sentence id="3924">I mean, after - because they carried guns all the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3927">Q: So, now he's waiting for another group.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3929">A: He's been waiting for another group, then the worst group comes in, and that was already deg44, Don't forget that the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> - in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there or in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> already finished around January of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="3930">So, that was shortly before - before the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3931">Because we were - for us, May was the end of the war, but for him, where he 6 was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the Russians were very close.</sentence><sentence id="3932">So, January was already the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3933">So, anyway, when he came back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, the worst of the groups, Anazed (ph), got him.</sentence><sentence id="3934">So, the - the name of - the name of the captain or whatever, whatever he was, I know one of the leaders of this group was - his name was Orlig (ph), which means - how do you call it now?</sentence><sentence id="3935">The bird that has such a big beak, such a very aristocratic bird.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3943">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tern</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3945">A: No, aristocratic.</sentence><sentence id="3946">I forgot now.</sentence><sentence id="3947">Anyway, it was a bird, like he said - Adrian told him the truth because there was no use to tell him that - that he's Polish or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="3948">So, the guy looked at him and he figured like this - it's almost the end of the war, what they did now, the Germans would go away because they were sometimes even they were more against Russians than the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3949">They were against Germans, too, but if they have to choose, they would kill the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="3950">So, he figured like in his mind was that if he keeps a Jew, he" ll have a token no matter what happens.</sentence><sentence id="3951">He had a son who befriended Adrian very much - was a friend.</sentence><sentence id="3952">So, he told him, "Please don't tell the guys in the group that you are Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="3953">And, he went and he taught him to pray the Catholic prayer, and he made - he was the one that started the prayer and then - but, Adrian was quite honest.</sentence><sentence id="3954">So, he told his son, but the son never told on him.</sentence><sentence id="3955">Adrian didn't realize that he wanted to - that he wanted to - the guy, the captain of the group wanted to save his life by holding a Jew, but he didn't tell anybody else, but he figured when the Russians come, you prove to them that he's a saint because he has a Jew there.</sentence><sentence id="3956">So, anyway, soon after the war finished - and he was working with them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there - and soon the war finished, the Russians started appearing.</sentence><sentence id="3957">And right away, this guy wanted to say that - that he saved a Jew, but Adrian didn't pay attention to it, but the Russian - the worst part was that the Russian, when he saw him, he said, "Tell me your story."</sentence><sentence id="3958">So, Adrian tells him the story, and he says he was in the People's Army.</sentence><sentence id="3959">They were all Russians, mostly Russians and there were two of them - he didn't say Jewish because he says that they escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they were accepted there, and he says, "This is the last group."</sentence><sentence id="3960">He didn't say anything about being Jewish or anything because he didn't know who the Russian is.</sentence><sentence id="3961">So, the Russian says to him in Russian, he says, "You know, this is a very interesting story.</sentence><sentence id="3962">There was 27 of you - 27 of you -25 Russians and two Polacks," and he says, "That's interesting that one Polack got out and all the Russians, you know, all the Russians perished."</sentence><sentence id="3963">So, Adrian said, he says to his guy, "Kill him, like, shoot him - shoot him."</sentence><sentence id="3964">So, he says, "What do you want?</sentence><sentence id="3965">I'm Jewish."</sentence><sentence id="3966">So, the guy says in Jewish to him, "Why didn't you tell me that before?"</sentence><sentence id="3967">So, anyway, he was saved, but now this guy from the Anazed that killed so many Jews on his ways, tried to - since Adrian was already there, like the Russian and him were already such friends, and so, he tried to say that he was also good to the Jews because he saved him, but he wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="3968">So, Adrian says, "I am the first Jew that he saved."</sentence><sentence id="3969">Because he told him, when he accepted him, ""You are the first Jew that I met in my life that I'll save you - that I'm going to save your life."</sentence><sentence id="3970">So, he repeated it.</sentence><sentence id="3971">I mean, he just said it.</sentence><sentence id="3972">I don't know what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="3973">I don't think that anything happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="3974">Adrian was right away made, like, he was a lieutenant right away.</sentence><sentence id="3975">They put all the stars on him, and then when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he worked for the - 7 like, he was - he worked in the army as a lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="3976">Now, I'll go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salik Anulevicz</span> (ph) and the others.</sentence><sentence id="3977">When this - when they took the two of them - the two of them - the two guys Freumik (ph) and Adrian, they were very much concerned what happened to the other guys, but they never found out.</sentence><sentence id="3978">Only after the war, they found out what happened.</sentence><sentence id="3979">Salik started his story.</sentence><sentence id="3980">When they took them and went away, there was eight of them left.</sentence><sentence id="3981">So, Armia Kryowa, which was the home army, which wasn't killing the Jews, but they were - they were doing everything possible to make their life miserable, went by and they see eight people, and the people - they all told them what happened.</sentence><sentence id="3982">They told them, "We run away from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> in..." And not all of them spoke because the - Hassidic Jews that spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they had a very big accent.</sentence><sentence id="3983">You could right away notice that they were not - I mean, you couldn't tell them you are Polish.</sentence><sentence id="3984">They all knew that they were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3985">So, they said, they, so, there was eight of them - they - they were anti- Semitic, but they said, "We are not going to kill you, but what we are going to do..." They told them to undress.</sentence><sentence id="3986">They left them eight people naked, the way they are.</sentence><sentence id="3987">They took their clothes away.</sentence><sentence id="3988">He says, "Now, wait for the Russians to come, for the other army - for the People's Army.</sentence><sentence id="3989">They"!</sentence><sentence id="3990">take you."</sentence><sentence id="3991">But, and they laughed and laughed that they left them alive but completely naked and took away their clothes.</sentence><sentence id="3992">So, they were there and they started thinking, "What are we going to do now?"</sentence><sentence id="3993">I mean, they can't move.</sentence><sentence id="3994">They have nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3995">They have no clothes.</sentence><sentence id="3996">So, they sat and Salik Anulevicz (ph) was the only one that spoke without an accent.</sentence><sentence id="3997">So, they said, "You know what?"</sentence><sentence id="3998">There's a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> - there was a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and the guy was looking after the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3999">So, he says, "There is this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4000">If you can go there and bring us clothes or food or something."</sentence><sentence id="4001">So, he says, "Why me?</sentence><sentence id="4002">Why not you?"</sentence><sentence id="4003">He says, "You can speak Polish."</sentence><sentence id="4004">So - so, he went.</sentence><sentence id="4005">He decided - I mean, he had no alternative.</sentence><sentence id="4006">He went there, and on the way, a woman came out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and he told her the story.</sentence><sentence id="4007">It was a young woman.</sentence><sentence id="4008">It was the daughter of the - this forestman.</sentence><sentence id="4009">So, she took him <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4010">She gave him something to wear and food and the father came in and the father says, "I can't take eight people.</sentence><sentence id="4011">I cannot."
