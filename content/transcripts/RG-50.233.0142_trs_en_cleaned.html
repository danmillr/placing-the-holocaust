eight or ten people in three layers.</sentence><sentence id="801">And when one turned, everybody had to turn.</sentence><sentence id="802">So I was in one of those.</sentence><sentence id="803">And one day I got separated from all the people that was from my <span class="REGION">area</span> because somebody told me one day that this is where the people get numbers and they are being shipped out to work instead of sending them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="804">I saw a <span class="DLF">line</span> one day: I was way across in another <span

to have beautiful <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span> and polish their shoes and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="828">And I was a farm boy, I knew how to work with dirt and make these things and I made a <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span> and I did keeping up with their <span class="DLF">fields</span>, whatever it is in front of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and I

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="865">A: In addition, of course, because when you were working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, they did not give you enough food for you to be able to continue working and continue living.</sentence><sentence id="866">They have it calculated to give you just enough food to keep you alive but to extract from you all the strength so you become weak.</sentence><sentence id="867">And believe me the way they did it there was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> all the way around the <span class="DLF">fences</span>, there was one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="868">They called the people out and you have to get in five ina row.</sentence><sentence id="869">And then they make you run around this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, the center <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="870">When you ran around and then when you got weak and they started hitting you, you had to run faster, faster.</sentence><sentence id="871">The guy that was doing this, where he ran behind everybody, when he saw the people that he overtook, he stopped right there, those people were not strong enough to live anymore, to produce work, they went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="872">Because they had more people, they brought Jews from all over the world in Europe and they wanted the healthy one to make use of their strength.</sentence><sentence id="873">But I was always running fast and I was always able to keep up and that's how I survived.</sentence><sentence id="874">But what happened is when I did all this extra work I got extra soup.</sentence><sentence id="875">And one day this same guy that was asking for volunteers and I always went and I did and he dug a ladle and he gave me the soup and you saw all the rest of the people just dying to get a bite of something and nobody could get nothing.</sentence><sentence id="876">You see them dying, starving.</sentence><sentence id="877">But then he asked for a volunteer to wash the kettle out.</sentence><sentence id="878">And I was very gladly going to wash the kettle because this guy didn't care about how he dipped out.</sentence><sentence id="879">The best stuff was in the bottom of the kettle.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="895">Q: This was another prisoner, this guy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="897">A: No, this was one of the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="898">And when I come there to volunteer to wash the kettle and I was one of the volunteers, I already got a bowl of soup, I heard him say to me, you swine and he hit me on my side with his right hand and he busted my ear drum.</sentence><sentence id="899">And since then I had nothing but pain and even after I got liberated, I went to doctors in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and doctors in everywhere and I finally ended up here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> a place with the <span class="BUILDING">ear clinic</span> where a doctor said to me, I have one choice, have the operation because it's so deteriorated that it's going to affect my brain and it's pressing against my brain and that I don't have much to live.</sentence><sentence id="900">So I authorized him to operate on me and he took the mastoid out completely and I have a mastoid, a plastic one and I don't hear in my left ear.</sentence><sentence id="901">But thank God the operation was very successful.</sentence><sentence id="902">The doctor told me I would have to come in and check-ups and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="903">But thank God whatever it did it took over.</sentence><sentence id="904">I go 15</sentence><sentence id="906">to see him every couple of years or so and I have no problem.</sentence><sentence id="907">So anyway I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
