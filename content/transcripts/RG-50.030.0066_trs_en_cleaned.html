<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: What, what was life like for a teenager at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="77">A: Well, well, we always felt that we are Jews.</sentence><sentence id="78">We were sections in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> I wouldn't go as a Jew, because you were a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="79">I don't know -- discrimination of, it was so much against Jews I assume I didn't really felt it so much because I lived more in the area of Jews and I maybe didn't have so much contact with not-Jews, but the -- you always were aware that you are a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="80">You didn't go in certain <span class="NPIP">sections</span> which was not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="81">You felt that you are a Jew because the laws which were there or the surroundings what not-Jews, how they acted and reacted to your being a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="82">So that was really what was as far as I can remember as a as a as a teenager.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Did you join <span class="BUILDING">clubs</span>?</sentence><sentence id="90">Were you part of a group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: not really.</sentence><sentence id="94">Not really, not really.</sentence><sentence id="95">We were more -- Jews, my friends who are Jewish, mostly, and we not really lived in an <span class="REGION">area</span> where were just Jews living.</sentence><sentence id="96">We were also in an <span class="REGION">area</span> what lived other people, but your contact mostly you had with the Jewish, because you were resented very much from the not-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="97">Very seldom that you had a not-Jewish friend.</sentence><sentence id="98">And my time was that I worked, I worked till, when, we are 20, 20, you had to go to the army.</sentence><sentence id="99">When you are 20 you went to <span class="BUILDING">army</span> for one and a half year.</sentence><sentence id="100">And that was in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="101">And, but my mother died in 1936.</sentence><sentence id="102">She was sick, I don't know exactly what, I think bronchitis or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="103">Anyway she died and I was about 20 and there come the time I had to go in the army and my father remarried after a short time, married, and I resented this.</sentence><sentence id="104">So as it came I had to go to the army and I served in the Polish army, for almost one and a half year.</sentence><sentence id="105">My time expired.</sentence><sentence id="106">You -- after one and a half year would have been on September the 15th, 1939, and the war broke out on Ist, September the Ist, so I ended up being a soldier while the war broke out, so I was in the war as a soldier, Polish army, against the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="107">Now talking about the reaction of non-Jews to the Jews, when I was in the army I went in the war.</sentence><sentence id="108">I was just as afraid from my comrades and from my sergeant as much as, as I was from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="109">I didn't trust them.</sentence><sentence id="110">They mentioned, "You are a Jew," and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="111">So I was really afraid in a time like that can happen anything with you.</sentence><sentence id="112">So, we fought till the 25th, seventh, whatever the two weeks, three weeks; and I ended up, I became a prisoner of war.</sentence><sentence id="113">And the first reaction I had on the front with that soldier, the German soldier what took me said, "Are you a Jew?"</sentence><sentence id="114">I just said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="115">But he didn't react.</sentence><sentence id="116">He could shoot me or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="117">He didn't -- said, "Go, go, go."</sentence><sentence id="118">And they didn't do anything to me.</sentence><sentence id="119">So, but anyway they took us as prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="120">They kept us for two days <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and it was cold already and they sent us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as, as prisoner of war.</sentence><sentence id="121">And as prisoner of war we worked; it was very bad.</sentence><sentence id="122">I got sick and they did hardly fed you.</sentence><sentence id="123">They didn't get hardly any food, and you know any -- may, maybe I need some medication or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="124">I didn't get anything.</sentence><sentence id="125">And most of all was our work.</sentence><sentence id="126">We went cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">It was -- must have been near to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.332518" long="12.370244">Leipzig</span>, I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="128">And there we cleaned the <span class="DLF">street</span> and, and -- till the one day came that all the Jewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Pole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">That was in March of 1940, and they sent us back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, to Pole, because they figured for the Jewish prisoners of war still has some more privileges than a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they wanted to get rid of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="130">That's the reason they send us back.</sentence><sentence id="131">And I came and I thought I go back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where my father lived.</sentence><sentence id="132">When I came there I found out that in "39 already, in December, they already took all the Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="133">There was a big <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>, so all the Jews took out and sent them away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">So I followed them.</sentence><sentence id="135">I didn't know exactly where, but somehow -- I don't remember how I found him.</sentence><sentence id="136">I found him where he is, and I came there and he had a hard time because they took only with them whatever they had on their shoulder and they had on them.</sentence><sentence id="137">They didn't, could take -- you couldn't take anything with them.</sentence><sentence id="138">So that was a hard time.</sentence><sentence id="139">Didn't have anything.</sentence><sentence id="140">So was very, a very hard time.</sentence><sentence id="141">So when I came back and I looked down what's going on, so I figured -- I went, I went to a farmer and asked if 1 can be a help there, as farmer's help.</sentence><sentence id="142">And he agreed to it, and he kept me there as a <span class="DLF">farm</span>'s worker, and I just did farm work.</sentence><sentence id="143">Was a Ukraine family and, he paid me.</sentence><sentence id="144">They gave me food and shelter and I think he paid me by the year with so much bags of corn or whatever, what I could sell and that I could help my family with that.</sentence><sentence id="145">And I was there for one and a half year, and then my brother what was nine years old, younger, was in the age that he could -- he was about 18 or something -- so he could -- 17, 18, that he -- I found for him a job too.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: What was it like on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: Now they were, they were nice people and they took me like a <span class="DLF">farm</span>'s help, and probably I was cheaper than anybody else, but they were nice people.</sentence><sentence id="202">They were pretty good to me.</sentence><sentence id="203">They were not really to mistreat me or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="204">And, I had to do all the work.</sentence><sentence id="205">They were very nice people.</sentence><sentence id="206">I cannot, say they mistreated me; but my father lived in a place not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I work on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">It was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span>, not far from the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, about five miles away, things like that.</sentence><sentence id="208">So sometimes when I had a day off I could go back there and I walked.</sentence><sentence id="209">A matter of fact back then there was not any transportation there, and there was very hard for the people, for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="210">Very hard.</sentence><sentence id="211">Very restricted, curfew.</sentence><sentence id="212">They couldn't do things much, but the mostly what they lived is they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, brought some merchandise and sold it and that's the way they could live, "cause it was not that -- they probably they didn't much trade and there was not any industry whatever.</sentence><sentence id="213">So they had really a hard time and, and the Germans mistreated the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="214">If he saw one on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he didn't like him, he could shoot him like that and they buried him in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he stood where he shot him.</sentence><sentence id="215">So we had <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you have to watch just not to go on these <span class="NPIP">places</span> because there's somebody buried there, so this really was a sad time.</sentence><sentence id="216">It was also very dangerous to go from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to the place where I, where my father lived because if a German saw you on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and he didn't like you for whatever reason, he shot you and no, was no recourse.</sentence><sentence id="217">He couldn't tell anybody, nobody will listen.</sentence><sentence id="218">He was king, as far as a Jew concerned.</sentence><sentence id="219">He didn't need any laws to ever, to adhere to it.</sentence><sentence id="220">He just, just did whatever he liked, he felt like.</sentence><sentence id="221">So that was really -- you got used to live with it.</sentence><sentence id="222">You took it already for normal the way it is.</sentence><sentence id="223">You just watched out that you are not around what get shot or whatever, so we worked there and the restrictions for the Jews became every time more restrictions and more restrictions till, one day the only things what Jews could do is working at a <span class="DLF">farm</span> as a farmer's help.</sentence><sentence id="224">So we were still safe for a little time because in meantime they sent all these Jews, sent away to all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">And in June of 1942 when they, they sent a transport of Jews away from the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and my father was in this group with the second wife, with my step-mother.</sentence><sentence id="226">They were in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">Later when being in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> I found out that this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibdr</span> because I met people, younger ones, what went with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and they worked there, so they knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="228">So, to come back to about my story, when I -- so I, as I say we still were able to work at the farmer, till one day all they came the restrictions Jews couldn't work at farmers.</sentence><sentence id="229">Everybody has to concentrate in the next <span class="NPIP">place</span>, nearest <span class="NPIP">place</span>, bigger <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- all the Jews around what work for the farmers, so in other words it was strict, no, no Jews anymore.</sentence><sentence id="230">So we know what's going on, so we didn't go, so my brother and my friend were -- all three we worked at the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">So we decided not to go to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">We thought, "Let's go in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">Maybe we'll find some, some partisans, or something like that."</sentence><sentence id="234">So we went in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> instead to go to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and we walked around in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">We didn't have any food.</sentence><sentence id="236">It was cold and no shelter, nothing, so we had to come, find our way out of it because we didn't find any partisans and you couldn't live that and the people, the Polish people, wouldn't help you.</sentence><sentence id="237">They didn't.</sentence><sentence id="238">First of all we were afraid to show our face and if we did even they were very reluctant have anything to do with you.</sentence><sentence id="239">You were afraid they might go to tell the Germans that you are there.</sentence><sentence id="240">So we heard somehow that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Izbica</span>--was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> about maybe 10, 15 miles away, 20 miles, whatever--that there are still some Jews in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so we walked till we came there.</sentence><sentence id="241">We came there in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="242">And we came, there were still Jews there and we talked with the other Jews what lived still there and surely everybody was helpful to do.</sentence><sentence id="243">We told them where we come from and what -- sure -- they took us in.</sentence><sentence id="244">Every stranger, they took us in, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there was full with Jews, you know, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and everybody just took care of a shelter; and the same night the Germans came at night and drove all the people out of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to collect them in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and to go to send them away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">Now we were still -- there was this old <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, you had this <span class="INT_SPACE">attics</span> and things like that, so we tried to hide there in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> not to come out, but they didn't do any effort to get you out because they figured eventually you will have to come out.</sentence><sentence id="246">No food, no shelter, no facilities, you have to come out, and that is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="247">After three nights hiding and not having food, whoever was hiding came out of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the others went already what they collected, they went already sent them back to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we were the ones what were hiding, so they later they took us to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span>; and, whatever people they collected, they pushed us in, in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span>, as many people as they could squeeze in and we were standing, no moving, nothing and the whole night we traveled in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">Now there was people fell down.</sentence><sentence id="249">People had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and there was, there was a mess -- you cannot imagine.</sentence><sentence id="250">But you had no, any choice, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="251">So that after the morning -- in the morning we ended up arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">That is the way we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">So I was with my brother and myself and my friend; and we all meet the other rest of the people, about seven, 800 people and they took us out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they put us in two <span class="DLF">lines</span> and they start collecting -- picking out people.</sentence><sentence id="254">I didn't know what the picking out means, so one German asked me, "Where are you from?"</sentence><sentence id="255">I said, "From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ledz</span>."</sentence><sentence id="256">"Out."</sentence><sentence id="257">And then they went further. "</sentence><sentence id="258">What are you?" "</sentence><sentence id="259">A carpenter." "</sentence><sentence id="260">Out."</sentence><sentence id="261">Things like that, so they picked about 18 to 20 people.</sentence><sentence id="262">Well, let me maybe say that we hear in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that that happens with the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="263">They kill Jews and they gas Jews and things like that; but we really, as young people, we really didn't believe that something like that is possible.</sentence><sentence id="264">We thought, "Maybe the younger people will take to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">Maybe only the older people...." You just didn't want to be -- wan-- wanted to believe, because it was so incomprehensible, so unbelievable that something like that can happen that you just -- even if you had the intelligence you didn't believe it, so when they picked us out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I really didn't know what means the picking out means, whether life or death.</sentence><sentence id="266">So they took us -- the 20 people -- they took us in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the others went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> -- what we found out later.</sentence><sentence id="267">So we worked in there.</sentence><sentence id="268">Went -- in the afternoon, in the afternoon, they took us with all the other people to separate the clothes.</sentence><sentence id="269">That started to be our work and I started to separate my clothes -- that was the clothes from people who just arrived with the transport what we came with, and while I did that I found the clothes of my brother, the pictures from the family, so I knew already -- they already told me what's going on, so I knew already what happened, that he went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> with my friend and I am here separating his clothes.</sentence><sentence id="270">So you can imagine what went through my mind when that happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: What did you do?</sentence><sentence id="342">How did you handle that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="345">A: Well, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="346">I, I -- everything stopped on me, like I stopped functioning.</sentence><sentence id="347">I just -- also I heard all the stories before that didn't penetrate in me, I didn't accepted it, but that made it already accepting.</sentence><sentence id="348">That is the truth.</sentence><sentence id="349">That's what happened, because I saw what happened.</sentence><sentence id="350">So it's hard to tell the feelings.</sentence><sentence id="351">It's -- it is just -- you stop thinking.</sentence><sentence id="352">You stop functioning.</sentence><sentence id="353">It is just like somebody hits you with a hammer in your head, something like that, so -- but you had to do your work.</sentence><sentence id="354">You were not your own.</sentence><sentence id="355">You had to function just to function, to move, to go, to do things like that, so we finished our work and surely constantly in my mind what happened and, and, and that was really our work, what we do, day in, day out and, and then we went back and then after the work they always kept us around five o'clock, before it gets dark, back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, where we, we slept.</sentence><sentence id="356">Selma told the work about it was divided.</sentence><sentence id="357">It was a section where the Germans lived, and that was really fixed up nicely with <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="358">And then was <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where we lived, mostly where, we slept in other words.</sentence><sentence id="359">And there was a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="DLF">park</span> or call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or whatever -- there were also places where they had a shoemaker, a goldsmith, a tailor, a regular smith, things like that, but that was mostly not for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="360">That was mostly work done for the Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="361">What they need some work, they did it; like the goldsmith that did for them good different things, made for them up rings.</sentence><sentence id="362">You see, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> really was -- that was one of many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, of about four or five <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> what was really a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">It was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="364">The distinction is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>, people came there, they were directed to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">They -- the small group what worked, like us, was just to keep the things going; in other words separating the clothes, cleaning out.... Before we came, before I came, about a few months before, they start, it was different.</sentence><sentence id="366">When a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came, they picked out about 50, 60 people from this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and when all the people were already in, gone to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, they cleaned up after them and then these people were shot in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, often in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">later they found out it's more efficient for them to have the same people do always the same work, so they start to have permanent people doing the cleaning up, the separating all the kind of thing, and that what started to be a permanent group in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> what worked there.</sentence><sentence id="368">And we were the ones what, what did this kind of work.</sentence><sentence id="369">So it was, as I have to explain maybe, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was so as I say we lived apart where the Germans lived.</sentence><sentence id="370">We lived, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we worked and there was Lager Three, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span>, where the people went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and there, there were in the beginning was as burying and later.... Is that the right word?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="397">Q: Buried.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: Buried them.</sentence><sentence id="400">And later, they came they burned.</sentence><sentence id="401">They had a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roaster</span> thing that they burned the people.</sentence><sentence id="402">Now, also, we had hard times.</sentence><sentence id="403">Everyday, almost, they beat you, they, they mistreated you.</sentence><sentence id="404">They made you working, day and night and all the kind of thing, but you were young and you could take it as much as you could take it.</sentence><sentence id="405">Whoever couldn't take it was taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they fell, just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was a change of people.</sentence><sentence id="406">Very often a lot of people were changed because they just couldn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="407">They couldn't, physically they couldn't have it.</sentence><sentence id="408">Now the people what work in Lager Three was often a change of it, because the people worked directly with the bodies and having to work on that, it -- most people, mentally, they just couldn't have it; and they were changed.</sentence><sentence id="409">They had to change the group.</sentence><sentence id="410">They killed, they killed them and they picked out another group of people and they took them, or they took some of ours or things like that.</sentence><sentence id="411">They took; and if you once came there, you never came out of it because that was the real end, the real end.</sentence><sentence id="412">Nobody could come out from that.</sentence><sentence id="413">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself the food what they gave you really was -- we called it a straw soup.</sentence><sentence id="414">That was something you couldn't even swallow.</sentence><sentence id="415">You had to spit out and in the morning, black water and a slice of bread for the 24 hours.</sentence><sentence id="416">Now if you had to live on that, you couldn't really live there; but because we work with this, clothes, separating the clothes and the people came -- they always brought with them -- you saw -- they couldn't take much with them, the people what got sent on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">They just took them from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and say, "Go," so they took with them -- usually what you take, you take with you the valuables what you can in small things like diamonds, rings and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="418">They figure, "They'll let me take something.</sentence><sentence id="419">You never know what happen."</sentence><sentence id="420">And also some food.</sentence><sentence id="421">They took cans of food, things like that, so we were the ones what really worked with that, so knowing that we don't have much to, to eat, so we took the risk to steal this food and we brought it back and we ate it.</sentence><sentence id="422">Now if they caught you, you were shot on the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="423">You had a piece, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">can</span>, or whatever, they shot you.</sentence><sentence id="424">They didn't even question, ask you nothing.</sentence><sentence id="425">Just shot you.</sentence><sentence id="426">Now lot of times they did it, they caught somebody, they took us out to show what happens if somebody steals, but we still kept doing it, regardless; and so we really had -- sometimes we had food to eat.</sentence><sentence id="427">So even the time when we didn't have the food one evened out with the other, so we were not -- as far as that's concerned, not they fed us but we fed ourself.</sentence><sentence id="428">We took the food, we stole the food and so we had sometimes from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, we had the food.</sentence><sentence id="429">And also, as for clothes, what I mentioned -- people ask you, "In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you look not so bad dressed," and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="430">Now we work with these clothes, so if, if we had a ripped jacket and we saw another one, we took another jacket and we didn't have special camp clothes.</sentence><sentence id="431">We had our regular clothes what we came in, so there as far as that, but there was always the -- if you didn't look right or the German maybe had just a drink and he didn't like your look, he took you out and shot you.</sentence><sentence id="432">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="433">He didn't have to give any account to anybody what he is doing.</sentence><sentence id="434">He just did whatever he felt like.</sentence><sentence id="435">Now we had some what we had to be very careful, because they always were suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="436">And if they had any suspicion, justified or not justified, you could be a target of it.</sentence><sentence id="437">What they did, sometimes they took us out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and they, they took us and shot people and things like that, you didn't look right, you didn't walk right.</sentence><sentence id="438">And also when they took us out on Appell!</sentence><sentence id="439">and you didn't stay right, he decided, gives you 25 whips -- they had whips -- 25 whips on the, on the on, on, on your bare, bare bottom.</sentence><sentence id="440">So, I had it a few times.</sentence><sentence id="441">I got beaten, so, so I took when I was on my work I saw some other pants, so I took two pair of pants.</sentence><sentence id="442">I figured if they beat me it wouldn't be so bad.</sentence><sentence id="443">So they found out that, so I got beaten and I had to take off both my pants.</sentence><sentence id="444">And so you got beaten on 25 whips and if you, you had to count it.</sentence><sentence id="445">If you didn't -- stopped counting in the middle, you had to start from the beginning and he gave you another 25.</sentence><sentence id="446">So that was really one of the minor things.</sentence><sentence id="447">The main thing was we always were living with that people seeing what we -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that came and they went to these <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> -- men, women, children, and that was always a heart-breaking thing to see and, and that was really... Ours is beating alright, the next day you were better, but that is not so important.</sentence><sentence id="448">But that what we saw what happens, and that what really always touched us.</sentence><sentence id="449">But, but it is strange that even, even, if you were young and even if you see what happen and you know it's no way out of here, even if you think, "It's just a fantasy," that you think, "I will come out of here all right."</sentence><sentence id="450">It just -- you hope, your hope is justified hope -- not justified hope, but you think because your will for life is so -- you think, "Ah, one day I will come out of it."</sentence><sentence id="451">There was really not any reason to believe it will happen, because it was, it was around with <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span>, <span class="DLF">mines</span> around, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, guards around, dogs around, and even if you get out you wouldn't know where to go even.</sentence><sentence id="452">So there was not really any, any real hope whatever, not any spark of hope there that you would can come out ever.</sentence><sentence id="453">But still, you know, "roll call (German).</sentence><sentence id="454">as I say, you're young.</sentence><sentence id="455">You think -- a matter of fact sometimes being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you're not fully alert, you were not -- you couldn't believe that what happened happens here because it was so far from reality really, thinking that -- how can you imagine -- they burn people -- they, they kill people, young people, children.</sentence><sentence id="456">You couldn't believe that.</sentence><sentence id="457">So if you're not really fully aware you thought that is not true, you just dream.</sentence><sentence id="458">But really that was, was what happened.</sentence><sentence id="459">So, in general to say that really what, what was the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="460">So there are different, cases that happened that people -- it is in the movie, is it about -- there was a group what worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, about 10 people, 15 people, whatever; and they went out with two Ukrainians to work there.</sentence><sentence id="461">Now and there was in this group -- one day, they and were in this, in this Ukraines, the guards -- and they killed one and, and they start to run away, so a few got away and the rest were caught and brought back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">And when that happened, they -- we had to go on Appell and they took us to show how they shot all these people and we had to see it as a lesson when you ran away.</sentence><sentence id="463">That was one accident.</sentence><sentence id="464">There was another one, a similar story happened something -- somebody ran away so this time they took different.</sentence><sentence id="465">They took each 10th -- they put us on an Appell and every 10th of the <span class="DLF">line</span> they picked out; and every 10th, the group what they collected from that they took them with them and they shot them together with the other ones.</sentence><sentence id="466">Now I happened to be number nine in a <span class="DLF">line</span> where they picked the 10th of it, so luck was with me somehow I guess.</sentence><sentence id="467">So they, they shot this group; so things like that happened very, very often.</sentence><sentence id="468">I really couldn't recall how many times -- probably Selma told about this -- 72 Dutch people, there was a rumor that they want to ran away so they took the whole 72 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> and they shot them all.</sentence><sentence id="469">Things like that happened very often.</sentence><sentence id="470">Somebody -- I told you about the -- we were on this trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I testified that Frenzel", one of the Germans, he shot a dentist for no reason.</sentence><sentence id="471">We had to see how he put him down and turned around and shot him in his back, in the neck here and he fell down, and I testified for that.</sentence><sentence id="472">Now that's one of the few cases that I remember things that they did, things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="548">Q: Can you tell us a little more about Frenzel and the kinds of things he did?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="550">A: Well, the -- each German was really an, an individual by himself.</sentence><sentence id="551">Although they all had -- they came for one purpose, just to treat the Jews there, but each one had reacted to his character.</sentence><sentence id="552">As I mentioned once, there was one what was there for some whatever reason, but he was not the worst one.</sentence><sentence id="553">He could give a Jew another piece of bread; but the other one like Frenzel, he looked for trouble not for him, for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="554">He didn't like somebody, he shot them.</sentence><sentence id="555">He would -- people ?</sentence><sentence id="556">Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel would -- sometimes you couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="557">They were in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for a day.</sentence><sentence id="558">He didn't like you are so long there for a day.</sentence><sentence id="559">He took them out and took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span> and they shot all of them, so each individual really was what he was by himself.</sentence><sentence id="560">It was not a command they had to do that.</sentence><sentence id="561">Like we had another one, Wagner", what was -- that was the worst one of all of them.</sentence><sentence id="562">The worst thing about him is he was very sharp and very suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="563">If he has his eye and his intuition and his feeling for so he could smell out something there will be trouble tomorrow, so we were always careful.</sentence><sentence id="564">When he was around - - we had a name for him, "VaYikru".</sentence><sentence id="565">Now that means -- we called him "VaYikru," because we didn't want any name, popular name, that you don't recognize it, so we knew when we said -- when he came near to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we said "VaYikru," so everybody knew to be alert and out of his way because it always happened with him something.</sentence><sentence id="566">He always took somebody.</sentence><sentence id="567">He killed him or he beat him or whatever, so we always were very careful as far as that.</sentence><sentence id="568">So what I want to point out, the claim that these guards say they had to do the things, are definitely not true.</sentence><sentence id="569">First of all, a lot of time they asked for volunteers because they didn't want to work they went there, but they were not commanded to particularly shoot this one or do this one.</sentence><sentence id="570">Their function was to go there and to see that if work functions, that the people go, come from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and do the things, but each individual showed his character there and when he was one what he wanted to hurt personally something, he did it there; and he didn't have to give any, any account of it, what he is doing.</sentence><sentence id="571">So the Frenzel was really one of the bad ones.</sentence><sentence id="572">He, he really -- if he could kill people, he did.we had one, for example, what worked in Lager Three and he used to be a boxer, Gomerski", and for him they made a special whip what was heavier and one day he came back from Lager Three and we were on Appell and he came -- this Frenzel was with us -- and he was bragging to Frenzel -- we understood, we speak German -- so he says to him that he just killed a Jew with 12 hits with his whip.</sentence><sentence id="573">So, so they chose that each character lived out his character there.</sentence><sentence id="574">It was not that he had to do that; they did it, so the excuse that they had to that is nonsense.</sentence><sentence id="575">So, there's -- well, also my work was separating clothes when transport came at night.</sentence><sentence id="576">Sometimes they took people out any <span class="NPIP">time</span>, anybody to do different kind of works.</sentence><sentence id="577">What they did, they cut the hair of the women.</sentence><sentence id="578">The women went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> after the men and then they stopped, about one or two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> before the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where they left their luggage and they had to undress; and there was a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> the next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> where they cut at randomly, they cut the hair of the women.</sentence><sentence id="579">They utilized it.</sentence><sentence id="580">They send it back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>; they did for brushes, for everything.</sentence><sentence id="581">So we were sometimes picked out at night to cut the hair, and it happens once I happened to be one of this group.</sentence><sentence id="582">I had to go also to cut the hair.</sentence><sentence id="583">Now we were about 10 feet from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="584">There was -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> was here and there was like the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> like I say next to it so and they came.</sentence><sentence id="585">If the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish transports</span> were-- the Polish Jews knew more what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="586">They knew they're going to death and also they were more religious and the women came in &gt; Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner * Oberscharfiihrer Hubert Gomerski 0 and we were young boys, 20, 22, five, and we were standing there.</sentence><sentence id="587">They came naked in, and we had to cut their hair.</sentence><sentence id="588">There was a horrible yelling and screaming for all these, from knowing, from feeling they go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="589">On top of that, they're ashamed to put it in.</sentence><sentence id="590">But with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch transport</span>, was quieter.</sentence><sentence id="591">They didn't know really -- they didn't realize really that they're going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to death, so I have I happened to cut somebody's hair and they started to talk to me.</sentence><sentence id="592">Say, "How, how is it here and what...?"</sentence><sentence id="593">They still didn't believe already, and the Germans around the small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but a little bigger than that.</sentence><sentence id="594">So they around so we couldn't, we couldn't talk to them so I didn't say a word.</sentence><sentence id="595">I couldn't, because they didn't want us we talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="596">They were afraid we tell them or things like that, so we couldn't say anything, but that was a horrible thing to see these women with children and all ages and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="597">I mean know -- we knew where would they go.</sentence><sentence id="598">So as I say hard to, to tell this picture.</sentence><sentence id="599">They cut randomly the hair, something like they chopped up down here and send away those people, so to the lowest point these people were brought down when they went to the.... It's, it's unbelievable how takes it to tell that.</sentence><sentence id="600">Whoever didn't see it cannot describe it how that really looks or feeling it.</sentence><sentence id="601">We were always were sick from it when we came back from that, but as I say that was random.</sentence><sentence id="602">Sometimes they took us to this kind of work.</sentence><sentence id="603">And, we had other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="604">Like for example we had one times we had, on a Sunday was that and they locked us up in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="605">We were not allowed to go out and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> arrived and there came some, some people came in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="606">And there was full with guards and all the guards were in, all the Germans and everything, and they took them further down where they usually people arrive and they go and take their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and we heard a lot of shooting.</sentence><sentence id="607">So much shooting and shooting, we didn't know what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="608">The next day they took us to work to separate the clothes, and we're separating the clothes from these people what were shot.</sentence><sentence id="609">They're full with blood -- terrible, and, and while we are separating the clothes we -- I found in a pocket of one of these of one of these trousers -- I found a little note written in Yiddish and it says, "We come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span>," what was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like that and where the people that did the kind of work that we do; and to liquidate the Belzec, they brought them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="610">And the people knew where they go, so they put a resentment, so they shot them.</sentence><sentence id="611">They just shot them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, so all these people, and they say, and the note says, "We are from there, we know where we go.</sentence><sentence id="612">Take revenge for us."</sentence><sentence id="613">So that was -- we knew the people or so.</sentence><sentence id="614">So our hopes for coming out was really no hopes whatever, no hopes whatever.</sentence><sentence id="615">We knew what the end is.</sentence><sentence id="616">It's just if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> are finished, we are finished and we go and we will be shot, all of us.</sentence><sentence id="617">I don't remember, there's so many de-- so many accidents -- incidents that happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> what so horrible I really don't come to fresh in my mind to tell what it is, but stories like that happened almost every other day.</sentence><sentence id="618">Almost every other day.</sentence><sentence id="619">It was if we lived through a day -- if we made it through the day, if you make it to the evening you know you lived today.</sentence><sentence id="620">Otherwise you didn't know what tomorrow is, because tomorrow morning if 1 he didn't like what you looked like, you could be dead.</sentence><sentence id="621">Constantly like that.</sentence><sentence id="622">So we lived with this.</sentence><sentence id="623">It is hard to say how you live a life like that.</sentence><sentence id="624">You just live with the minute.</sentence><sentence id="625">You don't make plans.</sentence><sentence id="626">You don't think far.</sentence><sentence id="627">You don't -- you concentrate, you just concentrate on the minute, "I want to make the, the first 10 minutes, the next minute, the next minute," and that is the way we really lived because, it's really impossible to explain what it means to live in a situation like that.</sentence><sentence id="628">And nobody -- if somebody tries to say something about -- it's impossible to say.</sentence><sentence id="629">Even the one what lived it through couldn't explain really how that was, to live like that.</sentence><sentence id="630">So -- but -- and there was a group what, was thinking of, of running away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="716">Q: Let's hold it for a minute.</sentence><sentence id="717">Before we get to the uprising, we -- would you tell me, um, how you met your wife?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="720">A: I guess by at <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="721">By at <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="722">Because we worked in with separating the clothes and in the evening we came back to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="723">The men and women lived in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span>, or big -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was circled round with barbed wire and woven with branches from the green -- evergreen trees, and -- but there was many <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was in that.</sentence><sentence id="724">There was a section where the women slept and we slept in another.</sentence><sentence id="725">The <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was there and the <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> were they set, so in the evening when we arrived they gave us to eat something and, and then we have about nine o'clock or eight-thirty depending when it was dark, we had to go and sleep in our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, so the few hours between eating and sleeping so we could see each other, walk around in this half of this, <span class="BUILDING">court</span>, <span class="BUILDING">court</span> round and we could talk with each other; and I, and I met Selma.</sentence><sentence id="726">She probably knows the details better than I do, but anyway we met and we stayed always together.</sentence><sentence id="727">So I think that also was really a -- that makes it also easier, subconsciously, easier for us to endure in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we had each other.</sentence><sentence id="728">We liked each other, and we could, communicate together and we were young, so I think it's a normal reaction to it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="738">Q: How did you see -- keep seeing her, given the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the way it was set up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="740">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="741">Well, we tried to be as much as we can together.</sentence><sentence id="742">In other words when we went on Appell, we tried to be together and, when -- after work we were together.</sentence><sentence id="743">So we worked, we went separating the clothes, if possible, we were together, so we were pretty often and pretty --very -- and very often together as far as the work didn't interfere with -- if the work wasn't the same <span class="NPIP">location</span>, the same thing, we could be together with.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="752">Can you tell me the story about him?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="753">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="754">well, Wagner, as I said, was really somebody the most we had to be careful with.</sentence><sentence id="755">He was the most brutal one and a vicious one.</sentence><sentence id="756">He was really -- he looked for the occasion to murder somebody, to do some something bad to him.</sentence><sentence id="757">He was, he was himself and he had the occasion to do things like that, so he very often he sneaked in at night, you know, or in the 2 evening when we are just walking around in this <span class="DLF">lot</span>, in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we lived, just to, to, to sneak out, to suspicious, to see something.</sentence><sentence id="758">Maybe he's stalking to somebody.</sentence><sentence id="759">I know he went in once to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, one of -- there was a young fellow, he was a Kapo and he slept, and he went in, in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, he start to wake him and he wasn't reacting quick enough so he took him out with a -- he killed him.</sentence><sentence id="760">He killed him because he didn't react rightly on it.</sentence><sentence id="761">A matter of fact, the uprising later maybe I will tell -- we geared it so -- they went every three months they went on vacation, so we all -- we planned it to have anything -- when we planned the uprising we planned it so that he is not in that time there.</sentence><sentence id="762">He is on vacation in that time.</sentence><sentence id="763">Now, while I'm talking about reminds me, the Germans went every, as I say, every three months they went to vacation.</sentence><sentence id="764">Now when they do that, when they went there, they always prepared them to go on vacation.</sentence><sentence id="765">What that mean is, they took all the best clothes what they could find, they -- some of the valuables what the people had with them -- that they had the biggest suitcase and they filled up all these things.</sentence><sentence id="766">They filled it up till they couldn't even carry it, it was so heavy.</sentence><sentence id="767">And each, each one of them took <span class="BUILDING">home</span> these big suitcases and with especially the Dutch people brought really nice things with them, and they took all these things.</sentence><sentence id="768">They took them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for themselves, so that was really for them a big holiday.</sentence><sentence id="769">To go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they took with them valuables what never more could -- they probably in their private life could never afford this kind of things, so, that was really what they did.</sentence><sentence id="770">So, that that really was for them, that was the purpose of being there, so they could steal and take the things.</sentence><sentence id="771">On top of that what they murdered, that they could steal and take the things with them.</sentence><sentence id="772">Now Wagner, the end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wagner</span> was after the war, he ran away.</sentence><sentence id="773">He ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and one of the survivors, Szmajzner", what he recently died -- he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>, too; and when it was Hitler's birthday, they, all these Germans make a coming together and he happens to be there and this Szmajzner, Szmajzner, he, he somehow found out that he saw that -- he went looking for these people.</sentence><sentence id="774">He saw him there and he recognized him, and he said, "You are Wagner."</sentence><sentence id="775">He said, "No, no, no."</sentence><sentence id="776">Anyway, it ended up that they took him to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and while he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> he hanged himself.</sentence><sentence id="777">So that was the story with Wagner.</sentence><sentence id="778">But while being in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we were really -- if we were afraid to the most it was for him.</sentence><sentence id="779">So really that was really a beast.</sentence><sentence id="780">He, he was so vicious.</sentence><sentence id="781">He was looking already that he can murder somebody, kill somebody.</sentence><sentence id="782">I never saw a person like that.</sentence><sentence id="783">Some of them still had sometimes, human feelings, you know.</sentence><sentence id="784">You could caught them, and catch them in a lighter moment, but this one was really just vicious.</sentence><sentence id="785">You couldn't afford even to look in his face.</sentence><sentence id="786">He didn't like you look at him and things like that, so there were -- before me were there even also were others what I didn't -- Stangldeg, I think, but I, I didn't -- I was not in the time when Stang] was.</sentence><sentence id="787">I don't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="788">I only from I heard from the others telling -- he had a dog and he martyred people with the dog and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="789">Now I, I was not my time.</sentence><sentence id="790">I came in, in -- no -- yeah, I came I think in September 1942.</sentence><sentence id="791">So I was 11 months I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because the uprising was in October, so that was not my time.</sentence><sentence id="792">there was transport &gt; Stanislaw Szmajzner deg $S-Hauptsturmfiihrer Franz Stangl 3 came really -- sometimes they came -- I remember just talking about -- I remember there came a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="793">There was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and there was a lot of people, half-dead, dead, no clothes.</sentence><sentence id="794">Terrible, I never saw something like that.</sentence><sentence id="795">It's just unbelievable -- half-skeletons.</sentence><sentence id="796">The people looked just unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="797">They must have had a big trip, no food, muddled up before that, so they want to get it over as quick as possible, so we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolleys</span>, like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> what you have in the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span>, what you swing back and forth, you might have seen them.</sentence><sentence id="798">So they said all the bodies we had to throw on, on this to take it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Three</span>.</sentence><sentence id="799">And there were half-live people.</sentence><sentence id="800">We just had to throw them together with the, with the live people -- with the dead people together, so I see an old lady, a gentle face and things like that and it was on top of all these bodies.</sentence><sentence id="801">She couldn't hardly talk, and they all went just like that.</sentence><sentence id="802">Put half-life on, whatever lived still, on the fire there.</sentence><sentence id="803">So things like that really -- I couldn't -- I, I couldn't bring up everything.</sentence><sentence id="804">It was so many of them I couldn't really remember everyone of them.</sentence><sentence id="805">It was horrible, horrible.</sentence><sentence id="806">I just don't have words for it.</sentence><sentence id="807">You cannot, you cannot, you cannot tell a story like that.</sentence><sentence id="808">You can tell a story, the words have not the same meaning to the listener that it has to me, because I saw it and I see the picture before me.</sentence><sentence id="809">And it's different telling a story -- no matter how good words you find for it, it still cannot give you the right picture what it is.</sentence><sentence id="810">So that is to say the most horrible thing imaginable, that what it was.</sentence><sentence id="811">If you, you cannot imagine, but, but if you could have a horrible picture of the worst of a picture, the picture, even if I were to tell it, because so bad was it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="875">A: Well, as I said, we all got -- the food was -- you had in the -- we got -- well in the morning we got our slice of bread, a heavy slice of bread, black bread and black water.</sentence><sentence id="876">It was not to drink but that's all you get, and in the evenings we had a soup.</sentence><sentence id="877">As I said, we called it the straw soup.</sentence><sentence id="878">It was from corn, I don't know exactly the name of it, it's with the peels, the corn with the peels, so you couldn't really swallow that and we called that the "spit soup."</sentence><sentence id="879">Now some people couldn't eat it and they just didn't eat and die.</sentence><sentence id="880">They couldn't eat it.</sentence><sentence id="881">Especially the Dutch people, what were used to a little bit better life, so they couldn't, and if you had to live on that you couldn't make it long.</sentence><sentence id="882">You couldn't make it long, and they -- a lot of people didn't.</sentence><sentence id="883">But we were the ones who were next to the food and we stole it.</sentence><sentence id="884">That's the reason we had more people.</sentence><sentence id="885">It was illegal, dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="886">They would have shot you if they catch you, but we nevertheless we did it, so the -- as far as food concerns, that was really the situation, but if you think about how they fed you -- forget about it.</sentence><sentence id="887">You couldn't make it at all.</sentence><sentence id="888">You couldn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="889">And, clothes -- as I said, we came with different clothes and we just changed.</sentence><sentence id="890">If, if it was ripped or whatever, we changed to another clothes.</sentence><sentence id="891">Just that what kind of thing, but they didn't supply you anything.</sentence><sentence id="892">They gave you -- they treated you like a commodity, not like a, a human being, not at all.</sentence><sentence id="893">You were not a human being.</sentence><sentence id="894">You just had 4 to listen the order what you got and to do it, just like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">robot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="895">You had to do things what you are told and if you didn't do it right, they did away with you.</sentence><sentence id="896">No fooling around.</sentence><sentence id="897">And then was, a punishment for whatever reason, the whole evening instead after eating we could go and be in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="898">They didn't bring you to eat and they take you around, running around, put down -- as a punishment; they let you ran, ran, and ran, fell down and get up, fell down and get up for hour, two hours, till you got so exhausted and tired, some people died on the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="899">They couldn't make it, and some, the younger ones, they, they did it, so there was a punishment.</sentence><sentence id="900">Things like that happen.</sentence><sentence id="901">As I say, they tried to martyr you.</sentence><sentence id="902">They tried to take away any thinking of you, that you don't -- you're not on a human being, you're not functioning as a human being.</sentence><sentence id="903">Just you have to be a robot and to kill you, any thinking, any initiative, anything -- just to do what you're told and to keep you as long as they need you.</sentence><sentence id="904">So we really were not human beings in their thinking and their functioning and in regard to us, so they didn't come for that.</sentence><sentence id="905">So they exploit us as much as they could.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="942">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="943">We're on.</sentence><sentence id="944">Let's pick up now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="948">A: Well, we were always knowing what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="949">We were talking about an uprising.</sentence><sentence id="950">In other words, we talking about running away somehow, organized.</sentence><sentence id="951">There was a small group.</sentence><sentence id="952">I was not involved in this group.</sentence><sentence id="953">And there was a lot of talking about how to run away.</sentence><sentence id="954">Now there were many plans how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="955">It was not an easy task.</sentence><sentence id="956">There were always <span class="DLF">mines</span> around, guards around, and there were about a 150, 200 Ukrainian guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on top of the Germans, so that was really a very difficult task to find somehow a way to get out.</sentence><sentence id="957">And -- till one day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="958">That was about -- on -- not far from the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> where the Germans caught them, the prisoners of war, so they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="959">From this group they picked out around 30 people to work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and these people when they came in and they heard what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="960">They're all soldiers so, and a different spirit, said they want to run away the first day.</sentence><sentence id="961">So we tried to explain to them that it is not so easy. "</sentence><sentence id="962">Where do you run?</sentence><sentence id="963">You don't have the cooperation from the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> even if you make it already <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and, it's not so easy."</sentence><sentence id="964">And we told them also that we have our own plans and we wanted to do the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="965">Maybe we can talk together and come up with a common things, and we all can do the same thing together, what made sense, and they agreed on it.</sentence><sentence id="966">And after many secretive meetings in the evening, we, after work, we came together and we talk with them and we talked on different plans, different possibilities, so -- till one day we came upon a plan that we make an uprising on this way.</sentence><sentence id="967">We worked till it was the time of October, what about five o'clock they brought us back already to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> because they want us always bring back before dark, so we decided at four o'clock we start to make an uprising in this way.</sentence><sentence id="968">In each group what worked like we, for example, with separating the clothes; we had two three Germans what were supervision over us.</sentence><sentence id="969">They supervised us and each group what worked in different ways had two or three Germans what they were there to watch them, how they work.</sentence><sentence id="970">So we decided in each group to assign two people and these people with some pretext, they will have to get them to a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> or somewhere and quietly kill them with a knife or an axe or whatever and just do it like nothing happened and in, in the meantime also to cut the, the wires and as I said, as I said before, we tried to gear to do it in the time when Wagner was on vacation; so that was really not safe, but safer.</sentence><sentence id="971">And that was -- and so as I say, we was assigned people in each group to do this kind of work.</sentence><sentence id="972">Now there were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where we lived, there was a goldsmith, a tailor, a shoemaker and that they made for them clothes, shoes, these people there; so they made, they had to come to fit, so they told them, "In this day I will have the fit for you.</sentence><sentence id="973">Come then, and I will have the fit for you your shoes or your clothes."</sentence><sentence id="974">6 And when they came there they were already people with this axe of knives.</sentence><sentence id="975">They were hiding behind a, a curtain or something, and they killed them on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="976">When they came in to fit, they overwhelmed them and they killed them, and shoved them in under the, under somewhere that nobody sees, and, and the work went through like nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="977">And so I was not assigned to anything because, you see, I went with Selma and Selma didn't speak Polish and the whole plan was very secretive.</sentence><sentence id="978">Although it was planned for all of people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, because everybody could run away, but not many people were told were about -- be afraid it might come out, leak out and then we all gone, so whoever was, didn't speak the language, didn't know somebody, so it was secretive.</sentence><sentence id="979">So I had my friends there and I knew everything that's going on; but I was not assigned to anything because of that, because I was with, with Selma, because she didn't speak Polish.</sentence><sentence id="980">So where I worked there, there were some people assigned to kill by the clothes where I worked, the separating the clothes.</sentence><sentence id="981">And then there were two people what assigned to go to kill somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, a German in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and the last minute one of them got scared and he didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="982">And I was there and I heard the story and I knew already that there's 10 to 12 Germans were already killed, so I know -- the ordeal I know already.</sentence><sentence id="983">We are already -- unless we get out, otherwise we are dead.</sentence><sentence id="984">So, Selma brought me a knife with a point, knife.</sentence><sentence id="985">I said I wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="986">You see, from all these people what people brought from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, utensils and all the things, there were a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for it, and we're not far from this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, so she went there in and she picked a knife, a pointed knife.</sentence><sentence id="987">She gave me a knife, and I went with the other fellow.</sentence><sentence id="988">I don't think I was a big hero or a big, courageous man, but I figured it's self-defense and survival.</sentence><sentence id="989">If1 don't do it, it might spoil the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="990">So I, I instinctively -- is not decision.</sentence><sentence id="991">It's not a decision.</sentence><sentence id="992">You just react, instinctively you react to that, and I figured, "Let us to do, and go and do it."</sentence><sentence id="993">And I went.</sentence><sentence id="994">I went with the man in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and we killed this German.</sentence><sentence id="995">With every jab, I said, "That is for my father, for my mother, for all these people, all the Jews you killed;" and I -- my knife slipped out, slid out from my hand and I cut myself and I was full with blood and when he was dead we ran out of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and we were lucky.</sentence><sentence id="996">Just came a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came with Germans on it, but I somehow -- there was -- the, the idea was when at this comes five o'clock that we all go back to from work to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> like nothing happened, and that was just in that time and Selma went with this group and she saw me and she took a, a nap-- napkin or whatever she had with them, she tied me up there, wiped off the blood from me and I went with this group till the main <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> where we where we came in and all the groups in all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> came in, because it was five o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="997">Then we all start to run away.</sentence><sentence id="998">Everybody ran in different directions.</sentence><sentence id="999">I tell it so quick, but, it, it was more tension because it was a whole hour was going on, so we were very tense.</sentence><sentence id="1000">We knew there were already Germans killed.</sentence><sentence id="1001">We knew already it's going on, so we just hoped that nobody unexpectedly comes a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he doesn't supposed to come and finds out what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1002">If that is, then we all killed and lost, so somehow we are lucky with that.</sentence><sentence id="1003">We killed these Germans 7 wherever we worked and everything went accordingly to the plan, till we came to the main <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1004">Now we could -- people ran, ran all over, so the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> knew already what's going on by then, so some ran on the <span class="DLF">mines</span>, got killed.</sentence><sentence id="1005">Some people didn't ran at all.</sentence><sentence id="1006">They gave up.</sentence><sentence id="1007">They didn't want to run.</sentence><sentence id="1008">They just gave up.</sentence><sentence id="1009">They, they just waited till they get killed.</sentence><sentence id="1010">But the younger people, most of them, and whoever was courageous enough to run, they ran away and then a lot ran on the main <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Now we started to run and we were next to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and then I saw Frenzel with a machine gun, and he started to shoot and more people were running and I, I wanted to hold back because afraid for the machine gun, and I figured, "Here is dead.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Here is maybe something."</sentence><sentence id="1013">So I pulled Selma's hand and we ran through and somehow, some fell and we made it through the through the <span class="DLF">gate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1014">So we were lucky we came through.</sentence><sentence id="1015">So that is really, I think some luck was with us.</sentence><sentence id="1016">So we came through that and then we ended up -- it started to be dark, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, so when we came out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> we ended up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and it was rainy and it was wet and she had some boots on and somehow the boots didn't right, so she pulled it off and she couldn't get it on, so she ran with one boot, half on the foot and on the, on the heel like that, you know, she ran.</sentence><sentence id="1017">We ran the whole night and we didn't know where we ran; and till it started to get light, dawn.</sentence><sentence id="1018">And what I forgot to tell you is when we knew when we go away, we took money from the people.</sentence><sentence id="1019">The money what we should have given to the Germans or sabotage, we took with us some because we figured if we go out, we probably will need it if we have any chance to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1020">So we took some with us, so when we came -- we figured -- the first night we came next to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we saw a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I figured, "Let me go and ask if they can keep us over the day," because they were searching there all over.</sentence><sentence id="1021">So, and I told them I -- whatever the figure was -- I had dollars, gold, things like that, so I told them I would give them so much money.</sentence><sentence id="1022">He probably never heard so much money what I gave him, so he agreed to hold us over the day.</sentence><sentence id="1023">They took us in.</sentence><sentence id="1024">And it happened we were six miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1025">And later we heard that in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they were searching the whole day.</sentence><sentence id="1026">They found a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="1027">I don't know if all of them -- they found of them and took them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and shot them.</sentence><sentence id="1028">And it happened we were lucky, they didn't, didn't find us.</sentence><sentence id="1029">So, and then we, we, we ran, we - - no -- when it got dark, we left this farmer and he told us a little direction.</sentence><sentence id="1030">Now I was thinking because I didn't know where to go, what to go, so I was thinking I worked at the farmer before I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span>, I figured, "Let me try.</sentence><sentence id="1031">Maybe, you never know, maybe -- he was a nice person as I said, he was a nice person.</sentence><sentence id="1032">Maybe he might do something."</sentence><sentence id="1033">Now I didn't know direction.</sentence><sentence id="1034">We couldn't go on the <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1035">We went in the <span class="DLF">field</span> always, because we are afraid they will catch us and not to be found, so we went in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1036">We didn't -- what we looked is on the, on the Big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wagen</span>", on Der Nipper(r), Nipper.</sentence><sentence id="1037">I don't know I went the right direction.</sentence><sentence id="1038">Anyway, that was our guide to where to go where to go, so we ended up at 7 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> (German); "Der Grofe Wagen" or "The Big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Wagon</span>" is a colloquial German term for the constellation Ursula Major. *</sentence><sentence id="1039">the sipper (German) 8 night, we walked in dark, and during the day we tried to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1040">Either, we tried to go into a farmer in the morning, very early in the morning, give him money; or sometimes we were not so lucky so we were hiding in sometimes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> during the day or on an open <span class="DLF">field</span> or we went in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hoykh barg</span>" or something.</sentence><sentence id="1041">And one day we couldn't find a farmer, we couldn't find anybody, and we ended up on a top of a high barg"(r), and it happened during the day some children came there to play and there was a sport to go on this and they found us, and they started right, "Jews, Jews, Jews."</sentence><sentence id="1042">I said, "Selma, let's quick run away," and we ran away.</sentence><sentence id="1043">They couldn't find anyone, so we ran away.</sentence><sentence id="1044">I don't know, we got out and while we were running there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> haul-- wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with farmers.</sentence><sentence id="1045">They didn't know that I speak Polish, and he said, "Come, we will take you.</sentence><sentence id="1046">Come, we'll take you."</sentence><sentence id="1047">And I was on one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and Selma was on the other one, and I hear in Polish they say, "Let them take it -- we will, we will do something for them," whatever -- not, not good, so I screamed to Selma, "Jump!</sentence><sentence id="1048">Jump!"</sentence><sentence id="1049">And I jumped and she jumped, and I let them go and we went away, so We ran away.</sentence><sentence id="1050">So for about two weeks we ran, sometimes coming to a farmer, sometimes not, but every time when we were at a farmer, we tried to tell them that we have some money.</sentence><sentence id="1051">We want to give them this money, and if he wants to keep us over the war.</sentence><sentence id="1052">It was already in the end of "43 and, the Russians moved back and forth, so, so maybe they figured that maybe it wouldn't take so long and they might willing to do it, till one day we came to a farmer and we asked him that.</sentence><sentence id="1053">And he said, "Listen.</sentence><sentence id="1054">I am too near to my neighbors and I am not able to do it for you, but I have a brother of mine what lives about 10 miles away or 10 kilometers away.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Let me bring you there to him and maybe -- he lives a
