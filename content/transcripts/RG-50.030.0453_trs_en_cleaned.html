class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">From <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> we registered in the HIAS in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish immigration

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> 15 months approximately, because I was working on hire -- they</sentence></p><p><sentence id="228">hired me, after three months I started to speak Italian, because I had learned it in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> when I went, so I learned very easy.</sentence><sentence id="229">So I was working one year in <span class="BUILDING">HIAS</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, like an interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="230">So I stayed 15 months, you know -- and by the way, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>, to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, first of all, we to -- under communism it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you going -- secondly, there was no Jews, so I didn't have the opportunity to go.</sentence><sentence id="231">So I went to a little <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, and suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a ticket, a steady ticket, a year's ticket for my father for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">Can you imagine?</sentence><sentence id="233">And I had here the card, not long time ago, and I am very sorry, I cannot find.</sentence><sentence id="234">I was looking, and I don't remember if I gave it to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>, or I put somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="235">And I had the card for many years, and I'm sorry, otherwise I would give the card to you, to show that it was -- and when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, and they called me the first time to the -- I had -- had the aliyah, to show -- to called me to the Torah.</sentence><sentence id="236">And I was very fluent, I remember, because I wa -- go back to how it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and was praying.</sentence><sentence id="237">So I said the first brocha by the <span class="BUILDING">aliyah</span> very fluently.</sentence><sentence id="238">And suddenly, when I had to continue, suddenly I stopped and I couldn't get a word from my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="239">And they thought, the people who are standing next to me, they thought that, what's happened?</sentence><sentence id="240">What's</sentence></p><p><sentence id="243">hap -- and it took me about two minutes to ga -- get -- continue because I was -- I was so excited, and for me was -- is so something that I cannot imagine, I couldn't imagine that after so many years I'm standing in front of the Torah by a-aliyah.</sentence><sentence id="244">So then I told them, so they told me they can understand that.</sentence><sentence id="245">So that what it happened to me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">And I wanted only to say that in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, because it was very dangerous to have some prayers or to go to a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">So I had the prayer book, and my father gave me the idea -- we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">And behind the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span>, in the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, in the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span> was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">So I put the prayer book in back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span>, and besi -- behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span>, I put a plywood, so when you opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span>, you couldn't see nothing in the back.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="250">And from the back I made a little <span class="DLF">hole</span>, a small <span class="DLF">hole</span> that you can push down the -- the plywood with a wire.</sentence><sentence id="251">So it was a small -- and when I opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and I pushed the -- with th-the wire the plywood, so the plywood came down and I took my prayer book.</sentence><sentence id="252">So at least on the high holidays, approximate, I knew where they are, so I was praying, because otherwise what -- when my sister escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> with her husband in 1948, and then my other sister with her husband in 1950, illegally, and I gave some money out, I helped them.</sentence><sentence id="253">So then it was very dangerous because the police came after me.</sentence><sentence id="254">I was in -- even in <span class="BUILDING">custody</span> for -- for a few days, and they even slapped me because I didn't want to tell them h-</sentence></p><p><sentence id="257">ho -- which way my sister escaped and left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">So, then I -- so I knew that was genderus -- dangerous to pray, so that's way -- and I knew that exactly, at least twice during the time in those year, in 1950 - "51, maybe "52, the secret police came during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work, they were checking my a-- our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for certain things they will find, because -- especially my wife, she realized -- she opened, for example there, her underwear was, that it was put a different way back, or our other things what we had in our <span class="INT_SPACE">drawers</span>, or in the -- in our -- in our <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">So that's -- we knew exactly they were secretly -- they came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to check, and to make -- if they will find something against me.</sentence><sentence id="260">Maybe they were more times than twice, but twice we knew exactly for sure.</sentence><sentence id="261">So when I -- they took me many times, about three times I wa -- I think, to the secret police, and they were even telling me, if I won't tell how the -- my sister went, and what connections I have with my sisters overseas in the west, that they will send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jachymov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">This was very a dangerous [indecipherable] it was uran-uranium -- uranium m-mine, that they were sending the worst criminals or politically who are dangerous for them.</sentence><sentence id="263">And most of the people even died then in those <span class="DLF">mines</span>, or if they after many years they were lucky, came

then we, after two weeks they send us to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3482">There we registered in the HIAS, and immediately -- it was very good organized there, and immediately they gave us -- because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> there were all over signs that say, lease <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, special for refugees becal -- twas meant -- so, we took out an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3483">And the hia -- HIAS, actually Joint, gave the money that what we paid for the rent, and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or something, minimum, but it was enough.</sentence><sentence id="3484">And after three months or so, because when I went in <span

the other woman my -- my -- who was in charge, my caseworker, she was a Romanian too, and she spoke -- spoke Hungarian too.</sentence><sentence id="3491">So said one thing to other, and I talked to

from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3492">So I was working one year approximately on HIAS like a interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="3493">So, me, my wife actually stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> 15 months.</sentence><sentence id="3494">And between this time it helped a lot, because we received money like refugees, like everybody else.</sentence><sentence id="3495">And beside that, Joint paid me like a employee on HIAS.</sentence><sentence id="3496">So we started to travel a little bit in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and I spoke Italian.</sentence><sentence id="3497">So actually in -- was in -- my job was there.</sentence><sentence id="3498">At least once a week, sometimes twice a week, I went to the <span

people.</sentence><sentence id="3504">I [inaudible] have to tell you, I gave them money, because I had -- I --I had the</sentence><sentence id="3506">Interview with Mikulas Judikovic April 14, 1997

on.</sentence><sentence id="3508">I said, buongiorno signore, I gave them the envelope, arrivederci.</sentence><sentence id="3509">And that's was I took over all the people I took them to HIAS for

on.</sentence><sentence id="3512">So I went with them to interpret on the -- on the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> because I spoke Italian there.</sentence><sentence id="3513">And then I took all the passports, and all papers, translation, everything, to all those consulates for what -- for -- for verification, because usually they get permission, the Italian government gave permission for refugees for three months.</sentence><sentence id="3514">Who stayed longer, I had to go to the police, I had to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get permission.</sentence><sentence id="3515">So that's what I did for HIAS, what I went then -- and then all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, what all they sent for example, many people to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> or to us, or I accompanied these people to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3516">And sometimes people came illegally to -- they send them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3517">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, I took over those people and took to the -- not to the e-exit with other people, but to the -- to the Italian police, you know, to the commandant of the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3518">And he knew everything, so he gave the permission, and then when I took them to HIAS, you</sentence><sentence id="3520">Interview with

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3643">A: I went, and in the begin -- the first year, you know, this prayer book, the -- I don't know what's happened, because maybe the -- if something -- because yeah, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, all the clothing, everything what we -- when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> we had to leave there, and the government took it over.</sentence><sentence id="3644">Even they gave it to someone or someone -- someone bought it.</sentence><sentence id="3645">So an -- for example, it was -- and they took here

we left illegally.</sentence><sentence id="3646">So that means if we would go back during those period, there it was the communist, first we will go in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, maybe they will</sentence><sentence id="3648">Interview with Mikulas Judikovic ss April 14, 1997 for two years, maybe th -- even more.</sentence><sentence id="3649">So when they started to liquidate -- before

all.</sentence><sentence id="3654">So then the first -- the first -- 1946 - "47, I used to go to a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> in <span

were afraid to go to a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3658">They didn't go, even they were religious.</sentence><sentence id="3659">So then -- and when I came back, in

some people told me, you know, I remember when I had about, in 1946 -- 47 a old guy, so I remember you used to come, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3664">And then later on they had very few re -- Jews.</sentence><sentence id="3665">And then</sentence><sentence id="3667">Interview with Mikulas Judikovic ms April 14, 1997 they came, for example, for the high holidays, they came Jews from <span
