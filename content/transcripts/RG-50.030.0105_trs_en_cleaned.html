<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: Tell us just what happened next.</sentence><sentence id="90">What did you do once you realized...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Well, uh it was Friday morning.</sentence><sentence id="94">I 1 I remember it very well.</sentence><sentence id="95">I was fifteen you see.</sentence><sentence id="96">It was Friday morning when we heard a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and people ran into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and uh and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> and we ran out and saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> with the swastika flying over.</sentence><sentence id="97">It was terribly exciting and and a lot of activities started then.</sentence><sentence id="98">They were building <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and uh and you know, uh my mother tried to keep sort of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> down, were closed so from my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>...my father was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">My father was quite ill and that night uh there were lots of of refugees on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">You know, people running away and and there was was shooting.</sentence><sentence id="101">I remember one one man was carrying a goat on his back.</sentence><sentence id="102">Apparently it was his only possession, a small goat and people with wheelbarrows and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> and everything and my brother had a girlfriend and apparently her uh family called and said that they are going to flee into the interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and suggested that they would take my brother and me along and my father insisted that should be my brother's decision.</sentence><sentence id="103">I was, you know, considered too young to make a decision.</sentence><sentence id="104">My brother was nineteen at the time and my brother said no, we we're not going to go.</sentence><sentence id="105">We will stay together.</sentence><sentence id="106">You you'll need us.</sentence><sentence id="107">My father was ill, and and that was a terrible shock because, you know, my father to me was sort of the center of my universe.</sentence><sentence id="108">I mean, you know, when Poppa decreed something, he would do anything and that he should suddenly ask us, particularly my brother, to make a decision...such a momentous decision.</sentence><sentence id="109">I remember it was a terrible shock and uh it was very turbulent night and when it ceased in the morning and my father said to me that I I should go and apparently he wanted to talk to my mother and my brother that I should not be around and he said that I should call the family to see what everyone is doing, my father's brothers and there were uncles and aunts and so on, and I went downstairs and uh the ring of the telephone...there was no answer.</sentence><sentence id="110">No one answered anywhere and uh you know, I remember suddenly it was like like you were left in a world of the dead, you know, all those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that I remembered and the phones were ringing and ringing and there was no answer whatsoever and uh when I came up my father said no one answers today, and I said no.</sentence><sentence id="111">And it was a wonderful Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="112">Everything was cut off.</sentence><sentence id="113">There was...we had no electricity, no light and it was a beautiful, calm September day, flowers <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and my parents were sort of joking.</sentence><sentence id="114">My father got dressed and came downstairs and we were all sitting together and it was really the the last beautiful day.</sentence><sentence id="115">And then in the evening they start with some shelling and my brother went out to let his dog in and when he came back he he had a hole in his trousers and he said they were shooting from the <span class="DLF">rooftops</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">The Germans were coming but we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with some other people, you know, and it was morning.</sentence><sentence id="117">Then I I don't remember those hours too well, but what I remember most vividly is uh that my mother called, said we should come.</sentence><sentence id="118">She had prepared some breakfast and we came upstairs and we sat down.</sentence><sentence id="119">Suddenly, this tremendous roar, the roar of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> with Nazis in it, two...one in the side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and on sitting up there, and my brother had just, he had a wristwatch, but he had just taken it out of his pocket because he carried it in his pocket, and I saw his, you know, his hand was down and it was 9:10 in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="120">And I remember everybody just sat there totally stunned and then we heard people uh running.</sentence><sentence id="121">There were more more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> were coming and and people were shouting, heil Hitler, and we saw from from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> the black swastika flag and I think that was the most enormous shock, that people were prepared, was our neighbors, you know, our friends, and they knew it in the very first hour and uh to me, and of course, you know, you can only see it in in retrospect and of course I lived it many times, but one of the things uh it sort of changed suddenly.</sentence><sentence id="122">I remember uh the coal fell out from the cradle of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> and uh it went on the carpet and the carpet was sort of smoldering and and no one paid any attention to it and I remember it had once happened before...how upset my mother was and no one paid any attention.</sentence><sentence id="123">These were just tiny little vignettes which suddenly sort of you know changed everything.</sentence><sentence id="124">And uh shortly thereafter perhaps...you know, then more and more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> of soldiers were coming and and the voices grew more hoarse, people shouting heil Hitler and I I saw a childhood friend of mine carrying white roses to to the soldiers and somebody was giving the soldiers schnapps and flowers for and the whole sort of thing and I I remember starting to cry and my brother dragged me on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">carpet</span> and he said, keep quiet, you know, you you can't do that, and he took me up to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and _ he said, you know, don't make a sound and it was in the after...it was in the morning...I mean, you know, uh the whole day was sort of uh melange (ph) of many many feelings which I try to remember over the years, but one of of the worst things happened that afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="125">Uh the mother of the childhood friend of mine...she blessedly is alive and she lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>...her name is Esther Bergman (ph).</sentence><sentence id="126">Her mother came and she asked where my father was and she said uh...but she knew that he was ill but she said,also to my brother that no man should go on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because they had rounded up all the men that they could find and they locked them in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and they set the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> aflame and then she sort of went out by the <span class="DLF">back door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">And I think that was truly the first impact what happened.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: What happened over the next few days?</sentence><sentence id="165">How did uh things 2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: I couldn't you tell you day by day, you know.</sentence><sentence id="169">Uh people came.</sentence><sentence id="170">Our our neighbors came, our non-Jewish neighbors came...oh, one thing, yes...uh a neighbor who, you know...she...the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in which we lived in not only was I and my brother born there but my mother had been born there.</sentence><sentence id="171">It was a <span class="BUILDING">family home</span>, you know, and our grandmother had lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="172">Fortunately, blessedly for her, she died the year before the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="173">She, you know, never faced that.</sentence><sentence id="174">Uh a woman came and she asked where our flag was, the Polish flag, you know, which used to be red and white, and uh my mother said why, and she said we have to make a German flag out of it and my mother pretended to look for it in all <span class="NPIP">places</span> where she knew she wouldn't find it, you know, and then uh the woman left and she said she would be back later.</sentence><sentence id="175">Maybe my father can help look for it, and I think that became very clear that we better produce it because she really wanted it for our protection and she said all you have to do is, you know, keep the the red flag and cut a round circle from the white, put a black swastika on it and she came to collect it.</sentence><sentence id="176">She did it and then she said she wanted to look where Arthur was because he is very strong.</sentence><sentence id="177">He should hang it up and he apparently could not be found to do it, so the woman struggled to hang the flag up and she sort of said to my mother, you know, if uh if the flag is not displayed from here, it would be pretty obvious who you are.</sentence><sentence id="178">And uh I remember we couldn't look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> to see to see that flying.</sentence><sentence id="179">We had some other people you know living in in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as well who uh who were not Jewish and some were sympathizers and of course they wanted that, because you know, this was the part which was German speaking.</sentence><sentence id="180"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bielitz</span> before the war was <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and later on it was also one of the first things that became uh it was they called it , you know, , uh where so we were unfortunately not too far from from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, which was _____, and that became the perfect which was allegedly self-ruled.</sentence><sentence id="181">Of course it wasn't, you know, but we immediately became uh under the symbols as as <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">So uh the people who...I suppose most people were German-speaking people, you see, and people were shouting uh heil Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="183">Thank you for the liberation, and things like that because they thought that you're not an Austrian Empire was coming back with, you know, Franz Joseph and the beautiful Empress Elizabeth and so on, you know, was the part had been under <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for only twenty years, so uh uh I think there was a lot of mis...perhaps misguided feeling on behalf of the people, maybe not so much pro-Nazi at that particular point, but of course all that changed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Over the next few months, what happened to you and your family and how did things change?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: What I can unfortunately tell you...uh fairly soon an order came that all young men between I think sixteen and fifty had to register.</sentence><sentence id="204">My father at that point was about fifty and since he was ill he did not have to register for a transport.</sentence><sentence id="205">My brother was nineteen and, of course, everyday you know, that we knew that <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> declared war, you know, that we knew right away.</sentence><sentence id="206">That happened Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="207">You know, we were occupied Sunday morning.</sentence><sentence id="208">Sunday afternoon uh <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">Uh then you know, most of the family had fled, our family; however, my father's sister who had uh been separated from her husband and daughter in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which which were bombed, came back with her son David and she found her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> occupied by uh by other people, and she came to stay with us.</sentence><sentence id="210">David was about my brother's age, and David and also my brother went to register to whatever they were going to do and they said that they they would be in uh in some sort of labor battalion to uh build up what was uh destroyed by the war.</sentence><sentence id="211">The date was the 19th of October on which my brother left.</sentence><sentence id="212">Anyway...I tell you one thing...my my mother refused to make his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for for months.</sentence><sentence id="213">She wanted to keep the imprint of his head on the pillow.(Pause) All things got worse from day to day, you know.</sentence><sentence id="214">We didn't hear from my brother for a long, long long time and when we finally did, which I believe was months later, he was uh blessedly in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian occupied zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">He was in .</sentence><sentence id="216">And what apparently happened was that uh they were brought into the interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> uh near the _....I don't know exactly what <span class="NPIP">location</span>...pursued by bullets.</sentence><sentence id="217">Those who were good swimmers swam across.</sentence><sentence id="218">He was a very good swimmer and he was in in , which was uh occupied by the Russians and he worked there.</sentence><sentence id="219">Uh my brother was was trained in chemistry uh and he worked in some sort of a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> making germ (ph) or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="220">Uh that was one of the greatest, marvelous moments in the bleakness of our existence to to hear that Arthur was alive.</sentence><sentence id="221">Uh I cannot...I really...I mean I was sort of refreshing my memory and looking at some of the things which I had written after the war which I have the most clear knowledge as far as dates are concerned but I know that uh it probably was a few months later that we were to move into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">It was very wet there and there was no electricity there and uh my father's uh condition deteriorated quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="223">He suddenly looked very old.</sentence><sentence id="224">Uh my mother uh who up to that point you see, because my grand...we had lived with my grandmother and so I was rather pampered and you know, uh given to be very easily discouraged and upset about uh little things like uh you know, table clothes didn't iron properly, or the lace was wrong or something...uh showed incredible strength and fortitude.</sentence><sentence id="225">As a matter of fact she was the one who did not cry when my brother left.</sentence><sentence id="226">And my father wept.</sentence><sentence id="227">The first time I saw my father crying.</sentence><sentence id="228">It was sort of reversal of of roles you see and I think to to me a very devastating thing to see my father helpless and and I never saw my father helpless before and uh so we lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">Uh I learned new skills.</sentence><sentence id="230">I saw my mother uh bringing an old...it was called petroleum lampiere (ph), you know...uh lamp....I learned to clean the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> of the lamp and if we got some guests to to make illumination like that, because we had no light.</sentence><sentence id="231">Uh pretty soon of course, you know, uh we exhausted our funds because we we had no no money.</sentence><sentence id="232">You know, everything was frozen.</sentence><sentence id="233">My father didn't earn anything and all those things were very hard to come by but where we lived, you know, there there were vegetables and things were obtainable and our our neighbors... [hada __, you know, a nanny, who was wonderful to us and she lived diagonally across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she would go and get vegetables and bring things to us but uh my mother was always a wonderful needlewoman.</sentence><sentence id="234">She could do wonderful things with her hands, so we sort of through that we would be knitting and I learned to...I learned to knit before the war but I wasn't particularly interested in that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="235">I was more of a tomboy running around with cats and climbing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and and I settled down and we would start knitting sweaters for people.</sentence><sentence id="236">My mother really had a wonderful reputation.</sentence><sentence id="237">You know, she would embroider things on sweaters.</sentence><sentence id="238">She did some marvelous things and uh we would be able to get candles.</sentence><sentence id="239">We had quite a store of candles because uh we couldn't use the lamp too often because petroleum was available, you know, on only limited things and our ration card...we got ration card, you know, with the name Jew and and there was very little to eat and uh so uh my mother and I would would knit for as long as daylight would allow and my father would sit and read to us.</sentence><sentence id="240">And really this is how uh my father was wonderful..you see, I went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">Even so, my first language was German...spoke German at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and when I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I would switch to German, but I couldn't read or write German, you know.</sentence><sentence id="242">I spoke it naturally.</sentence><sentence id="243">It was my first language.</sentence><sentence id="244">So my father unearthed my mother's books and he started teaching me to read and write German, and then my father would read to us, you know, and and we would let the candle go down.</sentence><sentence id="245">Then we would take take some wax and my mother made uh little wicks and we would put the candle on again and we would uh we would knit.</sentence><sentence id="246">We got...I remember it very clearly...for knitting a sweater, uh intricate sweater.</sentence><sentence id="247">You know, at first I would just knit the sleeves and things and my mother would do the intricate work.</sentence><sentence id="248">We would get uh thirty .</sentence><sentence id="249">Well, it was thirty if you could buy food on ration it was fine, but we had to start buying food on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, so I would say uh roughly a loaf of bread would cost thirty marks so for knitting a sweater we would able to buy roughly a loaf of bread.</sentence><sentence id="250">And this is how things went.</sentence><sentence id="251">And then started the things of the , you know.</sentence><sentence id="252">It was uh to be sent away and every so often a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> would come announcing that...as a matter of fact the first one came uh when we had not heard from Arthur, and I remember at that point my my mother sort of must have suffered a nervous breakdown, at least a momentary lapse because I remember she was she was totally out of things.</sentence><sentence id="253">She was calling for Arthur.</sentence><sentence id="254">She was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">And my father was up with her and my father told me to go and to pack.</sentence><sentence id="256">We we were supposed to leave with twenty pounds of our belongings.</sentence><sentence id="257">And uh my father bought for us sort of __little suitcases and he told me to to pack some things and and word got around to uh in the community that we were selling things.</sentence><sentence id="258">Everybody...I mean all the Jews..that was the way to do it, and people started to come.</sentence><sentence id="259">My father said whatever anybody gives you, take it, and he stayed with my mother, and then uh word got around that if...I don't remember the exact amount...let's say uh kilo gold...something like that...it might have been less, it might been more.</sentence><sentence id="260">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="261">If that would be given and then that would stay , so you know, everybody scurried to get whatever jewelry people had to bring it...of course that was another...was what the Germans did in order to to get the valuables which people were holding and .</sentence><sentence id="262">And apparently they got what uh whatever was needed for for that purpose because uh then a note came to say we could stay.</sentence><sentence id="263">You know, , and that would happen roughly every six, seven months, and again I I don't know exactly that, but uh but is after we got, you know, my mother seemed to bounce back and became her her strong self and and from that time on I would say until the very end, my mother was absolutely a tower of

id="566">There was...there were two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> and uh I mean again there's a story about a young man there who

id="569">Uh however I knew that if I did that I would probably have to marry __.</sentence><sentence id="570">I made the decision not to go.</sentence><sentence id="571">Uh maybe this is a good story to tell because I that I uh I wanted to stay with my friends even though I knew I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="572">By strange, almost incredible coincidence, the man inthe who came and told me that I was able to go out...his name is Jacob Chancer (ph).</sentence><sentence id="573">He now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, where of course I lived for many years.</sentence><sentence id="574">That decision proved to be a decision which saved my life because unfortunately the Briggs (ph) family, all of them, were deported and killed about two months later.</sentence><sentence id="575">And you see uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span>, my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, was renown for its textiles.</sentence><sentence id="576">Uh it was called of <span class="REGION">central Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">And uh in the they registered your name, your age, and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> you hail from (ph), and industrialists from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would come to buy

textile-oriented and associated firms and they needed people to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="579">When he came and he saw that x number of girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> were there, for some reason he thought we might have more ex in weaving or whatever and anyway they were 1 always looking because you see that still fairly early.</sentence><sentence id="580">That was "42.</sentence><sentence id="581">They needed German speaking people to be trained, so he bought all of us for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenhein</span> (ph) which was a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">weaving camp</span> in .</sentence><sentence id="582">And in fact this is where we went.</sentence><sentence id="583">In all fairness I must say that uh that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was probably better than than most of certainly what followed because it was new.</sentence><sentence id="584">You see, we were only fifty girls there.</sentence><sentence id="585">And the person who became our lager fuhrer, at first sight she looked like a bulldog and I thought she's going to tear us limb from limb, and she was a very kind person.</sentence><sentence id="586">She was probably chosen for her looks but we all who were in captivity under her owe her a debt of gratitude.</sentence><sentence id="587">And I think by her very decency she pinned a lie to the lips of all who said they had no choices.</sentence><sentence id="588">I won't say she particularly loved us.</sentence><sentence id="589">She saved my life once for which I'll be eternally grateful and there was uh as far as I know and I do know, that as long as we were there and later in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> (ph) where she also was, nobody was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> from those two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span></sentence><sentence id="590">And uh she showed that people could help individually and she did.</sentence><sentence id="591">I only met during my entire years under the Nazis, for six years, I only met two who were really kind and I think that they should be singled out for that.</sentence><sentence id="592">Frau...her name was Frau Keegler (ph), with an umlaut, so uh and we first saw her and she barked and everything...I thought this is the end of it all.</sentence><sentence id="593">Well we...1 was with my friend Yelda (ph) whom I really would like to mention and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there we became as close as sisters.</sentence><sentence id="594">Yelda was a childhood friend only in the sense that her mother and my mother were friends, you know, but Yelda played the piano beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="595">She was exquisitely mannered.</sentence><sentence id="596">My mother always told me how how I should try to be more like Yelda, you know, and of course I hated to play with her.</sentence><sentence id="597">She seemed to be the paragon of all virtue, and uh we became quite close already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when we used to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>...it was the only place you could go, but uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> you see she had a little sister by the name of Kitty and of course Kitty was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">My other friend Gretle (ph) had a sister, so the two sisters...you know, everybody sort of had a buddy and Yelda and I became that to each other.</sentence><sentence id="599">She she showed great promises as a pianist.</sentence><sentence id="600">She was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> uh two years before the war to study at the <span class="BUILDING">conservatory</span> there and uh a great future was predicted for her.</sentence><sentence id="601">And Yelda sort of became my sister.</sentence><sentence id="602">As a matter of fact, we looked quite a bit alike and uh so it was and there was something else that uh perhaps would give you sort of an inkling what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="603">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkhain</span>, I met a wonderful girl, a vivid redhead, a wonderful, you know, called beautiful people, tall, wonderful girl.</sentence><sentence id="604">Her name was Suzie Kunz (ph).</sentence><sentence id="605">She was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> but her mother had died.</sentence><sentence id="606">Uh she was quite young and since she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to live with her grandparents because you see uh in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> were mostly girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and you know we were all German speaking and this is why we went to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="607">And I was standing next to Suzie on on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="608">You know, the it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sort of uh...there was a certain freedom there you know.</sentence><sentence id="609">We were in...not confined at the ___.</sentence><sentence id="610">We were out of the and going someplace and uh Suzie said we'll never ever get out of where we are going and I said yes we will.</sentence><sentence id="611">And I said I'm sure the war will be over in less than a year, and Suzie said no, we're not going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="612">And I said I'll bet you and she said OK.</sentence><sentence id="613">She said let's bet a quart of strawberries and a quart of whipped cream and we shook hands on that.</sentence><sentence id="614">And Suzie died on liberation morning.</sentence><sentence id="615">I found her dead.</sentence><sentence id="616">I don't know if she knew or if 2 she didn't...she won that bet.</sentence><sentence id="617">Anyway we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="618"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenheim</span>...you know uh it's a terrible thing to say but but I think because we are recording that sort of thing should be said...actually for me it it was easier then.</sentence><sentence id="619">Easier in terms that I didn't see my parents suffer.</sentence><sentence id="620">You know, I could sort of put things over there but I uh I was convinced that my parents will survive, that they are someplace which they are probably working.</sentence><sentence id="621">I pushed all thoughts aside and I was in a way liberated in fact but you know I wasn't worried that each of my action might spell danger to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="622">And you know, I know if somebody's going to beat me, they aren't going to see it.</sentence><sentence id="623">All the indignities that one has suffered and you know and vice versa, you know.</sentence><sentence id="624">But of course when you're eighteen years old you know, you have the _ that you don't...anyway uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolkenheim</span> was rough in terms until we mastered what was expected of us.</sentence><sentence id="625">There was somebody there by the name of Meister Zimmer (ph).</sentence><sentence id="626">He was dreadful.</sentence><sentence id="627">And uh I used to amuse myself when he told us all things, you know, that uh that we are going to be taught decency and all the things, you know, uh that I think that that we knew so well which obviously were were designed to break our resistance, you know, and said if we behave ourselves and do these things we can live there all our lives you know, and I used to sort of speculate what he would look like when he was dead and things like that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="628">Uh now L...I...you know, fortunately uh you know I I always wrote when I was a little girl and things like that and I I could lift myself from some of the things and do other things in my mind to remove that, and I think I did that in the very first weeks when we were there.</sentence><sentence id="629">But you know, he used to sit with, stand with a watch, with a stop watch, and you had to do which are uh was very intricate uh...what do you call it...it's funny...I lapse into German now...uh to tie something, a knot, you know, a weaver's knot to be exact, and you had to do x number a minute and of course you can imagine when you have somebody standing with a stopwatch above you to do that uh your life _on that.</sentence><sentence id="630">But for some reason most of us were able to do it and those who were not were put in the spinner____ or in other things, so nobody was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from the original fifty there.</sentence><sentence id="631">And it was by comparison of what came later, relatively easy in as much...I mean we were not that hungry.</sentence><sentence id="632">We we got some food because Mrs. Keegler was decent.</sentence><sentence id="633">Uh we uh we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> long hours and I think that was really the very best thing.</sentence><sentence id="634">We were so exhausted at the end of the

working on the fortification of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and uh I wrote to my father.</sentence><sentence id="725">Uh I did not hear.</sentence><sentence id="726">Of course I heard from and I wrote to him and he started sending me letters as well as packages which again through the type of person that Mrs. Keegler was, those packages did arrive.</sentence><sentence id="727">Uh I wrote to my father and I waited to hear from my father and one day a most incredible thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="728">Mrs. Keegler was handing out mail and she called my name and I saw a letter and I jumped to get it, and then I realized it was the letter which I had wrote written to my father and on it it said, without forwarding address.</sentence><sentence id="729">Uh I think that we needn't go into that.</sentence><sentence id="730">No one think that I I lost my my speech for a day and a night.</sentence><sentence id="731">I I could not utter a sound.</sentence><sentence id="732">Anyway uh we worked there and uh the thing was uh, you see, the type of thing that I I don't know if it really comes across is the tremendous support system which existed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="733">The love and the friendship and the sharing and caring and loyalties that people had for each other, the girls had for each other.</sentence><sentence id="734">Uh you know that was sort of the balance against the cruelty which we experienced and to me I feel that was probably one of the most important things that existed and I somehow wish that would filter down.</sentence><sentence id="735">I usually attempt to tell my children and now my grandchildren because in the very odd spiritual airs of those who did not survive to know that the legacy of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> is not the legacy of the horror but of the greatness of our people, the very humanity which existed there in the face of such incredible inhumanity.</sentence><sentence id="736">Uh I particularly want to talk about my friend Yelda (ph) for a moment but that actually happened in in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">I I'll give you the quick progression from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="738">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenheim</span>, if I remember correctly when you know we were working on looms and pretty soon uh the raw materials started to disappear.</sentence><sentence id="739">We we had to uh work on uh uh paper.</sentence><sentence id="740">There was paper that they were spinning and of course you know in the warm weather it became brittle and it would break and uh in cold weather it would disintegrate because it got soft, and uh was, you know, those things tore the things which what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="741">Uh for that you could you could be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but somehow Mrs. Keegler intervened that people were not, and I remember at one time which was what I wanted to talk about Frau Keegler.</sentence><sentence id="742">Uh it was shortly after I received the news about my father uh that I became very ill.</sentence><sentence id="743">I don't know exactly what I had but I know that all my fingernails started to have pus in it and I couldn't touch my hands and 4 and I was running a very high fever and we had sort of a little...it was called in which people were sick for a day or two could stay, and I was there and all of a sudden Lindsay (ph), you know, I think he has quite a name in the SS, he came on a sudden inspection and Frau Keegler charged into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="744">I omitted to say my father made me wear my skiing boots.</sentence><sentence id="745">When I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span>...I last saw my father on the 28th of June and I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the 29th and I was separated from my mother the following day.</sentence><sentence id="746">Before my father left, he said to me wear you skiing boots.</sentence><sentence id="747">We were all avid skiers, you know.</sentence><sentence id="748">We lived in the the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ski mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">A lot of skiing there.</sentence><sentence id="750">And I said why and my father said I want you to wear them and I said Poppa, skiing shoes in June...you know, I ought to wear a pair of sandals and my father said you have to wear them.</sentence><sentence id="751">You know, you didn't argue with your father in those days.</sentence><sentence id="752">I wore them and I blessed them every single day because I wore them for the entire three years that I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and in the in the lining I had hidden the pictures which are now in my book.</sentence><sentence id="753">This is where the pictures were.</sentence><sentence id="754">At first I was able to keep them, at the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, but later on and on the death march I had concealed them there.</sentence><sentence id="755">So Mrs. Keegler charged in and she dragged me out of of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> and she said Lindsay is here.</sentence><sentence id="756">It's a matter of life and death.</sentence><sentence id="757">I'll take you to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="758">And she stooped down and she started to lace my boots and she dragged me to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">She used to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> before and I worked on four looms and she set the looms in motion and she said to me, pull yourself together and I remember I still heard the beating of the loom, you know, and everything was sort of at different angles because I was running a very high temperature and he came for inspection.</sentence><sentence id="760">He went through and if he would have found me there, she could not have saved me and there was no question about it, so that was how Keegler...but pretty soon it became obvious that the uh that they needed us in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and uh our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was disbanded and we went to uh I think three different ones, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> (ph), .</sentence><sentence id="761">I really don't remember the third one.</sentence><sentence id="762">I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> was a horrible, horrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">Uh we were locked on the fifth or <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> and uh every morning they would wake us with whips.</sentence><sentence id="765">I worked in the flax detail which was a dreadful <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="766">Uh they were doing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">linens</span> there, and flax uh submerged in a <span class="DLF">swamp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="767">You had to pull it out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span>, you know, and uh when you opened the things and retracted the flax.</sentence><sentence id="768">It was terribly hot.</sentence><sentence id="769">It was in summer and the mosquitos were all over us when we were working there and then I I was singled out to do something else, namely to unload coal at night.</sentence><sentence id="770">Allegedly I give fresh answer to uh to one of the supervisors.</sentence><sentence id="771">They are men, and for that I was banished to work the flax during the day and at the coal detail at night.</sentence><sentence id="772">Uh it was an incredible time.</sentence><sentence id="773">Then we...I also to load the flax uh into sort of <span class="BUILDING">silos</span> which were I mean I think now that they were ten stories high.</sentence><sentence id="774">They probably were not.</sentence><sentence id="775">They probably were three or four, but you know you there was no balance because __ those things.</sentence><sentence id="776">I I remember that it was nothing but torture you know.</sentence><sentence id="777">As soon as we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I was called to to go and went and unload coal and that was __ the only time.</sentence><sentence id="778">You know my father had asked me earlier...I forgot to mention it...during the first when my mother was so ill...1 remember standing at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we heard that a family had committed suicide together.</sentence><sentence id="779">And I remember standing at that <span class="DLF">window</span> looking out at the <span class="DLF">garden</span>, my mother being so sick, my father with his hand in in the sling.</sentence><sentence id="780">I hadn't...we hadn't heard from Arthur, you know, and I wished that my parents would suggest that.</sentence><sentence id="781">My father and I were both very close 5 and he always knew what I was thinking, and I remember he came behind me and he said, without looking at me, he said, what you are thinking now is cowardly.</sentence><sentence id="782">He said promise that you are never going to do that.</sentence><sentence id="783">I didn't answer him and he took his hand and he turned my head towards him and he said I want your promise now.</sentence><sentence id="784">And I promised him.</sentence><sentence id="785">And I remembered it during the working in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="786">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> going by.</sentence><sentence id="787">I didn't know if they were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or whatever, and I remember sort of the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> beckoning in the moonlight and I thought, you know, it would be over very quick.</sentence><sentence id="788">One jump and one pain and that's going to be it because it was so dreadful there.</sentence><sentence id="789">And at one moment I think I really came fairly close.</sentence><sentence id="790">I felt a very strange pain in my neck.</sentence><sentence id="791">Anyway, obviously I didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="792">So...when things were really very very hard in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> we worked in the <span class="DLF">swamp</span> one days and I think that was really one of my lowest hours, when...we had a lager fuhrer in there who was the exact opposite of Mrs. Keegler.</sentence><sentence id="793">She was maybe eighteen years old, sort of an over-blown thing and she was wearing rings on every finger and uh and her great joy was to have a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">child's wagon</span>, and she had us pull her around in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">She was having a whip about it...I mean, you can't imagine the calibre of or the intelligence of that person.</sentence><sentence id="795">And all of a sudden she came with somebody else, with a man, and they said...they were calling numbers.</sentence><sentence id="796">You see we all had numbers, of course.</sentence><sentence id="797">And they were calling numbers and I was working next to Yelda and heard them call her number, and I sort of looked up.</sentence><sentence id="798">I must have been dazed, and she pointed and the lager fuhrer and said you idiots.</sentence><sentence id="799">Don't you even know your own numbers, and Yelda pointed to me and she said that is her number.</sentence><sentence id="800">I didn't understand what she was doing.</sentence><sentence id="801">She obviously wanted to get me out from whatever it was, so the lager came and naturally slapped me and she said don't you even know your own number, you idiot and so I...and since they called my real number and we didn't know what was happening or maybe Yelda...I'm I'm really not quite sure on that, but what happened was as we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, there was Director Keller from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Waldenheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="802">Also I have an interesting thing to tell you about him.</sentence><sentence id="803">And Yelda fell to her knees and she said my sister, you don't have her number, something like that, and he looked at me and he says I know you.</sentence><sentence id="804">You worked on four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">looms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="805">You're coming along.</sentence><sentence id="806">They needed more people for uh working on looms in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> (ph) and this is how I got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> and Yelda was on it too and we got loaded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> which was the other, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sister camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">Yousee _if they had crossbars behind the open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span> and one more ____ and when we got there, who would be there but Frau Keegler was in charge of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so that was like a homecoming.</sentence><sentence id="808">So this is how...] had one incident with Keller.</sentence><sentence id="809">He called me into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> once and I just remember this most incredible thing.</sentence><sentence id="810">There was that hugh hugh <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or at least to me it seemed hugh with a single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carpet</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> on it and he sat alone at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and what struck me is that probably in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of that size, fifty of us slept.</sentence><sentence id="811">You know, I think that...and he had a letter in his hand and he said to me you have smuggled outa letter from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> _.</sentence><sentence id="812">I said I never smuggled a letter.</sentence><sentence id="813">I said I have written some letters and and when I glanced over it I saw...I had an uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> who was in the textile business because, you know, most people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> were in the textile, and my unc...and I gathered that he knew my uncle because it was a letter later on my uncle told me he had written to him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="906">Q: Who had written to who?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="908">A: My uncle had...when he found out in what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I was, had written to my, to Keller about me because he had that thing in his...Keller looked at me and he asked me a number of questions.</sentence><sentence id="909">Interesting thing was that apparently my uncle had sent a package and they encouraged me to write for more packages.</sentence><sentence id="910">The packages apparently contained chocolate and things which were not obtainable, which I never saw.</sentence><sentence id="911">They said the package must have been ripped up but it looked in a very sturdy wooden box but I was only too happy to write to my uncle that I received the packages I was told in very good order because apparently they wanted those things but this way I knew that my uncle was...I mean I knew my uncle was safe.</sentence><sentence id="912">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> but that he knew where I was.</sentence><sentence id="913">Anyway getting back to the thing...of course we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> which like <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> by comparison with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Matzdorf</span>.</sentence><sentence id="914">Uh only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> we then faced an...another difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="915">And that difficulty was that we worked the night shift only.</sentence><sentence id="916">So you know, we didn't see any light of day except, you know, uh if you got up during the day you you could and we worked there from probably a year or maybe even longer, on the night shift, but you know Frau Keegler was there.</sentence><sentence id="917">Things got worse there because there was very little food but uh she she went on in the same vein that she was before, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="928">Q: Tell us a little bit more about Landeshutz and Frau Keegler...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="930">A: Uh for instance, you know, if somebody was ill, if somebody got ill, you know, there were not the things which happened in other camps, sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or beatings or things like that.</sentence><sentence id="931">Uh you got some sort of care or understanding or it was...things were covered for you a bit, you know, as far as work was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="932">Uh she tried to to get vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="933">I don't know what rations there were, you know, but it it whatever was so- called coming to us and believe me things were uh laughable but we got it.</sentence><sentence id="934">Uh I remember when this one thing that I always tell young people.</sentence><sentence id="935">Uh you know they knew of the Jewish holidays and there was one Yom Kippur when they marched us out and told us about the holidays and told uh that if anybody would be foolish enough to fast that that would be construed as sabotage and sabotage was punishable by death, and everybody fasted and uh we were given noodles and sugar and nobody touched it and I think you know those are the things that I think future generations should know and to me this was...and I remember then that night when we got our miserable smelling vegetables or whatever it was, there was such a feeling of sanctity, I think almost holiness, you know, and they really jumped.</sentence><sentence id="936">She tried to to see that we you know if if we didn't...everybody worked with uh uh you know al...almost with with such fervor and things that we couldn't falter.</sentence><sentence id="937">And I think that without such a oneness, such a...I saw so much nobility of spirit in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> which somehow I wish would be better recorded, you know, when people reached out, you know...somebody had a birthday so uh we would uh save...on Sunday we had margarine, a little margarine on the bread, so you know you would cut off some of the bread and scrape the margarine and and give it to the person on the bread that she would have a lot of margarine on on her piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="938">On Hanukkah, we knew it was 7 Hanukkah and that was still under Mrs. Keegler, and she was busy celebrating... Hanukkah and Christmas are together...you know, and she closed an eye to that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="939">We uh made a menorah (ph) out of potatoes and uh of course we knew that you know we couldn't light ____ but we made a menorah out of potatoes and I I still have the things which I wrote about the story about Hanukkah which we sang.</sentence><sentence id="940">I would like to translate it and give it to you.</sentence><sentence id="941">I had a wonder...if I may skip for one minute just to make a happier thing...when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the first time in 1961 I my friends surprised me.</sentence><sentence id="942">I knew of three that were in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> but actually ten showed up and I was the eleventh, and they got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, singing a song which we had written for the first Hanukkah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and we carried the menorah which I naturally have now, a beautiful old silver menorah that they give me in memory of the menorah which we made out of the potatoes, and you know when you made it out of potatoes it meant you didn't eat that night because, you know, you didn't have potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="943">You can imagine what that menorah means when my husband kindles the lights and we see our grandchild reflected in that...it's truly .</sentence><sentence id="944">Uhso you know, that was possible under Frau Keegler and one of the things that we did was Yelda and I dressed as grandmothers and you know, under the looms which we worked there was sort of a white powdery substance.</sentence><sentence id="945">We put it on our hair to grey and uh and we had a performance between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> under one naked electric light and see the faces in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="946">What we did is we started out with uh you know there were two grandmothers and everything, and comestothe -- and___ssays oh .</sentence><sentence id="947">That's how how it started out and then we of course predicted a brilliant future for everyone and then our two granddaughters came to listen to us.</sentence><sentence id="948">Strangely enough the person who played my granddaughter...her name is Hilda Steinhart Goldschmidt (ph).</sentence><sentence id="949">She lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="950">Her son was one of the heros of the Six Day War.</sentence><sentence id="951">Hilda never lived to have a grandchild and so the one who played her granddaughter did not survive and our granddaughters listened to our tale of the past and uh I'll say it in German.</sentence><sentence id="952">The <span class="DLF">exit line</span> on that was uh .</sentence><sentence id="953">Do you understand German?</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="982">Then the , because old people uh exaggerate so much and then we see them exiting.</sentence><sentence id="983">Now mind you we were eighteen years old at the time and we say to each other, .</sentence><sentence id="984">Dear children, let us just say that uh humans endure more than they think they could.</sentence><sentence id="985">And I think somehow uh considering how how young we were, we must have touched the core of our existence, the hope that someday to live in a world where our children and grandchildren would live, but best of all to live in such a climate where they will not believe our tales of the past.</sentence><sentence id="986">And that was possible under Frau Keegler.</sentence><sentence id="987">I mean she didn't exactly hear the performance, you know, and and we would sing songs in which we would say, you know, would make probably sound like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> there you know for her ears and and then we would throw in a few things in Polish, you know, which were exactly not meant for her ears, but but by and large uh that part in contrast of uh...of course you know we were fortunate, quote, unquote, that 8 we were taken early yet, you know, before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was in its full__ aspect of the...because after that people didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="988">OK.</sentence><sentence id="989">Briefly uh and finally <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landeshutz</span> was liquidated and we went to the most miserable and bitter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> (ph) in .</sentence><sentence id="990"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uh Gruenberg</span> was an enormous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="991">Uh its <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was one of the most beautiful in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in as much that it boasted the most beautiful collection of roses surrounding the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="992">It was direct

name.</sentence><sentence id="995">That was the most brutal, sadistic uh...I don't know if he was director but he was one of the people there.</sentence><sentence id="996">He wore a signet ring on his hand and and he would jump like a cat and beat his victim until blood showed, mostly beat the faces.</sentence><sentence id="997">He would have sort of a glazed look on his face.</sentence><sentence id="998">I don't know if...I tried to suppress the feeling...we called him Lalouche.</sentence><sentence id="999">He was a beast.</sentence><sentence id="1000">Uh things changed very drastically then.</sentence><sentence id="1001">I still worked in uh for a very little time in the <span class="BUILDING">weaving factories</span>, but pretty soon they had very little raw material for that and I was moved into what was considered sentence of death...spin___...spinning.</sentence><sentence id="1002">Uh we were spinning fabrics or rather threads which came from raw materials which...the raw material consisted of clothing which came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1003">It came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called .___</sentence><sentence id="1004">are hugh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> which sort of shred that.</sentence><sentence id="1005">Uh it was not difficult to imagine that some of the clothes belonged to our parents.</sentence><sentence id="1006">Uh I worked most of the time on the night shift there and I remember when whenever the the horror of some of that became overwhelming, one or at least I played a game.</sentence><sentence id="1007">I perfected it.</sentence><sentence id="1008">And that was to imagine my homecoming, with all the details being there including the sort of things that we had long sold but it was the miracle of freedom would always be there.</sentence><sentence id="1009">In any event, the most dreaded thing on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> was that...I'm not quite sure now if it was every four or every six weeks...we would go toa <span class="BUILDING">doctor's office</span> to be x-rayed because tuberculous was rampant and whoever displayed anything was immediately sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, so you had to leave some life, usually between four and six weeks...I don't remember now if it was four or six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1010">Uh there was something there with those x-rays.</sentence><sentence id="1011">I uh did a thing which I will always regret.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Uh the last day that I was with my brother, we had to go to the which was something that like the Jewish Federation, you know, when he did his registering, and we uh next to it was the ruins of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and we climbed over the debris and we sat there for a moment and one column of the <span class="DLF">eastern wall</span> stood un...undisturbed and everything else was in ruin and Arthur picked up a little stone and he handed it to me and he said just look at that column and always remember that our people will survive.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And he give me the stone, and I made a little sack of it and I carried it on my neck, and when we went to to x-rays I took it off and I had it in my pocket and I don't know...it was later probably...I think it was on the death march that I lost it.</sentence><sentence id="1014">And that was the one thing that I would...you know, pictures survived because I had them in my boot, but I lost that piece of stone.</sentence><sentence id="1015">Anyway, this was about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1016"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> was a miserable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1017">There was a lot of people being sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1018">And and then see we knew that things were going bad with the war because there were uh not bombings but we had uh sirens were blowing every so often and uh we had to stop working.</sentence><sentence id="1019">There was no electricity, and they were going crazy being vicious.</sentence><sentence id="1020">Everybody there was incredibly bad.</sentence><sentence id="1021">They made us stand <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for for hours on appell, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And uh if a piece of bread flew over the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, which it once 9 did, everybody was beaten and to say who who got it.</sentence><sentence id="1023">I'm proud to say about our people that nobody gave away the culprit.</sentence><sentence id="1024">We all knew who it was, and I think that this is that...you know, uh what has troubled me so much that I have read some of the accounts that people say how cruel people were, how they stepped on each other, or they make it sound like it was like a <span class="DLF">snake pit</span> that people __ for survival.</sentence><sentence id="1025">Look, I don't know what happened in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and this is why, you know, I have always used my maiden name on everything that I have written .</sentence><sentence id="1026">| would say that people behaved in the most incredible manner imaginable by and large.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And I think that this would be something that cannot be emphasized enough.</sentence><sentence id="1028">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gruenberg</span> that Yelda once found a raspberry in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1029">She carried it in her pocket all day long and presented it to me that night on a leaf which she plucked through the barbed wire, had washed it, and gave it to me as a present.</sentence><sentence id="1030">I asked her to take a little bit of a bite and she wouldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1031">One single raspberry.</sentence><sentence id="1032">A total possession.</sentence><sentence id="1033">She gave it to a friend.</sentence><sentence id="1034">There were other acts like that, many.</sentence><sentence id="1035">They unfortunately are not recorded.</sentence><sentence id="1036">And I think this is probably the greatest tragedy of them all.</sentence><sentence id="1037">The nobility and the love that was felt.</sentence><sentence id="1038">Anyway when things got really bad, you know, you sort of knew when things are going bad for the Germans, they're probably going to finish us.</sentence><sentence id="1039">When things are going good for for them or well for them I should say, uh they aren't going to let us go.</sentence><sentence id="1040">I know we will forever be slave, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1041">It sort of varies what is going to happen, and that became our obvious in January of 1945 where one day uh we knew...we were told we were not going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> any longer, to gather our meager belongings of whatever that was.</sentence><sentence id="1042">Uh the night between the 28th and 29th of January, with great commotion and suddenly the <span class="DLF">doors</span> opened.</sentence><sentence id="1043">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, you know...we we were then about two thousand girls.</sentence><sentence id="1044">An additional transport of two thousand came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1045">They told us they had walked for I don't know how long from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we were going to to go on a march the following morning.</sentence><sentence id="1046"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Destination</span> later on we heard <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orianienberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1047"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orianienberg</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">murder camp</span> also, small enough known near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> which fell into the hands of the Allies when General Eisenhower made his swift move on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and we started to march now to to...the death march, 29th of January.</sentence><sentence id="1048">I remember I had a terrible cold.</sentence><sentence id="1049">I was coughing terribly.</sentence><sentence id="1050">Uh we were told to assemble in four abreast.</sentence><sentence id="1051">Was Yelda, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suzie</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leisle</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1052">Leisle was probably the most beautiful girl I had ever seen.</sentence><sentence id="1053">She sort of...she moved like a deer, had hugh brown eyes, __.</sentence><sentence id="1054">She and Suzie were were sort of like sisters as Yelda was and I, you know, but the four of us together.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Lei...Leisle was from from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and Suzie was from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and Yelda and I from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> and the four of us sort of formed friendships, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1056">Leisle was the sort who looked after me.</sentence><sentence id="1057">I would say oh, it's raining today.</sentence><sentence id="1058">Do you think I should wear my green raincoat?</sentence><sentence id="1059">And she would say no, wear the navy blue one and have you been to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> to pick up apples yet.</sentence><sentence id="1060">I mean she would fall into any imaginary game and I remember that morning very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="1061">You know there's such scenes in Dr. Zhavigo (ph) when you see this incredible uh almost like a wasteland of white...it was freshly covered snow.</sentence><sentence id="1062">The snow, it had snowed during the night and the whole thing in front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in effect...it was all all covered with snow and uh we were assembled and and they lifted their whips and forward, march.</sentence><sentence id="1063">And I remember Yelda said to me, she said I don't know how you're going to make it.</sentence><sentence id="1064">We'll all make it.</sentence><sentence id="1065">And I was coughing so hard and we 0 started the first step and I remember taking that step and I remember saying to myself this is the last chapter.</sentence><sentence id="1066">But you know, I never had any doubt that we'll make it.</sentence><sentence id="1067">And Yelda was to my left, Leisle next to me and Suzie on the extreme right.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And I'm the only one left.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I think the march is documented in I'm sure many other stories. (</sentence><sentence id="1070">Pause) It was unspeakable.</sentence><sentence id="1071">I had my skiing boots.</sentence><sentence id="1072">I was the best equipped because I had my boots.</sentence><sentence id="1073">It...(pause)...at first we still had a little bit to eat that we took along and hoarded.</sentence><sentence id="1074">We marched I don't know how many miles a day.</sentence><sentence id="1075">We came to rest sometimes in in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1076">A lot of...we stopped in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called __ where blessedly a few of our girls escaped.</sentence><sentence id="1077">I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1078">Uh people were shot continuously.</sentence><sentence id="1079">If somebody stepped out of <span class="DLF">line</span>, then you would see snow being red and there through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, beautifully covered with snow and birds chirped sometimes and uh we were marching.</sentence><sentence id="1080">Everyday the number got smaller and then we came (sniffling) to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span>, Yelda was already very sick.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Leisle, Suzie and I were still going pretty strong.</sentence><sentence id="1082">One time we had nothing to eat so we started eating snow which was a terrible thing to do because the more you eat, the more thirsty you are.</sentence><sentence id="1083">And of course then diarhhrea and all was rampant.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Uh when we left one morning, one time they uh put us <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1085">They would spray us with water and then they would herd us, literally hundreds into a small ___ and everybody started to perspire, put us out again and pneumonia was just like that (snapping fingers)...people died like flies.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Then one morning we were told, for example, we were going to leave there.</sentence><sentence id="1087">| remember Yelda was frantic.</sentence><sentence id="1088">She said that's going to be the end.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I don't want to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1090">And I said if we are so much better off out in you know in the <span class="DLF">open</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1091">Maybe we'll have a better chance.</sentence><sentence id="1092">And all of a sudden came in an incredible announcement, that President Roosevelt died.</sentence><sentence id="1093">Then I knew it was too late to run because you know we reconstructed at the time was and jubilation broke out, that all the enemies of the Fuhrer will perish in such a manner.</sentence><sentence id="1094">It was a horrible blow, horrible.</sentence><sentence id="1095">But we found something that day which sort of compensated us a little for that.</sentence><sentence id="1096">We found a wrapper of margarine and there was still some little vestiges of margarine stuck to it, so we licked it dry.</sentence><sentence id="1097">We thought we'll certainly get very strong.</sentence><sentence id="1098">And things got very bad from then on.</sentence><sentence id="1099">Yelda was really very, very bad.</sentence><sentence id="1100">And one night we slept in...we all used to sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and uh it started to snow and sort of reminded me of the story, you know, there's little and went around that everybody don't sleep, get up, because if you fall asleep and it started snowing, you know, you'll never wake up.</sentence><sentence id="1101">Some people said it's the best thing we can do is fall asleep like that, and uh then one...we came to an <span class="DLF">orchard</span> and before we came to that <span class="DLF">orchard</span> sort of something incredible happened.</sentence><sentence id="1102">Oh yes...one time before that, because I thought Yelda was so sick, I said to her well we heard, you know...we saw a lot of people on the <span class="DLF">road</span> already...it was an evacuation and people were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> sort of similar to when the war started, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1103">And those people were running away from the front, and we heard somebody talking in a similar dialect, German dialect, that we had, so we concocted a whole sort of story, that we will run away in the next thing, and we will say that we, you know, will take our and we would say that we were with our mother on the on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we got lost, you know, and that we are from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beilitz</span> because we had a similar dialect and of course with names like Yelda and Gerda you know, it was...and we we really had a whole thing how we are going to do it and Leisle and and Suzie were doing something similar, and we said our father was in 1 the Wermarcht and in order to get the numbers if we felt you know , we used our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> numbers and 1939 when the war...had to make it a long number that, you know, if they asked, so they will see that we tell the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1104">And we came into that little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where we rested, and uh sort of took a signal to each other that we are going to stay there when they say everybody assembled.</sentence><sentence id="1105">And suddenly Yelda looked up at me and she said I'm afraid.</sentence><sentence id="1106">And I was going to say come on, you know...and I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1107">And when we got out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, they rounded up fourteen girls, some of our best friends were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we saw them all being shot.</sentence><sentence id="1108">Right then and there I decided no matter what happens I'm never going to run away.</sentence><sentence id="1109">I'll go to the end whatever the end is, but I'm not going to attempt to run away, you know, because we've had people already running and, you know, and uh the Gestapo, the SS was not too much in charge and, you know, it would be it would be OK, but we made a pact until then I said we're never going to run away.</sentence><sentence id="1110">We were just saved by by her not, by her saying, you know, don't run.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And we...it was either that day or the next day...I don't remember, an incredible thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="1112">People were running in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and threw bread at us.</sentence><sentence id="1113">And so we had bread and that night we rested in an <span class="DLF">orchard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1114">It was again it was snow...it started to...it was spring already.</sentence><sentence id="1115">It was April and this was after President Roosevelt's uh death...it was something like maybe the third week in April.</sentence><sentence id="1116">And uh I told Yelda to watch the bread, to hold on to it.</sentence><sentence id="1117">She was really very funny, already at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1118">And my very dear frienduh _ran away and she survived.</sentence><sentence id="1119">She's in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">That's quite a story to tell you about her...how I found, how we found each other after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1121">And uh what we didn't realize was that we had crossed over to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1122">And those were the Czech people who were throwing bread and you see, if I would have known that I would have stayed because they would have hidden us.</sentence><sentence id="1123">We would not be, you know, because if you could make it and went to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> or something, very possibly so the German farmers turned the girls over to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1124">But never in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>...the Czech people threw us things and then there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they threw something.</sentence><sentence id="1125">It landed and it was an egg, and I was sure that that egg is going to make Yelda get well.</sentence><sentence id="1126">Hadn't seen an egg in years and years.</sentence><sentence id="1127">And Yelda didn't even feel like having it.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And then one night we were again out in a meadow...snowing or raining...and a very dear friend of mine...her name is Keller...she lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>...came by and she brought two potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1129">I don't know where she found it.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And I remember I devoured mine.</sentence><sentence id="1131">I was so hungry and Yelda had the other one and Yelda said I'm not hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1132">I just couldn't believe it that she wasn't hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And she said to me you eat it.</sentence><sentence id="1134">And I said maybe she'll feel better later, so I kept it and said I'll hold it for you. (</sentence><sentence id="1135">Pause) She said she was thirsty, and I went to try to get water for her, and an SS man came and kicked her and she said why. (</sentence><sentence id="1136">Pause) And then I tried to catch some water in my hand for her. (</sentence><sentence id="1137">Pause) Then she said something incredible.</sentence><sentence id="1138">She said I'm not angry at anyone.</sentence><sentence id="1139">I hope no one is angry at me.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And then she said to me, you are going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1141">And she said if my parents survived, don't tell them how I died. (</sentence><sentence id="1142">Pause) (Crying) And then she said something else.</sentence><sentence id="1143">She said to me you have to promise me that you are going to go on for one more week.</sentence><sentence id="1144">A week was a very long time.</sentence><sentence id="1145">And she said promise.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And I said I'll try.</sentence><sentence id="1147">When daylight broke, and I had...there were some, there were some blossoms on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and I had gone earlier and I had gotten a blossom for her to smell, and I showed her the blossom...it was all dead, probably from her fever, and when 2 the sun got up, it was over for her.</sentence><sentence id="1148">And we were told to bury the dead of that night.</sentence><sentence id="1149">I couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="1150">It's strange...I know she was buried because my friend told me under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1151">I remember the most minute details and <span class="NPIP">places</span>, names of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where we went through...I still and I cannot remember the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she died.</sentence><sentence id="1152">I can't.</sentence><sentence id="1153">And sometimes I wonder perhaps it is so that that every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> sort of reminds me of her.</sentence><sentence id="1154">You know, she's become over the years my my alterego, my __ with my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And every year on the 29th of April I sort of step back and did for me some incredible things that happened on the 29th.</sentence><sentence id="1156">In the past how many years, forty-eight years...no, forty-five, forty-five years.</sentence><sentence id="1157">Forty-nine...from 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1158">I didn't see Suzie and Leisle.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I didn't know where they were because by that point I couldn't walk very well myself and I don't know now if it was a few days later, whatever, they really descended on us, and with tremendous vengeance, screaming it was all our fault because the Fuhrer is told...you know, Hitler is dead.</sentence><sentence id="1160">We felt if it was true then either they're going to kill us now or maybe we will survive.</sentence><sentence id="1161">It was uh we came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>...things were really quite crazy, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1162">A lot of people were on on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> again and uh soldiers running away and but we were still with the group.</sentence><sentence id="1163">We had one woman SS with us and a couple of men.</sentence><sentence id="1164">I don't know to to how few our group had uh...it diminished enormously from thousands to a handful, maybe a little over a hundred and I I think I was quite ill already, you know, because...I know, I mean I was ill anyway and and terrible upset about, you know, Yelda's death and uh one evening we came to rest...was a <span class="NPIP">place</span>...oh, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1165">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at that point, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1166">And and that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called which I only realized that later.</sentence><sentence id="1167">Uh we were sort of <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1168">It was quite quiet suddenly and uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came.</sentence><sentence id="1169">We were going to go some <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my friend...oh yeah, and one SS woman came and told Keller...the one who's in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>...to take off my boots.</sentence><sentence id="1170">Apparently she wanted...she saw I had good boots.</sentence><sentence id="1171">She liked my skiing boots.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And said to me, I'll come, I'll hide you, and she hid me insome___, pretended, you know, there wasn't...she never took them off.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And then _____ said to me, uh and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was going to take us someplace.</sentence><sentence id="1174">I have no idea where.</sentence><sentence id="1175">And she said you better get on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, so that she shouldn't see you.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And I suddenly said to her, you know, I really want to stay here.</sentence><sentence id="1177">I don't know what but I'm in no hurry, you know, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1178">And it sort of was a feeling that it is probably going to happen now.</sentence><sentence id="1179">They're going to kill us and I uh it was sort of at that point quite warm.</sentence><sentence id="1180">After all the snow, you know, it was a balmy night and I thought to myself it's all over.</sentence><sentence id="1181">I'm going to start thinking what it would be like for a night like that being <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, being in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> with my parents, so if they kill me that's the memory I want.</sentence><sentence id="1182">And the people, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came and some of our girls went on it.</sentence><sentence id="1183">I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1184">We waited and waited and waited but the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> did not come back and fortunately I heard that on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> uh there was one of the SS women who was pregnant apparently.</sentence><sentence id="1185">I didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="1186">And uh I don't know if they were shooting, and she was hurt and one of the SS men then turned and killed fourteen girls on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1187">Fourteen.</sentence><sentence id="1188">No, I think it was fourteen before.</sentence><sentence id="1189">You know, it's funny how how you play with numbers...fourteen or was it twenty-five.</sentence><sentence id="1190">I really don't know but a goodly number of girls.</sentence><sentence id="1191">And we stayed there and uh and they came back for us and took us into sort of a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or a <span class="DLF">hole</span> or something like that and they locked us up there.</sentence><sentence id="1192">We heard a lot of commotion.</sentence><sentence id="1193">There was uh shooting and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> 3 overhead and everything, and then the story had it uh that they uh attached a time bomb.</sentence><sentence id="1194">It was strange...we just went my husband and I to a reunion of the 5th Division Medical Corps who were our liberators and they spoke about that bomb and how the ____ was there.</sentence><sentence id="1195">I mean, you know, for a while we thought you know maybe they just threatened it was a bomb or something but apparently that was so, and they barricaded the <span class="DLF">doors</span> with chains and things and we, you know, we sort to moved.</sentence><sentence id="1196">They told that we are going to be killed and I think before that there was some shooting.</sentence><sentence id="1197">I remember some shooting was going on like it was here and there.</sentence><sentence id="1198">Nothing nothing happened...just a little skin, and uh you know, at that point I must confess that I'm not absolutely clear.</sentence><sentence id="1199">Must have been quite ill already or or whatever but I remember sort of that night it was quite turbulent and I remember them curling up and sort of uh the SS left and they left their coats and things behind and I sort of went and and tried to sleep there.</sentence><sentence id="1200">A lot of people were very ill.</sentence><sentence id="1201">We knew the Americans were coming.</sentence><sentence id="1202">I saw two the night before, and then there was the crazy night and in the morning I asked where...I asked Leisle...she was...this was the biggest irony of them all.</sentence><sentence id="1203">They were shooting from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and Suzie was hit in the foot.</sentence><sentence id="1204">Not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Suzie</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leisle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And she was lying there on the straw and I asked her where Suzie was.</sentence><sentence id="1206">It was morning and she told me that Suzie went to find some water at the <span class="DLF">pump</span> and I went to look for her and there she was, lying in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> and she was dead.</sentence><sentence id="1207">And I didn't want to go back to tell Leisle that.</sentence><sentence id="1208">So I 1 went out.</sentence><sentence id="1209">You see, I had seen...there were two Americans the night before.</sentence><sentence id="1210">I spoke to them sort of.</sentence><sentence id="1211">But that that is very vague to me.</sentence><sentence id="1212">But I remember all the things of that morning and that was after I had found Suzie and I couldn't tell Leisle so I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I stood sort of in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1213">It was a brilliant morning.</sentence><sentence id="1214">Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="1215">I have to tell you that I saw that morning on a steeple of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> a homemade white flag of peace.</sentence><sentence id="1216">And I remember that was the first time I cried in many many months.</sentence><sentence id="1217">It was a strange thing that I remember that my tears...you know, it's funny because now I cry at the slightest provocation.</sentence><sentence id="1218">I cry when I see a dog or cat or something like that but didn't cry for many years.</sentence><sentence id="1219">And uh and I was standing there and saw and all of a sudden I saw (pause) a strange <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coming down the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, no longer green, not bearing the swastika, but a white star.</sentence><sentence id="1220">It was sort of a mud-splattered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> but I've never seen a star brighter in my life and two men sort of jumped out, came running towards us and one came toward where I stood.</sentence><sentence id="1221">He was wearing battle gear.</sentence><sentence id="1222">I have to think...you know, his helmet was this mesh over that and he was wearing dark glasses and he spoke to me in German and he said, does anybody here speak German or English, and I said I speak German.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And I felt that I could tell him we are Jewish and didn't know if you would know what the star means or anything, but you know and I uh I was a little afraid to tell him that but I said to him, we are Jewish, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1224">And he didn't answer me for quite a while.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And then his own voice sort of betrayed his own emotions and he said, so am I.
