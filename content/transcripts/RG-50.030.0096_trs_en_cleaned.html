<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: At that time it was just being organized.</sentence><sentence id="86">We were the youngest group of enlisted men.</sentence><sentence id="87">The doctors were quite young.</sentence><sentence id="88">It was more like an experimental <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the Army because they used to always hire -- not hire -- but place people of 35 or older in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and save the young fellows for the infantry and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="89">So we were quite a young group in general.</sentence><sentence id="90">From there we went <span class="NPIP">overseas</span> in March.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: March of "43?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Of 1943.</sentence><sentence id="100">And ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belfast</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span>, our first stop.</sentence><sentence id="101">We were training our enlisted men for hospital duty in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and were getting acquainted with the materials that we had to use when we were on the battlefield.</sentence><sentence id="102">The training would be every day.</sentence><sentence id="103">The enlisted men would have classes and would actually practice on each other to develop their techniques.</sentence><sentence id="104">From there we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denby</span> (phonetic), which was in <span class="REGION">North Ireland</span> -- <span class="REGION">North England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="105">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denby</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- we were there again training waiting for the invasion to occur.</sentence><sentence id="106">The invasion came, of course, on the 4th of June I think it is.</sentence><sentence id="107">The exact date I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="108">But we were scheduled to go behind the Army and over to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in July, the first of July.</sentence><sentence id="109">And that's when we went across the English Channel and into the <span class="REGION">French territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">From there we were placed at first with the first Army, who was at the beachhead wiping up the remains of pockets -- the remaining pockets of Germans that were left behind.</sentence><sentence id="111">It was the policy at that time for the Army to move forward as fast as it can and not try to destroy all the Germans as we go but bypass them and let the infantry come in and finish up the work that we started.</sentence><sentence id="112">That's when we first started seeing patients in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">From there we followed to the third Army with Patton, and this was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">The first <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a <span class="DLF">beachhead</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">The second <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the base of the Brest peninsula, and the third <span class="NPIP">place</span> we went to -- and this was in a matter of less than a month or so -- was Crosan (ph.),</sentence><sentence id="116">which was a little bit north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">As I said, we were with Patton, and we were transferred to the 9th Amny at that time.</sentence><sentence id="118">And then we finally came back and went back to Patton, and we followed them clear -- one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital units</span> that followed him clear across Europe until the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="119">We were in all the major battles at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodan</span> (ph.).</sentence><sentence id="120">And then we got involved in the <span class="BUILDING">Bastogne</span>, which was where the battle of the Bulge was.</sentence><sentence id="121">We were the only <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> functioning in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulge</span> proper at the time, to our knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="122">We didn't know of any other <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="123">In fact, our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was listed as being missing because the communication was so bad during the Bulge.</sentence><sentence id="124">During that time we worked as much as 12 hours every day anyway, but I can remember that I saw 28 -- did 28 operations in those 12 hours we were so busy.</sentence><sentence id="125">As for the surgeons in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, we spent most of the time in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> doing surgery.</sentence><sentence id="126">Very little time to explore too much around the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">And we were</sentence><sentence id="129">always kept busy because we were behind Mr. Blood and Guts, Patton, and he moved fast.</sentence><sentence id="130">From there we went on and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.0248458" long="12.0971377">Regensburg</span> when the peace came, when it was declared, armistice was declared.</sentence><sentence id="131">And it moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> where we at that time started to disband the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="132">I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 19 -- in fact, I arrived back in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> New Year's of 1946.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Let's just back up a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="170">Let's trace some of the things that you commented on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="174">During that trip across the continent of Europe, we came very close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> (phonetic) I think was the name.</sentence><sentence id="175">And I was sent on a mission by the colonel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, he told me that the Germans had just left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that was based in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life.</sentence><sentence id="177">He gave me directions as to how to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">He told me it was a five-mile route, and he showed me the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">I got in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> with my driver.</sentence><sentence id="180">We went out to see what we could see.</sentence><sentence id="181">I'll tell you the story of that.</sentence><sentence id="182">It was riding through a <span class="REGION">countryside</span> which was green and very interesting in itself, and we came upon the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: How long a ride was it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: It was five miles.</sentence><sentence id="196">So I would say probably about 20 minutes.</sentence><sentence id="197">Not too much of a ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">In fact, it couldn't be too much of a ride because part of the story -- the prisoners would be paraded down the same <span class="DLF">road</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> on weekends and paraded through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where people would throw garbage and everything else on them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="203">Q: Did you have any particular thoughts on that ride out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: At the time riding out I didn't know what I was going to see.</sentence><sentence id="206">We had heard all sort of rumors of the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">We had taken care of our own soldiers who happened to be captured at the Bulge and came back to the unit after we overran the Germans, and the average -- of our own soldiers -- the average weight they would lose would be 38 pounds in a matter of two and a half months.</sentence><sentence id="208">And they would tell us the stories that they had, and we thought that was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="209">But we found out that it wasn't nearly as bad as what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">When I walked into the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, there weren't any other soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> at that time, and I felt that I was probably the first one through the <span class="DLF">gates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">The odd part about it -- the prisoners were walking around.</sentence><sentence id="212">The <span class="DLF">gates</span> were wide open.</sentence><sentence id="213">The prisoners were walking around in groups and talking, but I couldn't understand why there was no American soldiers or anybody who would guard the <span class="DLF">gates</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="214">They were wide open.</sentence><sentence id="215">Later on I found out that what had happened is that the SS troopers who were running the camp fled from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on April 11th, and the underground which was in existence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, in and about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, took over the camp with the help of the prisoners and started straightening out the camp before the American soldiers even arrived, which was a day or two later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: What did you see at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> when you pulled up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="235">A: When we pulled up, there was a big emblem on the top of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> which stated -- and the words might be not exactly right -- but it said, "You enter through the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, and you leave by the way of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span>" or <span class="DLF">chimney</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="236">Chimney" is the word they used.</sentence><sentence id="237">That was there in German in a great big emblem.</sentence><sentence id="238">It was very prominently in a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where you couldn't help from seeing the emblem.</sentence><sentence id="239">Then when you walked into the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in front of me --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: The <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: The <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open, and prisoners were walking in and out freely.</sentence><sentence id="248">No resistance.</sentence><sentence id="249">Nobody checking them or anything like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: Now, how long was that after the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="255">A: How long after the --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: Liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you go in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: The SS troopers left on April 11th.</sentence><sentence id="260">This must have been either the 13th or the 12th -- the 13th -- that I was there.</sentence><sentence id="261">I can't remember the exact date because when we were working like we did, we didn't even know what date it was sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="262">In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we didn't keep track.</sentence><sentence id="263">But it was that time.</sentence><sentence id="264">I have it on the chart.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: Did your driver stay with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="273">A: The driver was with me.</sentence><sentence id="274">It's customary that -- I was a captain at that time, and it's customary that officers didn't drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="275">We had always a driver to drive us, and he also entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: You walked in on foot?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="281">A: We drove up there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and left it outside of the first <span class="DLF">gate</span> or right inside of the first <span class="DLF">gate</span> and walked from there on.</sentence><sentence id="282">Right in front of us was three <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">Quite large.</sentence><sentence id="284">Went up about three to four <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> in height.</sentence><sentence id="285">And they were stationed one next to each other.</sentence><sentence id="286">And I remember walking up to the -- the first two you couldn't get in.</sentence><sentence id="287">They were locked.</sentence><sentence id="288">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked.</sentence><sentence id="289">There was nobody walking with me.</sentence><sentence id="290">Nobody to stop me or prevent me from doing anything I wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="291">And my purpose was to see as much as I could and try to see what this was all about.</sentence><sentence id="292">But the third <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was open, and I have taken pictures of that, which we'll probably show later on.</sentence><sentence id="293">And I had the opportunity to talk to the prisoners in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and some of the stories that I'll tell you are from what the prisoners have told me.</sentence><sentence id="294">We had a pretty good idea before I went in there from our stories that we got out of our own soldiers and the prisoners that we took about things that were happening in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but</sentence><sentence id="296">until you actually see them, it's hard to believe.</sentence><sentence id="297">In fact, when I came out of the Army, I didn't talk to anybody or even take all the things I had put in my locker and so forth that I'd brought back with me for over 46 years until now because it's nothing that you like to talk about.</sentence><sentence id="298">Besides that when you start telling the story, the people -- they look at you, and they say, oh -- they have the look that we really can't believe that.</sentence><sentence id="299">Well, the same ideas went through our head when we were looking at it.</sentence><sentence id="300">How can you believe this?</sentence><sentence id="301">After I got through visiting the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and talking to the men, they would -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> became crowded --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="325">Q: Let's back up a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="326">You were looking into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, and what did you see?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="329">A: Well, there were these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> that they had.</sentence><sentence id="330">They were about six-by-four's.</sentence><sentence id="331">And they were originally made -- and part of this comes from the prisoners themselves -- they were originally made for four people to sleep in.</sentence><sentence id="332">And there were three decks going up of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> the length of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on both sides of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">And when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> got crowded, they'd double up.</sentence><sentence id="334">And sometimes they had as many as twelve men in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that would sleep three.</sentence><sentence id="335">And the sanitary conditions were terrible, and the stories that the prisoners told is how these people would get sick and have dysentery or so and would not be able even to go to the corner of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or so -- wherever they could go -- and they couldn't even get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">So whatever they had to do they did, and from the top it just drained right down to the prisoners below.</sentence><sentence id="337">My impression at that time after I left that was that these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were probably the very last <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> the prisoner would be put in before they would be put to death in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> or other means.</sentence><sentence id="338">Many of them died from disease.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="349">Q: Were there people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="351">A: There were many people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that I spoke to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: What --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: There were at least five or six in one of my camera shots.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="357">Q: How did you speak to them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: The prisoners that were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> wouldn't give you an idea of what happened to the other two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> because they were the most recent prisoners, and they looked like they were still well fed.</sentence><sentence id="360">They were entirely different than what was remaining in the other two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, which we couldn't get in.</sentence><sentence id="361">But we know about them because we got the story back that they had to close those <span class="DLF">doors</span> because they couldn't leave these people walk around.</sentence><sentence id="362">They were infected with all sort of diseases, dysentery, and many of them were in the last stages.</sentence><sentence id="363">You couldn't do anything for them anyway.</sentence><sentence id="364">So they locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> on them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="371">Q: How did you communicate to the prisoners you talked to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="373">A: Well, that's the interesting part.</sentence><sentence id="374">It's amazing how many Germans were able to speak English.</sentence><sentence id="377">Then you find out that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> part of the school system teaches the children when they're in the third, fourth grade -- they start them on three languages -- German, French and English.</sentence><sentence id="378">And this is part of their educational system.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: How large was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when you went in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="388">A: I'm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="390">Q: How large was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when you went into them?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: It seemed they were unusually quiet.</sentence><sentence id="403">They didn't react in a normal way, and I got the feeling they were afraid that tomorrow the Americans would be driven out and the Germans would be coming back.</sentence><sentence id="404">So they sort of didn't speak too much.</sentence><sentence id="405">You practically had to force them to give you answers sometimes by talking to them and sort of getting answers from them.</sentence><sentence id="406">But that was the feeling I had because they didn't -- even when I walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they didn't even bother to look up to see who was coming.</sentence><sentence id="407">So that the feeling I had is that they all had -- frankly, one of them said that, "We don't know how long you're going to be here."</sentence><sentence id="408">They were afraid that the Germans might return, and that was the impression I received.</sentence><sentence id="409">But the funniest thing -- not the funniest but one of the most memorable parts of that particular time that I walked through these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, walked around the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- I was walking in back of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> just to see what was back there.</sentence><sentence id="410">And as I walked by, a little <span class="DLF">window</span> that probably was about one foot square or thereabouts -- I heard a voice, and I turned around and I saw a living skeleton talk to me, was talking to me, and he said, "Thank God the Americans have come."</sentence><sentence id="411">And that was a funny feeling.</sentence><sentence id="412">Did you ever talk to a skeleton that talked back?And that's what I was doing.</sentence><sentence id="413">Later on I saw mounds of these living -- I mean these skeletons that the Germans left behind them.</sentence><sentence id="414">That brings back the story that when the prisoners -- when the SS troopers left, the underground took over, as I said, and they cleaned up a lot of the things.</sentence><sentence id="415">So that didn't exist very long.</sentence><sentence id="416">When I left those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span>, which was closer to the front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, and then talked to several of the prisoners there and one in particular who had a specimen bowl that we usually use in <span class="BUILDING">labs</span> -- glass specimen bowl that was about -- oh, I'd say about ten inches high and about four inches wide.</sentence><sentence id="417">And in there was three sections of skin that had tattoos on them in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> which was saturated in a liquid of preservative.</sentence><sentence id="418">And the prisoner told me -- and he held it up for me to take a picture of -- he told me when the prisoners would first come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, they would be lined up.</sentence><sentence id="419">And the Commander's wife would walk down the <span class="DLF">line</span>, and wherever she saw anybody with a tattoo she would point to them,</sentence><sentence id="421">and that was the last they saw of the prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="422">And this is the stories from the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="423">And it just happens that what they were doing -- they would get the skin off the people, and they were making lampshades out of them.</sentence><sentence id="424">These lampshades were in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="425">I didn't have a chance to get into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> at the time, but my nurse did with other nurses.</sentence><sentence id="426">And they had witnessed about four or five lampshades that were made out of -- the top of it was made out of the skin of men with tattoos on them for them to give.</sentence><sentence id="427">One in particular was made for Goehring -- and this is from my nurse that she had seen.</sentence><sentence id="428">It was made for Goehring, and they said this was made only of the fliers that were downed in the war that they had taken these tattoos from.</sentence><sentence id="429">That was one of the things that sort of makes you feel very empty <span class="NPIP">inside</span> to think that people would be that barbaric.</sentence><sentence id="430">The Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="569">Q: Well, then you were moving along --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="571">A: Then we saw the piles of bodies next to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, some of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>, of these skeletons of the bodies.</sentence><sentence id="572">And the expressions on their faces -- what were faces -- were that of horror.</sentence><sentence id="573">You could just read probably the pain and agony they must have gone in before they died.</sentence><sentence id="574">The stories that go along with that is that they would be told to go into this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="575">And as they would turn the corner to the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> leading down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> were, they would be clubbed on the head until they were supposed to be unconscious.</sentence><sentence id="576">And then they'd roll down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and eventually be put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">If I remember right, there's about maybe 10 or 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> in a row lined up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with each <span class="DLF">door</span> in the front.</sentence><sentence id="578">That was at that time I went in they were still warm.</sentence><sentence id="579">And some of the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were open, and you could see the remains of the body.</sentence><sentence id="580">What had happened is on April the Sth the order came down to the SS troopers that they were to evacuate all Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="581">They were trying to clean up the evidence that might be left behind when the Americans came through.</sentence><sentence id="582">That was the impression I had, and I think that was probably a fact.</sentence><sentence id="583">So that the next day they started evacuating all the Jews from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="584">And then</sentence><sentence id="586">later on when I got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>, I was interested enough to look up some of the history that was in the books.</sentence><sentence id="587">In fact, just more recent than that.</sentence><sentence id="588">And I found out the reason for what was happening and how it happened.</sentence><sentence id="589">The underground was sabotaging the orders so that slowing down the evacuation of the people that were to be evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="590">And it figures in one of the write-ups, recent write-ups, there was about 25,150 people evacuated in that time that met the death penalty.</sentence><sentence id="591">If they were evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that was noted to be the entry for the termination which Hitler called the final answer to their problem.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="705">A: Not while walking.</sentence><sentence id="706">But I would stop and start a conversation at the time, and during that time they would mention some of the things that happened to the prisoners such as that when they were strapped, there wasn't only -- not strapped but when they were hit with these blows with this -- it was about a two-inch round bat if you'd call it.</sentence><sentence id="707">And it looked like it was displaying from a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> limb or so because you could still see where <span class="NPIP">places</span> from the limbs of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> would come out.</sentence><sentence id="708">It would be jagged.</sentence><sentence id="709">It wouldn't be smooth.</sentence><sentence id="710">They would say they would hit those people and sometimes let them stay there for a day or so just so other prisoners would see them.</sentence><sentence id="711">And by the end of the day that person was swollen up and disfigured tremendously, and many of them wouldn't even get off there alive.</sentence><sentence id="712">Stringing up was done the same way.</sentence><sentence id="713">They strung them up in a fashion where their hands were tied up behind them and their head was dropped down so that as a medical man you wondered how the person could survive just in breathing with the weight of the head down.</sentence><sentence id="714">Again, they would be swollen up laying in the sun for a day or so before they took them down.</sentence><sentence id="715">And those are the stories that fed back.</sentence><sentence id="716">The impression was my own as to medically what would happen with the person in that <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="717">It was a very uncomfortable <span class="NPIP">position</span> to be in.</sentence><sentence id="718">It in itself would eventually lend itself to death instead of just hanging by the neck, which is quick.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="733">Q: Did you feel the need to render any medical assistance to any of the prisoners?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="735">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="736">We -- at the time absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="737">We couldn't interfere into that.</sentence><sentence id="738">What we did do is we came -- we -- when I say "we," what I did and probably other doctors -- before I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> started filling up with other doctors or GI's coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and the MP's were at the <span class="DLF">gates</span>, started to be at the <span class="DLF">gates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="739">So I got in just ahead of that.</sentence><sentence id="740">At that time they were instructing the soldiers not to give them any of our K-ration -- which is that sweet candy bar that the soldiers would carry around in case they were on the battlefront and they needed some food.</sentence><sentence id="741">It was 100 percent energy -- with the idea that if you gave them that, they probably would die because it was too rich.</sentence><sentence id="742">And this is something we found out in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> when the post was done on some of these prisoners that we even received back from our own men that were captured only for two and a half months.</sentence><sentence id="743">Their stomachs started to</sentence><sentence id="745">1 shrink down.</sentence><sentence id="746">And instead of being a typical stomach, it shrunk down to a small -- almost to a tube-like effect, which is interesting to know because I never knew it before I saw it there that the stomach will shrink down.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="761">Q: Besides not giving them food, did you have the urge to help any of them medically?</sentence></p></dialogue>
