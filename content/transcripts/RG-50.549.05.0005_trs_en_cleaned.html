<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="43">Lived there for three weeks and then you were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span>, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kerecsend</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">And there for a few days, then from there, loaded onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, where you were separated from your parents.</sentence><sentence id="45">You worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="46">A: Not right away.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="48">Q: Not right away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="50">A: First I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> for a month.</sentence><sentence id="51">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in a lager, which was called A Lager.</sentence><sentence id="52">And two weeks after that I got in on the kitchen work.</sentence><sentence id="53">So that had to be, we were taken out in June, July, it had to be about toward the end of July.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="58">Q: In January of 1945, you were forced to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to go on a Death March towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">And you were at that point, with a group of four other girls, who you had kind of become close with, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: Do you know what became of them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="76">I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">And I don't even believe we worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other.</sentence><sentence id="78">She was older than I am.</sentence><sentence id="79">She used to be a seamstress.</sentence><sentence id="80">And in my stories, I think it's mentioned that on some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> rides, after we were already liberated, we were together.</sentence><sentence id="81">And I do know what happened to her.</sentence><sentence id="82">And she lives, she remarried.</sentence><sentence id="83">She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">And he died in the meantime.</sentence><sentence id="85">I think he was an artist.</sentence><sentence id="86">And although I never thought I want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="87">And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her address and phone number.</sentence><sentence id="88">And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">That's the first time I have seen her after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> times.</sentence><sentence id="90">And she still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">She's much older than I am, so at times I've heard that she's kind of ill.</sentence><sentence id="92">So, I don't know what she's doing.</sentence><sentence id="93">I have a feeling her husband was originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and then, you know, I think they were getting money after the Holocaust and they made their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: What was her name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rosenfeld</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bezsi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">Bezsi's like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name.</sentence><sentence id="117">That was actually her name from the first marriage.</sentence><sentence id="118">That's the way we always knew her and I do not know what her next husband's name was.</sentence><sentence id="119">So, we called her Rosenfeld, B6zsi and she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.903194" long="20.373111">Eger</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">So.</sentence><sentence id="121">And that's all.</sentence><sentence id="122">I never kept up with anybody else.</sentence><sentence id="123">I don't know what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="124">But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good.</sentence><sentence id="126">Certain things are very vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened.</sentence><sentence id="127">So, I can't give you any names.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: How did you become so close with Ilus!?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we met.</sentence><sentence id="144">And she's exactly my age and somehow we liked each other.</sentence><sentence id="145">And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were leaving, and my husband's two sisters were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but they were taken away to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="147">But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so- called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn't know exactly what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="148">We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other.</sentence><sentence id="149">And we did become good friends to the last minute.</sentence><sentence id="150">And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me.</sentence><sentence id="151">But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and <span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0005 5 therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called Death March.</sentence><sentence id="152">She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she remembered and I never remembered myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="163">Q: Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from her parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and they were... ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="165">A: Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume.</sentence><sentence id="166">But I do not recall it.</sentence><sentence id="167">Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don't even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not.</sentence><sentence id="168">So, I cannot give you any information about that.</sentence><sentence id="169">Then later she got married and they moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">And we kept up.</sentence><sentence id="171">In fact, last year I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and spent a week.</sentence><sentence id="172">So we saw each other then.</sentence><sentence id="173">And unfortunately now, she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">Have you ever been in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, yourself?</sentence><sentence id="175">And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">And she doesn't have any family anymore, because she never had any children.</sentence><sentence id="177">Her husband died years ago.</sentence><sentence id="178">She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already during <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">And she was first in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="180">Then she was in some sort of a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> situation, because | think she had a broken hip and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="181">And in that age, she's very little and fragile.</sentence><sentence id="182">And then she is now back in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">She doesn't like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write.</sentence><sentence id="184">I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot... but she's somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole situation.</sentence><sentence id="185">Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have?</sentence><sentence id="187">And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly wasn't looking forward to.</sentence><sentence id="188">That's all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: You mentioned about that time that you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, that you didn't fully believe what was happening there.</sentence><sentence id="214">And as far as... as far as your relationship with Ilus, did she believe, was she more informed than you were on that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work.</sentence><sentence id="218">Later, because I worked first in one part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, then in another <span class="NPIP">part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">And I think we met a little bit later.</sentence><sentence id="220">But I don't know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don't know whether I'm just so naive or I was so naive at the time.</sentence><sentence id="221">Because you know, I even read right now, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel.</sentence><sentence id="222">Have you read that book?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="229">Q: I actually have only read parts of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="231">A: Well, it's a very easy.</sentence><sentence id="232">And I read that just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span>, while, you know, I had a little time to read it.</sentence><sentence id="233">And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would see the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is.</sentence><sentence id="234">Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it.</sentence><sentence id="235">Well, I am either very naive... I could never have believed anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="236">We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="237">They were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> 5</sentence><sentence id="239"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0005 6 or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they would tell us.</sentence><sentence id="240">But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war.</sentence><sentence id="241">See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine.</sentence><sentence id="242">And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean.</sentence><sentence id="243">Because a lot of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back.</sentence><sentence id="244">And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="245">So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Do you think that was important for your survival that you didn't believe it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="265">A: Well, [hope so.</sentence><sentence id="266">It could be.</sentence><sentence id="267">And we didn't read about this that much, you know like I listened or read different kind of stories about people.</sentence><sentence id="268">Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> they did not know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">We did not know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">And I don't think my parents did.</sentence><sentence id="271">At the same time, my parents were very protective, too.</sentence><sentence id="272">They were the type of people that they didn't want to scare you.</sentence><sentence id="273">Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that.</sentence><sentence id="274">And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what's going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling.</sentence><sentence id="275">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were not... we did not know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="276">Like when we're in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it's going to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, because I did not know anything about that.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I am talking only about myself.</sentence><sentence id="278">You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings.</sentence><sentence id="279">We were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn't know where.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Can you tell me, can you trace in your memory, how it happened that you became aware of what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> meant?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A: I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really...?</sentence><sentence id="298">I can't remember when that came to our mind, you know.</sentence><sentence id="299">For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people.</sentence><sentence id="300">Well, I was the youngest, and I didn't have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister- in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old.</sentence><sentence id="301">Well, they wouldn't have imagined that they were burned in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">They would have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">When did we came to the realization?</sentence><sentence id="304">Toward the very end.</sentence><sentence id="305">I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe.</sentence><sentence id="306">But it wasn't that it just happened one day.</sentence><sentence id="307">And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore.</sentence><sentence id="308">It is just... everything was so gradual that I couldn't recall anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="309">And I wanted to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="310">By then, I kind of knew that I'm not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn't know what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="311">Of course, I didn't find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews.</sentence><sentence id="312">But when did that happen?</sentence><sentence id="313">I don't really know. (</sentence><sentence id="314">Doorbell rings.)</sentence><sentence id="315">Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: Well, I wondered if you got to any point where you, even if it was years after the war, where you cried for them?</sentence><sentence id="336">That it hit you or that you felt safe enough to really mourn.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="341"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0005 7</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it is, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and so many horrible things were going on, I don't remember really ever crying.</sentence><sentence id="343">You know?</sentence><sentence id="344">The shock was so great.</sentence><sentence id="345">And afterwards, see, when I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once.</sentence><sentence id="346">And so, I don't, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn't find my brothers.</sentence><sentence id="347">But it's funny, I wasn't... it's not funny at all, but I apparently didn't cry that easily.</sentence><sentence id="348">I mean I might have held it back more.</sentence><sentence id="349">And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn't... like that we go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> when we are in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>, because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids.</sentence><sentence id="350">My family's names are on it.</sentence><sentence id="351">And it's just, you know, you're just under, it's a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know?</sentence><sentence id="352">Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not.</sentence><sentence id="353">But I don't want to jump ahead of myself.</sentence><sentence id="354">You ask me the question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Okay, well I'm not concerned about sticking to a chronology, so you can talk about...We'll just get back to the chronology when...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: I don't know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough.</sentence><sentence id="371">Or maybe I was brought up in a nice <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> and I didn't have any upsetting situations.</sentence><sentence id="372">But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong.</sentence><sentence id="373">And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it.</sentence><sentence id="374">So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no.</sentence><sentence id="375">No?</sentence><sentence id="376">Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you.</sentence><sentence id="377">But maybe the feeling that you don't give up easily.</sentence><sentence id="378">Or it's like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice.</sentence><sentence id="379">Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to... then I was lucky that I didn't get really sick.</sentence><sentence id="380">I mean, that I don't think has anything to do with one's personality.</sentence><sentence id="381">You may be stronger, and I'm a pretty strong person.</sentence><sentence id="382">But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="383">And that I considered luck.</sentence><sentence id="384">I don't think that it's a personality.</sentence><sentence id="385">Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that.</sentence><sentence id="386">So I'm not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things.</sentence><sentence id="387">I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn't me.</sentence><sentence id="388">That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can't believe and can't understand how in the world somebody can survive it.</sentence><sentence id="389">And then talk about it later in life.</sentence><sentence id="390">It's...

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1800">Q: This is tape number two, side B.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1802">A: So then we... how did we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span>, your question was.</sentence><sentence id="1803">A friend of Sandy's heard about a job and he was offered that job.</sentence><sentence id="1804">It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1805">And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental psychologist, not a clinical psychologist.</sentence><sentence id="1806">And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to Sandy.</sentence><sentence id="1807">And so he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> and he applied for it.</sentence><sentence id="1808">And he got that job at the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span>, which was for one year only.</sentence><sentence id="1809">And that was kind of very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1810">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the South end, it's where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like me, even so that she found out that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1811">Now that was many years later.</sentence><sentence id="1812">And the people at the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> were very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1813">They are all older social workers or psychiatrists or psychologists.</sentence><sentence id="1814">They practically took us in like a family.</sentence><sentence id="1815">They had lot of family get-togethers.</sentence><sentence id="1816">And we didn't go out otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="1817">Because then my daughter was born, Linda was born, in 1954.</sentence><sentence id="1818">So we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> in "53 and we still lived in the South end when she was born.</sentence><sentence id="1819">And our assignment was only for one year.</sentence><sentence id="1820">And now my story is really important here, but I couldn't see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in September.</sentence><sentence id="1821">And we didn't have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little.</sentence><sentence id="1822">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at the <span class="INT_SPACE">Washington Park apartments</span> was already then eighty-two dollars and ninety-five cents or so.</sentence><sentence id="1823">We had to pay utilities, too.</sentence><sentence id="1824">So I told Sandy just anything he could do.</sentence><sentence id="1825">And by then I could walk to the <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span>, because it was right behind our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1826">I could walk, we had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, I could walk to the <span class="BUILDING">pediatrician</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1827">And I never did anything else, like go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or do that kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1828">And I said, "I wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more year, so we don't have to move just exactly in September."</sentence><sentence id="1829">Because they usually would have seminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job opportunities.</sentence><sentence id="1830">So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job.</sentence><sentence id="1831">And we would have had to move.</sentence><sentence id="1832">Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> gave him a part time job.</sentence><sentence id="1833">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norton</span> he worked part time and in one other <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> it was part time.</sentence><sentence id="1834">I mean, just very little, here and there.</sentence><sentence id="1835">Then he met two psychiatrists, who needed somebody and they became our friends, too.</sentence><sentence id="1836">And they needed somebody who would do some testing for them.</sentence><sentence id="1837">And they offered him to try and see if he would like that.</sentence><sentence id="1838">And he tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that's how we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1839">He worked with them for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people.</sentence><sentence id="1841">We're still friends.</sentence><sentence id="1842">And Linda was born in "54, so I didn't have to move away.</sentence><sentence id="1843">And then we stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> until 1957.</sentence><sentence id="1844">And we were looking for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we found this and we have been here ever since.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1888">Q: What year was that, that you moved here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1890">A: 1957.</sentence><sentence id="1891">So, from "53 to "57 we lived there.</sentence><sentence id="1892">At that time, I didn't have my fourth child, yet.</sentence><sentence id="1893">Now there is, if you have any questions about our stay here, you can ask me.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And then... but you ask me, because I don't know what you want.</sentence><sentence id="1895">25</sentence><sentence id="1897"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.05*0005 26</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1910">Q: Yeah, I read something about that.</sentence><sentence id="1911">I was wondering if you noticed segregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> and whether that, because you had mentioned earlier that it made an impression on you that black people were treated differently than whites.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1914">A: Tell me, when was the Civil Right Movement and the Martin Luther King, and when... you know I've been watching those programs all the time, but I don't remember the dates.</sentence><sentence id="1915">When was it that finally, really, for example, black people didn't have to sit on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and all that?</sentence><sentence id="1916">Do you remember dates like that?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1924">A: Because I remember the Civil Rights movements in the "60s.</sentence><sentence id="1925">I didn't, it didn't leave any special impression with me.</sentence><sentence id="1926">I didn't go anywhere much, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1927">I was very busy with the kids.</sentence><sentence id="1928">And I didn't even watch, well we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> at that time, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1929">It was later.</sentence><sentence id="1930">And when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved.</sentence><sentence id="1931">But I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do.</sentence><sentence id="1932">By then I had three kids and you know, diapers and just... I was very, very busy.</sentence><sentence id="1933">And since Sandy worked, day and very many times in the evening, he wasn't really that much of a help.</sentence><sentence id="1934">He couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="1935">In summertime we would go one vacation, we did every year.</sentence><sentence id="1936">Because his uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapolis</span>, <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and he offered for us to go there.</sentence><sentence id="1937">So, we would leave in the evening and drive all night to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapolis</span> by next day.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And we would spend two weeks there, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not.</sentence><sentence id="1939">It wasn't really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn't a luxury.</sentence><sentence id="1940">But the kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe they go on a boat ride.</sentence><sentence id="1941">But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there, than it was a really exciting vacation.</sentence><sentence id="1942">So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one was two years old, and then they sold that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1943">But no, I did not remember anything that I was that worried about that.</sentence><sentence id="1944">And when we come to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> maybe, you might like to... and I will have a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who... the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was nearby us here, where we live even now.</sentence><sentence id="1945">That's where he went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
