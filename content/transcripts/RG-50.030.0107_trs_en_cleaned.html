<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: I was very content, except I was very lonely because I had no friends.</sentence><sentence id="168">I could not have any friends.</sentence><sentence id="169">I had only my mother and my sister, who got married in the meantime so that she would have, not -- she was anyway engaged to be to be married but she wouldn't have probably that young -- she was only 17 years old that she married, or, or close to 18.</sentence><sentence id="170">She married so that she should have citizenship papers; and she married with whom she was anyway engaged, but she got engaged that young because of the circumstances that we had, that, that we had experienced.</sentence><sentence id="171">So he, he got married to a dentist who had citizenship papers and she could at least be -- live freely, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">So she left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span>, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">And I, and then I was just, I was just with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="174">But she would come to visit, to visit us.</sentence><sentence id="175">My brother would try to keep us occupied.</sentence><sentence id="176">He would bring games into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and play with us.</sentence><sentence id="177">He, he used to play, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">guitar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">He would come and play the guitar after he finished his office work; and he tried, -- he was one of the best people that, that lived on this, under the sun, because he -- not only that he, helped, he was so -- I mean, that he gave up his life for his family; but when he was a young, a young boy, he would he would take the children.</sentence><sentence id="179">And when he was even working as a dentist, whoever didn't have money he wouldn't charge.</sentence><sentence id="180">He would do free dental work.</sentence><sentence id="181">I mean, it was not just that he was helping us, but he, he'll helped other people.</sentence><sentence id="182">And what I'm trying to describe that what kind of people they, they killed; and, and that people are really not only, that could make contributions to this world and what they did to, to such wonderful people, eventually.</sentence><sentence id="183">So, so my brother tried to keep us occupied.</sentence><sentence id="184">However, he was informed by the police that in two weeks he will be taken away on forced labor, on forced labor.</sentence><sentence id="185">That meant, meant nobody knew where they are going to send him.</sentence><sentence id="186">Without him, we could not stay and continue to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horinc</span>; because we would be -- we, were stateless, so what he did is he used to send his dental work to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span> -- which was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in, deep in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">That was not from the occupation, but that was really <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">So he got in touch with the this the owner of that <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">It was a large labora-- <span class="BUILDING">dental laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">And he asked him that he could rent for us a cheap <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in some, in a secluded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">He explained him the situation, and he was a Jewish man; and he asked him that he should accept me as an apprentice to learn the dental work.</sentence><sentence id="192">He gave us all the money that, that he had to, you know, to tide us over.</sentence><sentence id="193">So, and then he left.</sentence><sentence id="194">So, you can imagine with all this, this parting -- which I described in my book -- when my, when my brother was leaving, and we never knew what's going to happen to us and we never knew what's going to happen to him.</sentence><sentence id="195">And, the, the last, day, we all -- when he came to say good- bye, my mother, my mother fainted because she couldn't -- he, he knew that.... First of all, she felt terribly guilty that we let him stay when he could be in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and now he's being taken away from us; and forced labor meant, that also you didn't know whether they will ever return.</sentence><sentence id="196">And, unfortunately, he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="197">So, but, I, I-- and, and he kept, he came three times back to, you know, to say good-bye to us and finally he had to leave; and, and this was the last time that we, we saw my brother.</sentence><sentence id="198">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span>, and we had all the, you know, we knew exactly where we are going to, to stay -- which was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by a very poor widow.</sentence><sentence id="199">It had, no hot water.</sentence><sentence id="200">It was a very dilapidated, <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, where we, were staying, and....But I was accepted by this into that <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span>; and everyday I would, I would go, you know, to learn to become a dental technician.</sentence><sentence id="201">And my mother was always at, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she tried to make a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="202">However, eventually her money was, was running out; and we, no matter how we, were trying to, to save and to live, economically, eventually our money ran out and she had to, and she was, would go to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> for, it was like, you know, like <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> and, and it was the most horrible experience for my mother, because she was a very proud person and, and she was used to help other people.</sentence><sentence id="203">I will just describe you the type of a mother my mother was.</sentence><sentence id="204">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>; and, and we, were not, by all means we, were not rich people.</sentence><sentence id="205">We, were almost poor ourselves, especial she had lost her husband.</sentence><sentence id="206">And we had -- so we rented out in order to make ends meet, we rented out to tenants; we rented out three, we had three tenants, and not even one could pay the rent.</sentence><sentence id="207">They were all poor.</sentence><sentence id="208">And we, were always, you know, we, were children.</sentence><sentence id="209">We wanted to be able also to buy ice cream and to buy chocolate and to buy nice clothes; and natural my mother never had any money.</sentence><sentence id="210">We would always tell her, "Why when you have to rent to, to people that cannot pay?</sentence><sentence id="211">Look.</sentence><sentence id="212">There are other rich people.</sentence><sentence id="213">Why don't they take them?"</sentence><sentence id="214">And my mother always said, "Let them learn from me.</sentence><sentence id="215">I don't want to learn from them."</sentence><sentence id="216">And, and she always said, "We will see that because we are doing all this good deeds, that God will help."</sentence><sentence id="217">And, and, and, anyway, she believed in God that whatever she is doing that God will reward us.</sentence><sentence id="218">She even used to send us as children to, to collect, for poor families that, that needed, that were needy families.</sentence><sentence id="219">And this is how she taught us to, to help other people.</sentence><sentence id="220">So now you can imagine that now she had to stand -- yeah, she would even cook much more than we needed and bring to those poor tenants, so that they should have enough to eat -- and now she was standing in, in a <span class="DLF">line</span> for a little soup.</sentence><sentence id="221">And she was so embarrassed about it that she would not let me -- she didn't even tell me.</sentence><sentence id="222">I didn't even know; because when I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know, the, the food was there.</sentence><sentence id="223">And I always said, "Oh, it's, it's so," you know, "it tastes so bad."</sentence><sentence id="224">So then she found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she would wash dishes to get in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, to get one meal, one meal for, for washing dishes and even this she didn't tell.</sentence><sentence id="225">She would say she brought it.</sentence><sentence id="226">He, he, there was a certain pride in the way we, were brought up, you know, that this, that it's embarrassing.</sentence><sentence id="227">And she would, she would put a pot of hot water what the landlady should think that she is cooking, in order not to let her know our dire need and in what bad circumstances we are, because this landlady didn't know that we have no papers and that we are just in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="228">And I always, and I couldn't go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> because again, in case somebody would ask me for papers, I was without papers; and everybody had to have papers in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">The policemen, they came over and they asked you for you to show your papers, and if you didn't have them you were right away arrested.</sentence><sentence id="230">So I would always go straight <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">And I was working between nine boys and they would always, you know, wanted to escort me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or to ask me to a movie; and I never wanted to go no <span class="NPIP">place</span> because, because I could not afford to be too visible in case, because I couldn't tell nobody that, that why.... The only person that knew that I am in hiding was the, owner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">laboratory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">But then one day my sister arrived from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chust</span>, and it was my -- I was -- it was my 17" birthday.</sentence><sentence id="233">She arrived on my birthday, and I was so excited.</sentence><sentence id="234">I thought that she came because it was my birthday.</sentence><sentence id="235">And she told us that my sister, the one that was --I had a sister that was married and had three children with a husband -- that they were arrested for over.... She had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, and at that time you could not just take away a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> without any reason because it was not yet you know, it, it was not yet, the Germans, the Nazis weren't, weren't yet in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">They were only in all the other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but not in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>; so they did yet have the right to go and, and take away your <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">So, so they, they paid up one, one person that wanted her <span class="BUILDING">store</span> went to the police and said that, that she over-charged.</sentence><sentence id="238">It was just a you know, something to pin on you.</sentence><sentence id="239">So they, the police came, took away my brother-in-law to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camp</span>; and my sister was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="240">And the three children remained alone, so the, from our from our tenants, they -- my -- the tenants that were in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, she left the children.</sentence><sentence id="241">He, he begged them to let to let the children that somebody should come and pick up the children.</sentence><sentence id="242">So the children were taken by, by one of our tenants until somebody from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, a cousin of hers, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jasina</span> to take care of them; and, and she moved in with her three children into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we had, you know, that, that we had went away from.</sentence><sentence id="243">So now my sister was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in a in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>;

and we never expected to see her again, because if they took somebody out, they usually killed them.</sentence><sentence id="1561">But a few days later they brought her back, and you couldn't recognize her.</sentence><sentence id="1562">They had raped her.</sentence><sentence id="1563">They, they had tortured her.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And she was completely -- she wasn't even, all there.</sentence><sentence id="1565">I'm sure she didn't know what was going on with her.</sentence><sentence id="1566">So for the next three days -- because only three days was before there was that selection -- she, for the next three days she was -- I, I was always waking her up -- she should come with us and stay between me and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="1567">When, when they were having the roll call, for roll call.</sentence><sentence id="1568">Because if she wouldn't show up, they, they would kill her.</sentence><sentence id="1569">But then three days later, there was a selection.</sentence><sentence id="1570">And they selec-- 2 she was among them selected.</sentence><sentence id="1571">From, they selected that time at least more than, more than half.</sentence><sentence id="1572">From, from the thousand maybe 600 children were, were selected, and she was among those among these girls.</sentence><sentence id="1573">And, and all of a sudden she tried to remove her to <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1574">Because if she were to ever -- it was a reflex, I'm sure, because she knew there was no chance of run-- of running out there; because it was only a more horrible death to die.</sentence><sentence id="1575">So as, as she would try, as she tried to run over the side where the girls was standing that were not selected, the SS caught her and they beat her to death with the butts of their rifles.</sentence><sentence id="1576">And the screams I couldn't forget for many years.</sentence><sentence id="1577">That why I always get this in.</sentence><sentence id="1578">I always get this in.</sentence><sentence id="1579">I, I always tell about it whenever I speak; because I always feel maybe this child had nobody left, nobody maybe survived because apparently, nobody could -- if she was there and, and she was among the children -- these were young people, then she was probably the oldest and her whole family probably was wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="1580">So I always remember this girl.</sentence><sentence id="1581">I always light a candle for her.</sentence><sentence id="1582">I wrote a poem about her, and I always tell about her.</sentence><sentence id="1583">Because her screams, as she was screaming, "Mommy, help me!"</sentence><sentence id="1584">and "God, help me!"</sentence><sentence id="1585">And I only was asking God he should -- he should take her quickly, that, that it, it should end.</sentence><sentence id="1586">Because it takes a long time to beat somebody to death, and this -- but she was not an isolated case that was beaten to death.</sentence><sentence id="1587">The, the things that we have witnessed is, is unbelievable, what human beings can do to other human beings.</sentence><sentence id="1588">Even animals have a tendency to, to kill only -- they would kill only for food.</sentence><sentence id="1589">But they killed for pleasure, they could -- they for -- they would make a sport out, out of, out of us by -- they would take, let's say, a girl, and, and have her have bricks -- she should stand with bricks in the sun, and, and do all kinds of tortures.</sentence><sentence id="1590">And I will just tell you for what two other girls were beaten to death in front of my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="1591">And that was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niirnberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1592">Yeah, you, you want -- I, I will go back first for some....</sentence></p></dialogue>
