<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="138">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="140">A: -- I've put that -- I've also blocked that out, I mean, I -- I know that, I -- I accept it, I-- now, i-if I absolutely have to talk French, I might understand some.</sentence><sentence id="141">I understand a bit.</sentence><sentence id="142">But I don't -- I mean, I -- in -- in fact, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, in Mitzpe Ramon there are a lot of French people, and I find the French very snobby about the language, so I don't -- I say, okay, I don't talk French.</sentence><sentence id="143">But [indecipherable] I can understand a little, because I studied a bit, right?</sentence><sentence id="144">When I wa -- when I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, I -- the few times that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, I was able to talk to people in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, but not to people that I know.</sentence><sentence id="145">Mental -- good mental block.</sentence><sentence id="146">But --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="154">Q: Why do you think that <span class="DLF">mental block</span>'s there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Probably there are things that I don't want to remember, I mean, that's quite clear, you know.</sentence><sentence id="157">Okay.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: But it's interesting, you know, when one has a <span class="DLF">mental block</span>, when I think about it in my own life, there are har -- there are some -- there are some parts that have been hard, and if someone were to ask me to reconstruct them, it would not be easy.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="163">I remember that they existed.</sentence><sentence id="164">I remember, let's say, a basic story about them, but not necessarily a specific within it, or certainly not a timeline.</sentence><sentence id="165">But I know that they were there, you know, I -- I was conscious when these events happened.</sentence><sentence id="166">And that's what's surprising for me is, when you're not conscious, you don't -- you just don't remember something.</sentence><sentence id="167">Then the question is -- is, is there a reason why you have no curiosity about it, or do you think you have no curiosity about it?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: [ve kind of never went too deeply into it because I just like my life, and I--I said, this is what happened, and I -- you don't go back.</sentence><sentence id="169">You don't go back.</sentence><sentence id="170">You cannot solve -- you're right, you can find out, yes, your roots, and -- and things like that, but I'm sure like there are reasons why I-I -- I do --I do a lot of sewing so I can say, oh yeah, well, my parents were also --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: In that <span class="BUILDING">profession</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="172">A: -- tailors, in that profession.</sentence><sentence id="173">I do a lot of -- I--I do artwork.</sentence><sentence id="174">I don't know whether there's a connection there.</sentence><sentence id="175">But to me that's just to go -- you can't go backwards, you can only go forwards.</sentence><sentence id="176">So that's why I don't -- I don't s --</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="180">Q: So, isn't it difficult sometimes, being with people who -- who have another need, the -- the need to go backwards?</sentence><sentence id="181">How do you -- how does that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="182">A: That's [indecipherable] had become difficult for me, that difficult perhaps for them, but not for -- I don't find it -- that it's difficult for me.</sentence><sentence id="183">I look at it, you know, it -- these are facts that you can't change, and I don't -- I don't feel that knowing more about it -- I learned now from -- from my brother, who seems to know much -- so much more.</sentence><sentence id="184">But he's a -- for instance, he doesn't remember me as part of -- in his -- in his life, and I don't remember him in that wa --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: In that early life in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A:--in--- yeah.</sentence><sentence id="187">So there's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: That was going to be one of my questions.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: Yeah, so it's -- it's --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: -- I mean, that's a--I say, okay, I mean, I've totally blocked it out, but -- and he hasn't, but there's still a lot of things that he also doesn't -- hasn't been able to relate to or to see clearly, or to understand clearly.</sentence><sentence id="192">And again, that for some -- maybe because I live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and that's -- it's a -- my life is -- is my life as it is, and without complications of my past.</sentence><sentence id="193">For me, I mean.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: When you got -- what I guess I'd like to try and trace is, when you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or even if it was earlier, even though you were a child, a young child earlier, do you remember conversations coming up, about the war, about the Holocaust, about murders?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Did your paren -- your adopted parents, what were they like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Oh, they were very good people, very nice people, very giving.</sentence><sentence id="204">I don't remember too much, if they talked very much about the war, but was -- it was always a -- it was not like -- it wasn't a hidden fact that we were adopted, we were -- it was something that we were -- we knew about.</sentence><sentence id="205">It wasn't sudden -- suddenly we learned that we were adopted, and where we came from.</sentence><sentence id="206">But I -- I think I just kind of like, you know, fit in as quickly as possible.</sentence><sentence id="207">Like for instance, learning English.</sentence><sentence id="208">I -- I believe that within about two months I was talking English, I was fluent in it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="215">Q: And do you have memories of your brother being able to, or having -- struggling with that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="217">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="220">How did your adoptive parents cross your <span class="DLF">path</span>?</sentence><sentence id="221">Do you remember --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: How did they what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: How did they cross your <span class="DLF">path</span>?</sentence><sentence id="228">Do you have memories of the first time you met them?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="230">Only through what they once -- what they -- my father told me -- both of them, that when they came to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> -- they came to visit your -- in yo -- they came to Europe and my father, who was very -- an ardent Zionist, decided that the best way to find out what the situation was, was by going to an -- a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span>, and that's how he -- I-I don't know exactly what the procedure was, but that's how he came to that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>, and he always said that he -- he saw me, and decided because they didn't have children of their own, he decided to ad -- to adopt me.</sentence><sentence id="231">And my mother at the time didn't want -- my adopted mother didn't want anything to do with it, because she was not feeling well at -- at that -- this was in deg47.And -- but he -- it was his decision, basically, and they said there's also a brother.[indecipherable] said, okay, we'll take both of them.</sentence><sentence id="232">But I don't remember the situation, I don't in -- in any way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Aside from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, what would be other early memories that you can recall?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Only -- yes --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: It doesn't have to be Holocaust related, they could be about anything, just -- just -- what -- what -- what comes to your mind?</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: Ah, there was -- okay, there was one -- as I said before, there was -- hearing children yell out something about Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: Was it a mean yelling out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: Maybe -- yeah, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="252">And, again this -- this interior decorator said to me that we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, evidently, and in order to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, we left the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and passed a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">So, perhaps that kind of -- so, for -- at that point, that explained to me why I remember something like that.</sentence><sentence id="254">The details, nothing at all, right.</sentence><sentence id="255">And there was one other thing of someone -- and again, I've never delved into it, because it's -- I don't think it's a pleasant thing to remember, about -- something about a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, and a -- interestingly enough, I had a time when I di-- I would paint a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">And someone once decided that it wou -- it showed that I-- my -- I hadn't -- that I didn't have roots, and that was why I was drawing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">And I said, fine, that's, you know, pretty clear, and understandable.</sentence><sentence id="258">But there was one thing that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mat</span> -- someone who had a lot of keys, and I think there was a name called zoo or zoe or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="259">And this could have been a dream, or it could have been something in detail, that someone was hanging from a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, that's all I remember.</sentence><sentence id="260">I mean, that's -- it was never made -- never clear, and I really don't -- I'm not all that interested to know too much about that. [</sentence><sentence id="261">indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: Was it a shadow?</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: A shadow, or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="268">Q: A shadow of a person on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, was it -- or --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: I can't even say.</sentence><sentence id="270">Just someone hanging on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, or hanging on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">Like a--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="273">It doesn't bring -- it doesn't bring up a -- a -- a pleasant image whatso -- at all.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: No, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="275">So, I put it out -- I mean, I -- it was there.</sentence><sentence id="276">When I was much younger, it would -- it would -- I would think about it now and then, but I -- I pushed it out, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="277">Q: Did you feel different than other children in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: I think only in the -- well, that's -- I think that's why I se -- I learned English very quickly, because kids in the s -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> would call me Frenchie, and I decided I didn't -- I wanted to be American, again, as quickly as I could.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="280">Q: And did you feel different than other children because you were adopted, and you knew you were adopted?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="282">A: No, I don't remember that feeling.</sentence><sentence id="283">Maybe in the first few months, or the first year, because we did go to a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> for one year.</sentence><sentence id="284">And then, when we went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span>, we would put -- we were put back a year.</sentence><sentence id="285">And I never made up that year, whereas Jack did, because it wasn't -- because I'd become friends with --</sentence><sentence id="287">with kids that were -- I was with, so, it was enough, I-I didn't need to go -- go ahead one year.</sentence><sentence id="288">So no, I don't think I felt too different.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="297">Q: Can you describe to me a little bit about -- I mean, I don't know how to express this in a way that doesn't sound much too -- too many big words.</sentence></p></dialogue>
