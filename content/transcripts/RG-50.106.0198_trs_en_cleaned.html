2012</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="184">And while we're hiding in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he escapes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and manages to get across a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> just as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi munitions train</span> was going.</sentence><sentence id="185">So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they shot him in the hand and shot his finger.</sentence><sentence id="186">And he started running away as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was coming by.</sentence><sentence id="187">And of course they did not dare fire at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there would be a massive explosion.</sentence><sentence id="188">Ok.</sentence><sentence id="189">Then while he was running this was in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, a very deep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">And he met a peasant named Mr. Borecki.</sentence><sentence id="191">And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather's diary.</sentence><sentence id="192">Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was a very big man and no shoes could fit him.</sentence><sentence id="193">So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and had him sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and gave him three breads.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="194">And my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --.</sentence><sentence id="195">He said well I'll just leave my <span class="DLF">barn door</span> open.</sentence><sentence id="196">Then if I get asked, I could say I don't know who sleeps in my <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">So my grandfather did that and the next day he left.</sentence><sentence id="198">And when he was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, oh and he was given a shovel.</sentence><sentence id="199">And in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, he was sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="200">And suddenly he heard two or three men speaking Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="201">And they had escaped an <span class="BUILDING">aktion</span>, very near this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">And one of them had a gun.</sentence><sentence id="203">And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess because he looked good on a horse.</sentence><sentence id="204">The Polish cavalry.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="205">He did.</sentence><sentence id="206">And I think that's why they took him.</sentence><sentence id="207">But anyway, so he was -- they made him the leader.</sentence><sentence id="208">They dug this <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and that's the one that I called the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">Ok, it's a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="210">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: How far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Quite a ways I think.</sentence><sentence id="213">Because this was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- now, I'Il describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in just a moment.</sentence><sentence id="214">But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two things.</sentence><sentence id="215">One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki's son had been killed by the Nazis.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="216">Because he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance.</sentence><sentence id="217">Now but before then he had told his father that the Nazis were going to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> very soon.</sentence><sentence id="218">So my grandfather knew that it was just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="219">Ok.</sentence><sentence id="220">Now I'm going to switch back and tell you about the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">Interview with Julie Keefer 8 August 9, 2012 The <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud.</sentence><sentence id="223">And there was a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to go in and as I remember it, it seemed very tall.</sentence><sentence id="224">Probably it was no more than six feet.</sentence><sentence id="225">And as you walked around, you felt this cold, wet mud.</sentence><sentence id="226">And at one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, here was the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">Then there was this cold wet mud.</sentence><sentence id="228">And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, like the kind that electric wire comes on, those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">spool tables</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">And I just, I remember it feeling splintery.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="230">And I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="231">And then again some more wet mud.</sentence><sentence id="232">Then like an <span class="DLF">archway</span> out of mud again and a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="233">On the, as you walked into that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, on the left were things that I later found out were guns.</sentence><sentence id="234">And rifles.</sentence><sentence id="235">What I, and how [I I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather smacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand.</sentence><sentence id="236">And that's when I realized those were dangerous.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="237">I don't remember the people in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">Now I'm going to switch back and tell you.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="239">Eventually there were 37 people in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis were going to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men volunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="241">Well I have to tell you that how they lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">They would raise, they would kill the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drivers</span> and take --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: They were escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: They were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">They were in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">And they would go out on raids where they would raid Nazi munitions, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, outposts.</sentence><sentence id="247">Take whatever, food, clothing, everything.</sentence><sentence id="248">Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep trying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="249">So the Nazis thought that these Jews who were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters.</sentence><sentence id="250">But they were not.</sentence><sentence id="251">Now the Banderovski didn't like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews were doctors.</sentence><sentence id="252">Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way.</sentence><sentence id="253">We'll stay out of your way kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="254">We'll leave you alone.</sentence><sentence id="255">And that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="256">Well my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son, the Nazis were going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so he got the two volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="257">They all dressed in Nazi Interview with Julie Keefer 9 August 9, 2012 uniforms, had commandeered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi jeep</span> and drove to the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="258">The two men stayed.</sentence><sentence id="259">My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, got my mother, my father, my baby sister and me out.</sentence><sentence id="260">Put us in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Mr. Borecki.</sentence><sentence id="261">Because my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother and the two girls" lives and he said of course.</sentence><sentence id="262">And so we came in the middle of the night and we were at Mr. Borecki's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father.</sentence><sentence id="263">I will not.</sentence><sentence id="264">I've already lost my mother.</sentence><sentence id="265">I'm not going to lose you.</sentence><sentence id="266">So they had no choice but all of us now went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: This is 1943.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: 1943.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Do you know what month or what season?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="297">A:I-</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: That's all right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: It probably was still winter.</sentence><sentence id="300">Because there was snow and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was still relatively safe because the Nazis could, dogs could not get the scent and stuff.</sentence><sentence id="301">So it was winter, probably.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: End of 43?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: Yes, mm hm.</sentence><sentence id="308">Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm.</sentence><sentence id="309">Then apparently and this I hear from my grandfather, my baby sister.</sentence><sentence id="310">Oh there were 37 people in that <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">My mother and my father and us.</sentence><sentence id="312">My grandfather's son, my uncle, his wife.</sentence><sentence id="313">And I think their two boys.</sentence><sentence id="314">They had two boys.</sentence><sentence id="315">My sister and I were the youngest, by far.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I guess we cried and got lice and people were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody.</sentence><sentence id="317">And my grandfather felt that he just could not do that.</sentence><sentence id="318">That his family could not endanger everybody else because everyone wanted to live and they had the right to live.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="320">Interview with Julie Keefer 10 August 9, 2012 So he decided to take us.</sentence><sentence id="321">He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket.</sentence><sentence id="322">He dressed himself as a Polish peasant and took my baby sister and me out.</sentence><sentence id="323">I guess according to my grandfather, I had blond hair and dark eyes.</sentence><sentence id="324">My sister had light hair and gray eyes.</sentence><sentence id="325">And he took us both and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">local market</span>, looking for someone named Dr. Gruen.</sentence><sentence id="326">Dr. Gruen was a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="327">I think he was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> for Catholic children.</sentence><sentence id="328">And he looked for, but he couldn't find him.</sentence><sentence id="329">And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary.</sentence><sentence id="330">He was so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn't find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was ready, he was ready to leave us in the <span class="BUILDING">market</span>, thinking somebody would find us and keep us.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="331">And keep us alive during the war.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="332">But just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor.</sentence><sentence id="333">A Polish Catholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals.</sentence><sentence id="334">And my grandfather had helped her with her horse and <span class="BUILDING">carriage business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">So she saw him and recognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard.</sentence><sentence id="336">And of course she said she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and he couldn't find Dr. Gruen.</sentence><sentence id="337">And at that point, he said could you take them.</sentence><sentence id="338">And my grandmother had had to sell her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because the people she had working for her were Jews.</sentence><sentence id="339">And they were all in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and so she couldn't make a living.</sentence><sentence id="340">So she started working as a cook for a retired engineer and his wife, the Szwarezynskis, somewhere in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="341">It must have been near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were her sister's children.</sentence><sentence id="343">Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and left their babies with her.</sentence><sentence id="344">And then she asked Mrs. Szwarezynski could she, could grandma take both.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="345">And Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me.</sentence><sentence id="346">But she couldn't take a six month old baby.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="347">So my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">And apparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="349">So grandpa had -- now remember all this time he's passing as a Polish peasant.</sentence><sentence id="350">Very big one.</sentence><sentence id="351">But the Polish peasant and because my grandfather was six, two and well over 200 pounds.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="352">He was -- just an aside.</sentence><sentence id="353">The first time I read Les Miserables, I kept thinking of my grandfather.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="354">Because remember Jean Valjean lifts a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and that's how Javert knows that he is

class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: You were telling me about your sister.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="361">A: My sister's name was changed from Tola to Antonina Noviska, which was the name of the woman who saved our lives.</sentence><sentence id="362">Lucia Noviska and that's when she was left there.</sentence><sentence id="363">And I stayed with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szwarczynskis</span> and my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="364">I have a picture, the first picture I have of me was at around that time.</sentence><sentence id="365">I was probably around two and a half at this point maybe even three.</sentence><sentence id="366">And I had been following my grandmother who was going into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to forage for whatever she could find in the way of food.</sentence><sentence id="367">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Do you remember this time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="369">A: I, again I remember --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: Flashes?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="371">A: Flashes, that's right.</sentence><sentence id="372">I remember that I wanted her to play with me.</sentence><sentence id="373">I remember that we picked dandelions together.</sentence><sentence id="374">And she made me a wreath out of dandelions.</sentence><sentence id="375">And I remember putting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep.</sentence><sentence id="376">And this I was told later.</sentence><sentence id="377">That grandma had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, thinking that I had probably gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="378">And when she didn't find me there, she was standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> waiting for me.</sentence><sentence id="379">And ready to go look for me with Mrs. Szwarczynski.</sentence><sentence id="380">And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="381">And so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told her to stay calm.</sentence><sentence id="382">And the soldier came and at that point I can't, I don't know but I woke up.</sentence><sentence id="383">And so grandma was just unbelievably relieved.</sentence><sentence id="384">And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he found me there.</sentence><sentence id="385">And I reminded him of his children back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and so he was bringing me to the closest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he was sure that's where I lived.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="386">So some kind of way later he had the picture developed and grandma got it and she took that picture, saved it and after the war.</sentence><sentence id="387">And by the way that picture is in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="388">As is a picture of my birth mother, father, uncle and two friends.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="390">Interview with Julie Keefer 12 August 9, 2012 Well anyway then we were still there with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szwarczynskis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="391">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szwarczynskis</span> had a dog.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="392">Great big huge German shepherd, really fierce watchdog.</sentence><sentence id="393">So fierce that he was not in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="394">He was kept on a chain <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> and fed with a long stick.</sentence><sentence id="395">And one day, again this I was told.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="396">One day the dog was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I went over to the dog and my grandmother was about to scream again.</sentence><sentence id="397">And Mrs. Szwarczynski kept her from yelling and I went over to the dog and petted the dog and he started licking me and we became great buddies.</sentence><sentence id="398">Now what I do remember is that when the Nazis came I was told to take the dog and go under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the dog.</sentence><sentence id="399">Now one possibility is that, that just as they said to make sure that the dog didn't remove the Nazi's leg because he had bitten a Nazi before.</sentence><sentence id="400">The other possibility, although it's fairly remote is that they suspected I was a Jewish child.</sentence><sentence id="401">But I think that's fairly remote because they were a bit anti- Semitic also.</sentence><sentence id="402">And my, there was a woman on the <span class="DLF">street</span> near where the Szwarczynskis lived who had told the Nazis that Lucia Noviska was hiding a Jewish child.</sentence><sentence id="403">So the Nazis came and took her and she was imprisoned.</sentence><sentence id="404">And tortured.</sentence><sentence id="405">And my grandfather of course found out about that and he went to Mrs. Szwarczynski and said look, you have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="406">We have to get my wife out.</sentence><sentence id="407">And Mrs. Szwarczynski was a good friend of the wife of the commandant and so Mrs.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="408">Szwarczynski went to the commandant and said you know look, to the wife and said to her, look you know the Nazis have taken my cook and I don't know what we're going to do because we need her.</sentence><sentence id="409">And she certainly is not hiding any Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="410">And the commandant's wife talked to her husband and the next thing is that the commandant came and she was released from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and told not to talk about it to anyone.</sentence><sentence id="411">And she was released and came back.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="412">Now what I remember I had -- I was in kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">I remember a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> with a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span>.</sentence><sentence id="414">And I just remember a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> that I would climb out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and into.</sentence><sentence id="415">One day I heard some noise, lots and lots of noise and the dog came.</sentence><sentence id="416">And grabbed me, some kind of way.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="417">Either I was on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span>, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="418">But the dog grabbed my clothing or grabbed me, something, and took me to the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="419">And I don't know, I don't know where this was vis a vis the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="420">I don't remember any of this.</sentence><sentence id="421">I do remember the dog taking me.</sentence><sentence id="422">And I do remember that a bomb fell on where I had been sleeping.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="423">So cause there was lots of bombing going on at that time.</sentence><sentence id="424">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="425">Q: This is what, spring of 44?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="427">Interview with Julie Keefer 13 August 9, 2012</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="428">A: This is I think not, yes, not, not, not spring yet.</sentence><sentence id="429">Probably -- like February.</sentence><sentence id="430">In April of 1944, right around my birthday my grandfather talked to my grandmother and said look I have to go back and see how everybody is doing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="431">And so I'm going to go back.</sentence><sentence id="432">So he went back to the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: And (pause, sigh) and then in 1944 in June, the Russians came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="447">And the one advantage we had with the Russians at that time was because grandpa was a survivor of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">killing camp</span>, the Russians gave him preferential treatment which meant that he could get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="448">He could get rags for clothes, that kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="449">So that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="450">And that was right around my birthday I think.</sentence><sentence id="451">And then we went to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> which is displaced persons.</sentence><sentence id="452">But I like to think of it as delayed pilgrims.</sentence><sentence id="453">Yes so very delayed.</sentence><sentence id="454">So then --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="455">Q: Do you remember the time of leaving where you were living --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: [remember the first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="457">Q: Well that's, do you remember your leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence><sentence id="458">Do you remember that at all?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="459">A: Of the, but when the dog took me --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="460">Q: No, after the Russians were coming you left.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="461">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="462">I don't remember that, Mm, mm.</sentence><sentence id="463">Mm, mm.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="465">Interview with Julie Keefer 14 August 9, 2012</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="466">Q: So you're gone.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="467">A: My grandfather in between had been trying to locate Dr. Gruen's <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

her husband Uncle Jake, was a little taller than she.</sentence><sentence id="936">Huge, beak like nose, but Uncle Jake almost never spoke.</sentence><sentence id="937">He was like a

id="945">And they were supposed to move to an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the other side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> but it wasn't ready.</sentence><sentence id="946">So they were staying with Tante Siegel.</sentence><sentence id="947">Had to pull out something.</sentence><sentence id="948">So to say there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="949">So the Joint wouldn't let me live there.</sentence><sentence id="950">And, but I loved going there.</sentence><sentence id="951">And I heard from my cousin Sid, many years later he had given me a huge teddy bear which he had won at a fair and he was going to give it to their first child.</sentence><sentence id="952">But he said, you looked so sad and needy there that I thought maybe I better give it to you.</sentence><sentence id="953">So he gave it to me.</sentence><sentence id="954">And I, very imaginative child, named this teddy bear, Louka, which means doll in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="955">But oh I loved that teddy bear.</sentence><sentence id="956">And that was a happy time.</sentence><sentence id="957">And Tante Siegel would have a yummy brunch every Sunday with white fish and sable, and lox and bagels and cheeses and tomatoes and all kinds of yummy stuff, always milchig.</sentence><sentence id="958">And I would be doing dishes and I inevitably used the wrong dish towel.</sentence><sentence id="959">And we had to go find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that had any dirt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="960">But that was a challenge.</sentence><sentence id="961">So that was Tante Siegel.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="962">I remember once Aunt Rosa who always looked unbelievably chic.</sentence><sentence id="963">She had a black chignon.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="964">I'm sure she died her hair but she was very regal looking, in contrast to her sister Aunt Helen who always looked bedraggled and harried.</sentence><sentence id="965">In shapeless <span

<span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="968">And one day she took me out for lunch and to buy me a new skirt.</sentence><sentence id="969">And the skirt, I remember was gray but it was kind of full, had big pockets with blue trim on the pocket, the top part of the pocket.</sentence><sentence id="970">And I thought it was gorgeous.</sentence><sentence id="971">And I wore it back to Aunt Helen's and I remember her yelling in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where Aunt Helen was yelling and saying why did you take that brat?</sentence><sentence id="972">Why didn't you take Perry?</sentence><sentence id="973">She deserves it.</sentence><sentence id="974">That brat doesn't deserve anything.</sentence><sentence id="975">I don't know what Isaac and that woman were thinking of.</sentence><sentence id="976">And I decided that I wouldn't wear the skirt by Aunt Helen because all it did was get Tante Rosa in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="977">So I would only wear it at <span class="BUILDING">Tante Siegel's</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="978">Well, one day I remembered, I was still a bit of a ring leader and Perry was very, very shy and I remember saying to Perry, let's go visit Yeta's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, Elaine, at that time she was called Elaine's</sentence></p><p><sentence id="979">Interview with Julie Keefer 24 August 9,

id="981">And they all smelled so good.</sentence><sentence id="982">So I remember that was just a whole new world.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="983">Yeta was a -- Elaine wasn't thrilled that these two younger went to her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but I think she forgave us eventually but I remember that was so pretty.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="984">I just remember Aunt Helen saying that well if you're good I'll show you a picture of your grandpa when, in his soldier uniform which I had never seen him so I was -- I tried to be so good.</sentence><sentence id="985">And I was never quite good enough.</sentence><sentence id="986">So I never did see that picture.</sentence><sentence id="987">And I guess I must have been there for eight or nine months.</sentence><sentence id="988">And it was a very, very difficult time.</sentence><sentence id="989">Probably for everyone.</sentence><sentence id="990">But I remember it being very difficult for me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="991">And I remember the social worker from the <span class="BUILDING">Joint</span> coming.</sentence><sentence id="992">The first time and I was warned that I was to tell her that I was being treated beautifully and that I was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="993">And the second time she came, I didn't care and I told her I hate it here.</sentence><sentence

pretty awful person and ugh.</sentence><sentence id="997">Um.</sentence><sentence id="998">The social worker said Julie, we're going to send you to the <span

great.</sentence><sentence id="1001">I didn't want to leave Tante Siegel cause I adored her.</sentence><sentence id="1002">So that was pretty sad, leaving her.</sentence><sentence id="1003">But I -- someone put me in a pretty new pink dress.</sentence><sentence id="1004">And I remember it had belts that tied in the back, with some flowers on it.</sentence><sentence id="1005">I was eight years old
