was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far away, where from time to time people were summoned for various reasons, and there was always a great deal of trepidation and fear

away.</sentence><sentence id="1384">It was called Auga(ph).</sentence><sentence id="1385">And so, the typical day was just, go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> or go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and eat and sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1386">Were a lot of bedbugs, that was a terrible pest, and other than that I can't really remember that much, except big discussions <span class="NPIP">inside</span> with my -- I had one of my cousins was already 15 years old, and he had been quite a good student before the war, and he knew quite a bit of history, and his sort of view of the situation was that we'll never get out of there.</sentence><sentence id="1387">This is where the Russians send their political enemies, have done so during Tsar's time and have done so, you know, during the purges, and are doing it now.</sentence><sentence id="1388">And none of these people ever get out.</sentence><sentence id="1389">And of course my view of history was limited, but I do remember arguments because my mother particularly said you can't take that kind of point of view, and it doesn't have necessary to be like that, and we will get out, it's different.</sentence><sentence id="1390">There's a war and they will be defeated at some point, and things will change.</sentence><sentence id="1391">Anyway, those discussions I do remember, and I remember him saying there's a Polish saying that these are dreams of a severed head.</sentence><sentence id="1392">So, whenever my mother would hold out these optimistic speeches, he</sentence><sentence id="1394">Interview with Riane Gruss 8 January 5, 1996 would say, these are dreams of a severed head.</sentence><sentence id="1395">So that's what I remember from

father in over a year and a half or whatever it was, and it -- and that was very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="1839">And then we went upstairs and they talked and talked and talked and

your arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwew</span> and your -- you and your mother and your brother seeing your father for the first time.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1843">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1844">And -- and the reason he didn't come to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> was because --my uncle and he had decided that it was very important to prepare her slowly, but since the distance from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was very short, so even</sentence><sentence id="1846">the slow preparation was not really slow enough, and the impact was enormous and she fainted and carried on, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1847">And then we went upstairs and I re -- I just remember that they talked and talked and talked and talked.</sentence><sentence id="1848">And that was -- that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1849">And then we found out that my father had -- well, he had his own set of, you know, what he went through, but the reason we were set free was because they -- a relative here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had bought in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, or gotten in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, Bolivian passports which were actually -- they were almost genuine, they were not completely false.</sentence><sentence id="1850">They were issued by the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">Bolivian consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span>, which -- they were not issued by the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1851">They had booklets and they had stamps and the consuls very often did it for their own gain.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And so -- but they were more legitimate than the ones who were later prod -- you know, manufactured right -- right then in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and wherever.</sentence><sentence id="1853">So, anyhow, he had gotten the -- these Bolivian passports, and my father, while he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and he ha-- was moved during the 18 months he was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, he was moved to 11 different <span class="BUILDING">jails</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1854">They move people constantly.</sentence><sentence id="1855">And the interrogations started from -- from the beginning in each particular <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1856">My father never knew whether it was because they didn't have records, or whether it was a purposeful thing to exhaust people.</sentence><sentence id="1857">Interrogations were always at night he told us, and the first few <span class="BUILDING">jails</span> he was treated terribly, and he really suffered hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1858">And later -- and he, on the other hand, did something different which worked out well.</sentence><sentence id="1859">He convinced</sentence><sentence id="1861">Interview with Riane Gruss * January 5, 1996 them that he was actually more important than he was.</sentence><sentence id="1862">He tried -- he did not play the [indecipherable] because he thought that it wouldn't work anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1863">He was a very imposing, good-looking, tall man, and he spoke five languages fluently, was educated in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1864">And so he was a personality.</sentence><sentence id="1865">And he was afraid that if he tried to tell them that -- who he wasn't, they would find out who he was, and then that would be worse.</sentence><sentence id="1866">So he sort of even -- he told them who he was, and he told them that he had very good connections abroad.</sentence><sentence id="1867">He did do some dealings with <span class="BUILDING">Lehman Brothers</span> here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, he had some dealings with Bernard Baruch, he did do that.</sentence><sentence id="1868">Probably not as much as he told them, but -- and they felt maybe that it was worth saving him and sending him abroad.</sentence><sentence id="1869">And so when he -- they told my father that if he wanted to contact his -- his relatives and ask them to help him by sending in foreign papers, they would release him, and that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1870">But we didn't know anything about that in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, so when these passports arrived, they notif-- they called my father one -- by then he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Lubyanka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1871">At the end, the last three or four months he was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Lubyanka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1872">By the way, it's a very luxurious <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1873">He had a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> he told us, with Persian rugs, and they treated him like a king.</sentence><sentence id="1874">Wonderful food, he went out for a walk every day.</sentence><sentence id="1875">Those were the people -- you never knew in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> what was going to happen -- those were the people that they subsequently probably released.</sentence><sentence id="1876">Anyhow, to make a long story short, he said that they notified him one day that the passports had</sentence><sentence id="1878">64 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 arrived, and he would be able to leave whenever he felt like it.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And at that point, he said he wasn't going to leave until he found out what happened to us.</sentence><sentence id="1880">Took them three months to locate us.</sentence><sentence id="1881">And three months later, I forgot to say, the first time they called my mother, they asked her to give them a picture of herself and the two children, and they didn't say why.</sentence><sentence id="1882">And that picture took them a long time to send it from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, and it actually came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lubyanka</span> and the -- the inspector showed it to my father and said, is this your wife?</sentence><sentence id="1883">We found her, we know now where she is.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And that's when they told us to go back, or sent us back.</sentence><sentence id="1885">So there was some rhyme and reason to it, and that's when -- and -- and they released him, or he left on hi -- of his own free will.</sentence><sentence id="1886">He was -- when -- when they told him that we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1887">So that's how we were reunited, and we had now these Bolivian passports.</sentence><sentence id="1888">And we were supposed to leave on the 24" of June, 1941, and we were supposed to go all the way east again, via <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and to go to, presumably <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> at some point.</sentence><sentence id="1889">But the 22"4 of June, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and so we never made it.</sentence><sentence id="1890">We had everything, we -- we had the train tickets, we were packed, we had everything.</sentence><sentence id="1891">So that was a very bad break for us because we -- the da -- the Russians evacuated very efficiently.</sentence><sentence id="1892">I mean, they -- they left, and they didn't take anyone with them.</sentence><sentence id="1893">We tried to ask them to take us with them, but there was no way, they weren't going to take any civilians at all, and they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And so we -- we stayed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwew</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And I remember we</sentence><sentence id="1897">65 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> at night, because they were shooting and bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1898">Not bombing so much, but shooting.</sentence><sentence id="1899">There was a war.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And during the night, I remember there was this marching at night, this very, very strong marching, and my mother said, the Russians are gone, these are the Germans, and I remember say -- sort of -- I always thought that she knew too much before anyone else did, she -- and sometimes she was wrong, but very -- most of the time she was right.</sentence><sentence id="1901">And I said, how do you know?</sentence><sentence id="1902">And she said, because they march differently.</sentence><sentence id="1903">And sure was she right, they marched differently.</sentence><sentence id="1904">And in the morning, there they were.</sentence><sentence id="1905">And so that was the hard -- that was hard, because we were lucky in the way that we had the Bolivian passports, so we did not -- we were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1906">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> was established very, very quickly, because they already had experience from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and all that, so they -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lw6w</span> it went very, very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1907">And we couldn't go out, because they were rounding up children in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, they were rounding up people, they were rounding -- you know, and they had these ratzias as they called them, they rounded up people, so my parents didn't -- th-th-they were afraid to let us out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> because -- or themselves, for that matter, because they knew that these Bolivian passports -- you know, they -- they were safe -- th-there was talk that the -- we would be exchanged for prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1908">As you know, these talks went on and on and some people were sent, and actually -- I don't know if anyone was actually exchanged, but some people</sentence><sentence id="1910">Interview with Riane Gruss degdeg January 5, 1996 were deported and told that they would be held, and would be exchanged.</sentence><sentence id="1911">These foreigners.</sentence><sentence id="1912">Some people really had real foreign passports because the husband was --had left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before and sent the passport, was living already in -- in one of the <span class="REGION">South American countries</span>, and so on, and the wife was supposed to follow.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And so there were some real legitimate ones.</sentence><sentence id="1914">Ours were not a hundred percent legitimate, but that didn't make that much difference.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1992">A: Scary.</sentence><sentence id="1993">Very, very scary, because they looked superhuman, they looked like gods, and I --I often had the -- the feeling that maybe if we would look like they did, or be dressed like they did, and have these shiny boots that they had, then maybe we -- they wouldn't hate us so much.</sentence><sentence id="1994">In other words, I remember strongly feeling that they were superior.</sentence><sentence id="1995">I believed they were superior at that time, they did -- they -- they -- they look mighty and -- and superhuman.</sentence><sentence id="1996">So I -- I was just afraid of them, but not -- but at the same time I thought they were great, you know, they were the -- they were -- they were awesome, that's what they were.</sentence><sentence id="1997">I remember reading one of Elie Wiesel's early books, and -- where he talks about the same -- that he had sometimes the same sort of feeling, that if he looked -- you know, if he could look like them, they wouldn't hate us so much.</sentence><sentence id="1998">So apparently children did have that kind of fantasy.</sentence><sentence id="1999">So I do remember that.</sentence><sentence id="2000">I remember being very afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2001">I remember -- you asked me about relationships and so on, I remember my parents</sentence><sentence id="2003">Interview with Riane Gruss *" January 5, 1996 at that point fighting all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2004">A lot of tension, a lot of fighting, because the fights were always about what to do and what not to do.</sentence><sentence id="2005">And my mother -- my father was a very law abiding sort of straight kind of person, and he thought if he lay low with his Bolivian passports, things would blow over.</sentence><sentence id="2006">If he followed whatever directions, or whatever ordinances they passed, and so on, then he would be all right, because you don't -- you don't do anything to somebody who's a law abiding citizen.</sentence><sentence id="2007">My mother had totally different ideas.</sentence><sentence id="2008">My mother felt that we would never survive if we just stayed there, and we have to do something, and there was this constant fighting about who was going to be guilty of us being killed and who wasn't, and who -- you know, this was [indecipherable] this was, and it was really constant.</sentence><sentence id="2009">So I remember th-that part of it.</sentence><sentence id="2010">After a few -- after -- we were a year with the Germans in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwo6w</span>, but after the first two or three months, my parents too -- sent my brother and me to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, because by coincidence, the chauffeur that they employed before the war, his wife's family came from that part of -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and they had -- they were farmers, they had a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, they were peasants.</sentence><sentence id="2011">And so he was able to find that out, he -- or I guess my father did, and they paid them, and then my brother and I stayed there for about two or three months --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2012">Q: Was it hard --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2013">A: -- or four months.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2017">68 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2018">Q: -- hard for you to leave --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2019">A: No-</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2020">Q: -- your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2021">A: --no, I was so happy to leave, because it was safe, you know, it was quiet.</sentence><sentence id="2022">And it was -- it felt safe, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2023">Q: But even leaving your mother, wasn't it hard at that young age?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2024">A: No, no I don't think it was hard, because I don't remember it as being hard, I remember thinking that -- that this was going to be quiet and safe, and that -- and they also told us that it would be -- we were a burden.</sentence><sentence id="2025">They -- they made it very clear to us that we were a burden, because we -- ye -- they could hide with grown- ups, they -- subsequently they were hidden by a German officer in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2026">And wi-- they couldn't do that sort of thing with us children around, so we knew that we had -- that we were a kind of burden, and we had to be taken care of somewhere else.</sentence><sentence id="2027">So, I know it wasn't bad, and these people were nice to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>

what the grown-ups were talking about, and it wasn't very cheerful, either.</sentence><sentence id="2047">No, that was hard.</sentence><sentence id="2048">You didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, you did nothing, you did absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2049">One memory, vivid memory I actually have from -- actually this happened before the Germans came, because they -- we were there for two or three months before, and I had very, very bad teeth.</sentence><sentence id="2050">I suppose because of the result of this year in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and I needed fillings, and those were my permanent teeth, and they were -- had enormous cavities in them, and I -- oh, knitting.</sentence><sentence id="2051">My mother taught me how to knit and how to darn, and I did a lot of that because that was something to do all day long.</sentence><sentence id="2052">So I had this knitting needle, and I could put it right through my front teeth, they were s -- and I was supposed to go to the dentist, they had no -- and you know, there were dentists [indecipherable] anyhow, they had no Novocain.</sentence><sentence id="2053">So, to do that, they had to strap me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and -- to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, which was, to this day when I go to a dentist, I have a terrible time.</sentence><sentence id="2054">But anyway -- and my parents were having one of their fights about what to do.</sentence><sentence id="2055">And I remember staying -- staying in my -- [had like a little <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span> where my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was, and it was early in the morning, and I was supposed to go to the dentist that day, and I remember say- saying to myself whether I should volunteer and say if they stopped fighting, then</sentence><sentence id="2057">I would go without crying and objecting, and I never made it.</sentence><sentence id="2058">I was so afraid of this dentist and the strap and the pain, that I didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="2059">I let them fight on, because I couldn't bring myself to do that, to make that supreme sacrifice.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2060">Anyway, aft -- so then we went out and we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2061">There I remember digging potatoes, which was great fun, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="2062">And then they made fires, and they roasted the potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="2063">I remember Christmas there, where we baked a -- there we had something to do.</sentence><sentence id="2064">That was, you see, the difference.</sentence><sentence id="2065">I didn't -- we didn't go out, because they didn't want us to see the other farmers, and we didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and we didn't -- because they all went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday, but we didn't, we were actually hidden.</sentence><sentence id="2066">So we only stayed on -- in the <span class="DLF">field</span> near to their <span

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">partition</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="2148">I wasn't there, so I don't know, but my -- but that's what they told me.</sentence><sentence id="2149">And you see, and that's why it was important to get us out of the way, because you couldn't hide us together like that.</sentence><sentence id="2150">And then -- then my par --</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2153">you see, my parents at some point realized that they would never survive, or that they would be deported with the Bolivian passport, that the Bolivian passports would not save them from deportations.</sentence><sentence id="2154">And you see, there, there was a big difference of opinion between my parents, because my father believed that we would be exchanged, and my mother said no way, this is all -- you know, they" Il never exchange anybody for anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2155">And they" ll just take us like everybody else, and kill us.</sentence><sentence id="2156">So the -- in the end they made the decision that we would go illegally across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2157">And -- which was a very risky business, but apparently they came to the conclusion that it would be less risky than staying with these Bolivian passports in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2158">My uncle had gone before.</sentence><sentence id="2159">He went before because he was -- he didn't have any foreign passport, and he was what they dec -- what they designated as a necessary Jew, because he helped -- just like he helped the Russians to identify what they were robbing, he then did the same for the Germans, because they were -- they were robbing things, and they had these <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> where they stored them, and they had to decide what to take to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, what to send to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, what not to send to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, what to steal, what not to steal for themselves, and so on, so they needed experts to tell them what's good and what isn't, you know, like in every other <span class="REGION">area</span>, you know, what is a good painting, what is a good <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carpet</span>, what is good <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">china</span>, what is good silver, what is -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2160">So my uncle got, since he had that kind of job with the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2163">75 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 Russians, he stayed on and they took over this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>, and so he stayed with them.</sentence><sentence id="2164">And he became -- my uncle was a very charismatic person and became very friendly with the guy who ran this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2165">And so first he had like a certificate as a notwendig Jude, you know one of these Jews who were necessary for the German Reich.</sentence><sentence id="2166">And then he was arrested twice and badly beaten and both times this German was able to get him out on the -- saying that he was a necessary person.</sentence><sentence id="2167">But my uncle realized that this is not going to work a third time, besides he suffered terribly, was terribly beaten.</sentence><sentence id="2168">And so he decided to -- to take -- to run -- to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and then we followed.</sentence><sentence id="2169">And I remember that crossing of the <span class="DLF">border</span>, because that was a terrible experience, because you see, they kept saying, my parents kept saying -- I guess they -- they knew about it and they didn't try to hide it.</sentence><sentence id="2170">Many of these guys, they were paid and then they took people directly to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">police outpost</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2171">And there was no way you could pretend, I remember being totally, totally defenseless against that, because you were in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and you had to cross -- you didn't cross on a <span class="DLF">road</span>, you crossed like on <span class="DLF">trails</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2172">And you had to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, there's a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2173">So -- and they were the guides, they -- they were local people who knew how to -- how to get there.</sentence><sentence id="2174">And -- but if they turned left or right or straight, and -- and took you somewhere else, there was no way you could have prevented it, or -- or even know.</sentence><sentence id="2175">And that's what happened to many people.</sentence><sentence id="2176">So I knew about that,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2180">76 Interview with Riane Gruss January 5, 1996 and I -- I don't know how I knew about it, because probably my parents talked about it and -- and I remember being terribly afraid that they would deliver us.</sentence><sentence id="2181">So -- but we didn't -- they were -- they didn't, and -- or he didn't, was one guy.</sentence><sentence id="2182">And what I remember about that is that when we were crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, there was a strong sort of current, and there were like big rocks and it was slippery, and my father fell, or slipped and lost his glasses.</sentence><sentence id="2183">And that was a major problem, and he got terribly upset because he couldn't see without his glasses, he was very nearsight.</sentence><sentence id="2184">And so I went next to him, or I sort of went back and I started looking for the glasses and I found them, they were caught behind the -- and he talked about this as long as he lived, about these -- that I found his glasses and that saved whatever it saved.</sentence><sentence id="2185">But the effect of all of this was that we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span>, and we -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> was the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">metropolis</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2186">And we arrived in the morning early, and we were -- my father was wet, and he was in a suit, and he was wet from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2187">And it wasn't so much that it was uncomfortable, it was in August, so it wasn't cold, but as -- as they said late -- it was dangerous, you know?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2188">Why would these people be dressed like that and wet and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, in the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2189">We went to a <span class="DLF">park</span>, because that was the -- the most logical <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be.</sentence><sentence id="2190">And what my father -- what my parents with great bitterness recalled for years and years was that -- see, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> had not been occupied yet, and the Hungarian Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span> was a very Jewish place, they were living there a normal</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2193">Interview with Riane Gruss u January 5, 1996 life, and my parents told -- you know, approached a couple of people, my father did, and told them of -- you know, that we had just escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and would they help us.</sentence><sentence id="2194">And nobody wanted to help us.</sentence><sentence id="2195">Nobody.</sentence><sentence id="2196">And it wasn't even -- that's what my parent were so bitter about, because it was -- later on, you understood if somebody didn't help you, or the Poles, for that matter, if they didn't help you during the occupation, because they would be severely punished.</sentence><sentence id="2197">But at that point in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> there was no real danger yet of being severely punished, and yet they wanted no part.</sentence><sentence id="2198">And we later -- I read about it later a little, I think they thought if they had nothing to do wi-with us, then the evil, and all this problem that's coming from the east, somehow wouldn't come to them.</sentence><sentence id="2199">You know, but my parents were very bitter about it, I don't know enough about it.</sentence><sentence id="2200">But finally somebody did take us in, and I remember that it was on the outskirts, and it was a-- was not a Jewish family, some -- some woman in the square told us to follow her, and she took us, and she had a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2201">And she told us we could stay in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2202">So we dried out in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and she brought us some food.</sentence><sentence id="2203">And in the meantime, my father had some sort of a meeting point with -- because my uncle went ahead, and my uncle was supposed to arrange for Christian papers with a fake name for us.</sentence><sentence id="2204">You see, we couldn't show up as the same people with the same passports in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2205">You see, we had to then reinvent, and I -- ourselves and the new identity.</sentence><sentence id="2206">So th-the idea was that in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> we would be</sentence><sentence id="2208">Interview with Riane Gruss % January 5, 1996 as Polish Christians, which -- of whom there were many because there were some deserters from before the war, from the beginning of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2209">And there was a colony of Polish people there.</sentence><sentence id="2210">So these papers came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munkacs</span>, and my father got them someplace, and they came with a man with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, who my uncle arranged would take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> already with those papers.</sentence><sentence id="2211">And those papers, that I ha --remember one of the most frightening moments of my war was that my mother told us that from now on my name, or -- for me, and my brother too, my name was, since I was always called Ria(ph), that my name was Maria, and the last name was Wolinsky(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2212">Our name before the war was Wohl.</sentence><sentence id="2213">So the simplest thing, they dropped the H and made it into a very nice Polish name, which was Wolinsky(ph), so my name was Maria Wolinsky(ph), or Wolinska(ph) for that matter.</sentence><sentence id="2214">And my brother was Stefan always, so there was no problem, was Stefan Wolinsky(ph) and my father was Athol(ph) and my mother was Gisele.</sentence><sentence id="2215">But, when we were -- you see, the - Munkacs in that <span class="REGION">area</span> was still the <span class="DLF">border</span>, it was the <span class="DLF">border strip</span> what they called, and then there was a post, a police post that you had to pass.</sentence><sentence id="2216">And there they stopped all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and looked and -- and you had to identify yourself, or whatever, identification.</sentence><sentence id="2217">And at that point, when they stopped us, my mind went blank.</sentence><sentence id="2218">I suddenly could not remember whether our name now was Wolinsky(ph) or Wolsky(ph), which are very similar.</sentence><sentence id="2219">And I was -- and how I didn't die of a heart attack, although children don't usually, but I was trembling</sentence><sentence id="2221">and I was petrified.</sentence><sentence id="2222">And this guard spoke to the driver, of course and the driver -- they spoke Hungarian, we couldn't understand a word.</sentence><sentence id="2223">And they -- he told them that we were some relatives or something.</sentence><sentence id="2224">I mean, it never came to us -- to our having -- it was all bribe -- the -- to identify ourselves, but I thought that it might, and I was sure that they would ask me my name, this was very important at that point, and I was very scared.</sentence><sentence id="2225">And as soon as we started moving again, I said to my mother, I forgot what our name is.</sentence><sentence id="2226">And she -- and I was -- you know, I- I saw myself also as being the -- the one who caused everyone to be whatever -- so, killed or -- or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2227">So my mother said then, don't worry, she said, if you -- if they had asked you for your name, we would have been lost anyway, no matter what they would have s -- what they would have -- what you would have said.</sentence><sentence id="2228">So -- but it was just, to show you how these things were.</sentence><sentence id="2229">So then we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> we stayed in a pensionne.</sentence><sentence id="2230">And we could not stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, it was sort of in the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, but life was good.</sentence><sentence id="2231">You had plenty of food, we had comfortable <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2232">Apparently life was enormously cheap in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2233">And my father went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>

things we knew backwards and forwards in -- in Polish, quite, quite well.</sentence><sentence id="2359">We were not questioned about that.</sentence><sentence id="2360">So then they released us and we went back to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but they told us that we couldn't stay there, because it was too close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778"

hour by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leanyfalu</span>, and that was sort of a concentration of Polish refugees.</sentence><sentence id="2368">We rented a

the <span class="REGION">area</span> was liberated, we heard that most of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> was liberated, and the conditions in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>

remember is that that was a very difficult, miserable walk.</sentence><sentence id="3502">And then we got to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and they had been liberated for a few days also, and they were still in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, because most people s -- remained there.</sentence><sentence id="3503">There was no pl -- mu -- many of the <span

these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> kept leaking, and they were filling up with water.</sentence><sentence id="3534">So it took us hours and hours, because we were going from one <span

yelling.</sentence><sentence id="3537">And it turned out that the reason there -- they had survived, the reason the list -- they were not on that list was because the list was of people who were still there, who had survived were -- and were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3538">And my parents, because they were there only mainly because of being hidden there, the minute the Russians occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span>, they left and went to some friends" <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3539">We knew where to look

what we were told to do, and there were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">containers</span> and we took the water.</sentence><sentence id="3552">Maybe the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">containers</span> were not that big, maybe they had small and bigger <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">containers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3553">I don't remember that, but I do remember doing it,

that.</sentence><sentence id="3559">And I do remember when we didn't see their names on that list; it was horrifying, and we were crying and we were screaming and I--my uncle said, you know, let -- you know, don't cry, and everything will -- will be all right, and let me ask and see what happened, and so on, so forth.</sentence><sentence id="3560">So then we went <span class="NPIP">inside</span>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4054">A: So, they were not allowed to use in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> after the war, any of the German textbooks, which meant that everything was dictated to us.</sentence><sentence id="4055">And it was so cold in the ca -- in the classrooms, that we had to have gloves on to -- to -- to write, and it was very difficult, I remember that was very difficult, and it was difficult for me to write dictation, because also my German wasn't that good.</sentence><sentence id="4056">But I did somehow, but the main reason why we weren't -- why I was, I don't remember if my bro -- I think my brother also must have gone, was that we got food, that we got the soup, that was the main reason to be there, because I don't remember learning a whole lot there.</sentence><sentence id="4057">And then afterwards, one day a man came to us, and told me -- introduced himself and told me that my parents said that he should bring me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4058">And he didn't have a piece of paper, anything written, and I was a little bit leery of going with him, because my parents said that I had to wait until I heard from them, you know, that I had -- that was my -- my assignment.</sentence><sentence id="4059">And I -- and -- but he convinced me.</sentence><sentence id="4060">And I must have been very lonely, because I was happy to go.</sentence><sentence id="4061">And I went, and I -- the -- he -- and I later found out that he was doing what most people</sentence><sentence id="4063">142 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 were doing then, smuggling.</sentence><sentence id="4064">And my parents -- he knew my parents and they asked him if he would bring me back, because by then my parents had the Brazilian visas.</sentence><sentence id="4065">We knew we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4066">At least they knew, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="4067">And they needed me to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4068">And they asked him, because they knew he was doing that, he was going back and forth, had he had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4069">But he told them that he wouldn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for me, and s -- that he wouldn't be able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="4070">And that's why they never gave him a piece of paper to -- to te -- a letter for me, that I was supposed to come.</sentence><sentence id="4071">So -- but then he found that he had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.

nice man, he was quiet.</sentence><sentence id="4173">What I do remember is that I, for the first time, I found about Jewish things, because my grandfather ate kosher, and so did my

as</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4178">145 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 to exactly why, but I remember that he was a very nice man, and my aunt was very nice, and again, my concerns were different.</sentence><sentence id="4179">They were there, it was crowded.</sentence><sentence id="4180">My parents slept -- this was a -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> of a cousin of my father's, and he -- this cousin had imports of watches, he was an importer of watches from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, and -- before the war.</sentence><sentence id="4181">And so I remember my parents had a war -- it was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span>, a -- or a gr -- big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span>, not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span>, a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> that was put down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and they slept on that.</sentence><sentence id="4182">So you know, it was crowded in there, and then my grandfather was there and my brother, and we slept -- I think we slept on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> that were put together.</sentence><sentence id="4183">It was not very comfortable, there was -- so I don't -- you know, it wasn't like you were happy to see your grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="4184">In a way it was almost -- he had -- he occupied the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that was there, so it wasn't so wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="4185">And then, a little while later, we were ready to leave, and we left.</sentence><sentence id="4186">We left by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028"

ruined.</sentence><sentence id="4191">But I wasn't very impressed, because again, by then it was a little cleaned up already, and it -- while it was very destroyed, I was not exactly at an age where I could appreciate it, that these wonderful <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="4192">And it was nothing compared with what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> looked like.</sentence><sentence id="4193">I mean, I knew what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that's destroyed is a few hours</sentence><sentence id="4195">146 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 after, that's very different.</sentence><sentence id="4196">So I wasn't -- that didn't make any impression on me.</sentence><sentence id="4197">As far as <span class="BUILDING">Jewish memorials</span>, we never went to any of them.</sentence><sentence id="4198">My parents -- you know, as far as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, or the site of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4199">No, I think this is an [indecipherable] that is now very -- you know, people do it and I'm going to say something that's going to shock everybody, but I think that -- I myself feel that there's -- when we really needed help and support right after the war, and when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and -- and, you know, I had a need to talk about what happened to us, in order to inform people I had close contact with, schoolmates and so on, nobody was interested.</sentence><sentence id="4200">Nobody was interested.</sentence><sentence id="4201">And now, I almost think it's too much, and I myself am almost overdosed on the Holocaust, particularly on the superficial de -- characteristics of it.</sentence><sentence id="4202">I still very much like to read books on the ho -- that have something to do with the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="4203">Not memor -- not memoirs, you know, what happened to another person who had a similar story like mine, I think on that level it's not interesting.</sentence><sentence id="4204">But novels or fiction or anything that deals with the Holocaust, I will read, and I find some of them very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="4205">But this sort of obsession with it now is, I think way overboard, you know, way, way too much.</sentence><sentence id="4206">And not all of it's sincere anyway.</sentence><sentence id="4207">So anyhow, we did -- I don't remember doing anything Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4208">After the war, my mother was very gratified, because my parents did ask us after the war whether we wanted to stay Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4209">And both my brother and I apparently said</sentence><sentence id="4211">147 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 yes.</sentence><sentence id="4212">I don't remember it v -- I do remember talking about it, but it wasn't a long discussion, it was more -- don't forget, we had these Christian papers.</sentence><sentence id="4213">We had an option to stay who we were during the war.</sentence><sentence id="4214">You -- you did have some -- you had a possibility, and some people did.</sentence><sentence id="4215">They just didn't want to have anything to do with it any more.</sentence><sentence id="4216">They didn't want their children to have to go through this, what we went through, and so there were all kinds of different solutions, let's say, or -- or -- or <span class="DLF">roads</span> to recovery that people opted for.</sentence><sentence id="4217">Options.</sentence><sentence id="4218">So I -- they asked us, and we decided that we wanted to -- at least we said that we wanted to stay Jewish, and the reason was not -- I was too young, I mean I didn't know anything, I never studied anything, neither did my brother, that I-I just felt that -- that we were born, that is like, do I want to be a blonde?</sentence><sentence id="4219">No, because I was never a blonde, and there was no reason to now become a blonde.</sentence><sentence id="4220">So now that it's over, yes, so we said yes.</sentence><sentence id="4221">But it wasn't such a big deal as it is today in general again, you know being Jewish was not what I always tell my husband, a full-time occupation.</sentence><sentence id="4222">It was just something you were, that's all.</sentence><sentence id="4223">So, after the war, we had back our names and our -- you know, legitimate birth certificates and the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="4224">And we went via -- we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4225">In <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I think -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> we had to wait a long time, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> for about three months.</sentence><sentence id="4226">We didn't get to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> til October, so we must have been there -- not three months, maybe a little shorter,</sentence><sentence id="4228">148 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 because the trip took about four or five weeks on the -- on a <span

was the one that was cleaning it up.</sentence><sentence id="4382">So that was not a happy thing, but I didn't know that it was that until many years later.</sentence><sentence id="4383">And then she

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4434">A: I didn't know anything about it, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="4435">I knew it was a hot climate.</sentence><sentence id="4436">I knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rio</span>, its capital, and that's where we were going, was supposed to be a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4437">And also I knew that we knew a number of people there; that I knew.</sentence><sentence id="4438">And also my father, not only that -- that his former partner was there, but also my father was married before, so my mother was his second wife, and he had two daughters by his first wife, and the older one, with her husband and son, were in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>; that was another reason why we went there.</sentence><sentence id="4439">And my nephew, her son, was only two and a half years younger than I am, and a year younger than my brother.</sentence><sentence id="4440">So I knew that -- that there was some sort of family.</sentence><sentence id="4441">My father never had a very good relationship with her before or after the war, but that's a different story.</sentence><sentence id="4442">But anyhow, I knew they were there.</sentence><sentence id="4443">And what did it mean?</sentence><sentence id="4444">It meant a certain, imagine, permanence, but not a happy one.</sentence><sentence id="4445">Not -- not for me.</sentence><sentence id="4446">I had -- I had -- I was open to it, but my mother was very unhappy, she didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>, so there was a lot of problems for -- about that, because my mother really wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4447">And she made it very clear when my uncle left, she wanted to do it.</sentence><sentence id="4448">My father didn't want to take the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4451">155 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 chance, and of course, she couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="4452">But she felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> was really a very, very, very, you know, contrary, different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and she felt very strongly that she had nothing in common with that culture, and talked a lot about it.</sentence><sentence id="4453">I remember that I, for myself, felt that she was exaggerating, that she was making it -- being negative, and I didn't want to be negative at that point.</sentence><sentence id="4454">My father also -- my father was a very positive, but my father was the kind of man who, how shall I say?</sentence><sentence id="4455">If he decided to do something, he would -- he -- he didn't have second thoughts, he would make an effort to make it work.</sentence><sentence id="4456">And she was a much more kind of intuitive and emotional person.</sentence><sentence id="4457">Anyhow, she felt that after surviving the war, there was really nothing for in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4458">It was a strange <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, a <span class="REGION">tropical country</span>, she kept saying it was a <span class="REGION">tropical country</span>, a strange <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and it really made no sense to go there, and she was very unhappy about it.</sentence><sentence id="4459">And when they argued about it, th-the interesting thing was that she used to say that my brother, who was much more -- you know, was younger and much more sort of very different, less settled than I was at that -- you -- she used to warn my father and say, you na -- he's going to get used to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and you see, he" ll end up marrying out of

id="4465">156 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4466">A: She used to talk a lot about it, because to her, what we went through, the war, was very much alive, and to me also.</sentence><sentence id="4467">And she used to talk a lot about it, more in relation to what was expecting us.</sentence><sentence id="4468">Her attitude was, we went through so much, and is this what we went it through for?</sentence><sentence id="4469">And so she would bring things up, and -- over and over.</sentence><sentence id="4470">I can't say that I was sitting there patiently talking about it, because my attitude was more like my father's.</sentence><sentence id="4471">We're coming here, it's -- it's -- it's --I didn't want it to be that negative because I didn't -- I didn't worry about my fa -- my brother marrying out of faith, I mean I -- you know, I had other problem, I had other --I thought she was exaggerating, I thought, you know, let's give this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> first a --a chance, and then see maybe it will be a nice <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4472">Who knows?</sentence><sentence id="4473">Why say in advance that it won't be?</sentence><sentence id="4474">And so yes, she talked a lot about what -- what we -- we had gone through, and so on, yes.</sentence><sentence id="4475">But how much I did of that, I probably listened.</sentence><sentence id="4476">And some of the stories -- she, by the way, was a great, as I mentioned probably earlier, she was a great storyteller and she was amusing and -- and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4477">And she was interesting, so I probably, you know, if she had some reminiscences of something that I didn't remember so well, or that was amusing to her, and at the time I was too young to understand, yes, I -- she did talk about it, and I did listen to that, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4547">A: And so we were invited there for dinner, and we went.</sentence><sentence id="4548">And of course, during the -- first of all, the dinner was so unbelievably elaborate and beautiful, and butlers in white gloves serving and candle lights on the thing.</sentence><sentence id="4549">I'd never seen anything -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, candle lights, silver, porcelain.</sentence><sentence id="4550">I mean, it was really, even by my today standards, it -- it would still be very impressive because people don't live that way in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with, you know, we had practically two servants per person at this dinner.</sentence><sentence id="4551">So anyway, during that dinner, of course, the conversation was about what we went through, you know, what happened wi -- to us during the war and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4552">And at the end tu -- my parents sort of told the story.</sentence><sentence id="4553">I, of course, at age 14 was very, very quiet and I didn't say anything, my brother didn't say anything because we just sat there and -- and were stunned by the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="4554">And when she finished telling</sentence><sentence id="4556">Interview with Riane Gruss " March 1, 1999 what happened to us, our hostess said -- she said, oh my God, she said, this is nothi -- what you went through is nothing compared what we suffered not knowing where you were and what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="4557">And I said to my mother -- this I remember -- when we left that evening, I said to my mother, I'm never going to talk about what happened to us to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="4558">They don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="4559">They don't -- it's no use, beca -- and I really did do that, I did not talk to people what happened.</sentence><sentence id="4560">And later on, when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I should then tell you how and where and so on, I also found that as a result of what happened to us, or to me, I had very little rapport with youngsters my age, very, very little.</sentence><sentence id="4561">Because I always felt that whatever interested them was so -- today I would use the word superficial, it wasn't superficial, it was -- they were real teenagers, and they were interested in clothes and lipstick.</sentence><sentence id="4562">Again, in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> this was very -- still is a primary concern of a teenage girl.</sentence><sentence id="4563">And -- and I became later on, a little interested in that, but it wasn't like -- you know, I had so many other things that happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="4564">But they wouldn't understand, so I didn't have -- I didn't have a lot in common with them.</sentence><sentence id="4565">That was a big problem for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4606">Q: How did the teachers at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> treat you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4608">A: I should really backtrack and tell you about my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> experience, because I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> at the age of 14, and basically had no <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> about 10 months in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, in first grade.</sentence><sentence id="4609">I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after that again, after the war, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> for about six weeks or two months.</sentence><sentence id="4610">I was taught by this lady, this Polish lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and by my mother, so I la -- that's how, at some point I learned how to read and write.</sentence><sentence id="4611">Probably in first grade, but that was in Russian.</sentence><sentence id="4612">And just before they deported us, I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about two months or so, because I remember making <span class="DLF">lines</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span> of As and Bs, that's how they taught at that time.</sentence><sentence id="4613">So that was in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="4614">So basically I had never really been in</sentence><sentence id="4616">161 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 <span class="BUILDING">school</span> properly.</sentence><sentence id="4617">So here I was, and I was 14 years old, and I needed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4618">So my parents found out, and I found out that the Brazilian system is exactly like the French system.</sentence><sentence id="4619">Which means that you have to -- they cannot put you any higher than sixth grade, because you don't earn credits, you have to work towards the baccal -- baccalaureate, or wa -- how you spell it, how you pronounce it, and they wouldn't take me above the sixth grade.</sentence><sentence id="4620">They were willing to take me into the sixth grade, and then I would learn Portuguese, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4621">So anyway, I had to learn Portuguese.</sentence><sentence id="4622">This, to me, was like part of the war.</sentence><sentence id="4623">It was a terrible disappointment, because here I was, I was 14 years old.</sentence><sentence id="4624">To go into the sixth grade was so humiliating.</sentence><sentence id="4625">And I was also very tall, I was as tall as I am today, or if not taller, cause I've begun to shrink.</sentence><sentence id="4626">But -- so this was a terrible, terrible blow to me, and there was nothing you could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="4627">So someone told me, and that was my lifesaver, that there's an <span class="BUILDING">American school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4628">And the <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> does let you earn credits, and it only counts from the ninth grade.</sentence><sentence id="4629">I was the right age for the ninth grade, so if they would let me start in the ninth grade, then I had a chance to -- to be with people my own age, and graduate on time.</sentence><sentence id="4630">Problem was that I didn't know any English at all, just like I didn't know any Portuguese.</sentence><sentence id="4631">So, I-- of course, my parents were convinced that it was six of one, half a dozen of the other, I did have to learn a new language, and that wasn't the problem.</sentence><sentence id="4632">And I must say that I went with -- I had to go with somebody who</sentence><sentence id="4634">162 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 would interpret for me.</sentence><sentence id="4635">So I went with my half-sister, she spoke excellent English, she -- she was at the <span class="BUILDING">interpreters" school</span> in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> before the war, her English was excellent.</sentence><sentence id="4636">And she went with me.</sentence><sentence id="4637">And we spoke -- we got an appointment, we went there and they told me that if I learned English between October, end of a -- now it's November already, middle of November, and March, because the school year in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> begins in -- on the first of March.</sentence><sentence id="4638">The long vacation because of the summer season is in the -- is in the winter.</sentence><sentence id="4639">So, they would give me some sort of an exam, that would have a little bit of social studies, they gave me some -- they gave me a textbook.</sentence><sentence id="4640">General science, a little mathematics.</sentence><sentence id="4641">So basically sort of a-- some kind of foundation.</sentence><sentence id="4642">And some English and if I could pass that exam at the end of the summer, over there, by March first, they would let me cu -- go into ninth grade.</sentence><sentence id="4643">Now, when I took th -- I studied like crazy from that day on until March first.</sentence><sentence id="4644">And then my mother used to say that was -- we had an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armchair</span> -- oh, eventually we moved, we got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4645">We had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armchair</span> that she used to say she could have sent easily to take that exam, because an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armchair</span> was so saturated with my sitting in there and studying.</sentence><sentence id="4646">I studied from morni-- morning to night, I had a dictionary.</sentence><sentence id="4647">I had no lessons, nobody helped me, really.</sentence><sentence id="4648">My sister occasionally helped me a little, but I really did it by myself with a dictionary, and my father knew a little English and somehow -- and the <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> was</sentence><sentence id="4650">163 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 unbelievable, they were so supportive, they really were.</sentence><sentence id="4651">And when I was taking that exam, they gave me a dictionary, they let me use a dictionary.</sentence><sentence id="4652">And in -- and the only funny experience I had with that was that my mathematics was quite good, I was always good in math.</sentence><sentence id="4653">And -- but one of the examples on that exam had to do with dimes, nickels and quarters.</sentence><sentence id="4654">And of course, there I had no idea what that was, and I had to leave that question out, but it was the only one I left out, so I did very well.</sentence><sentence id="4655">And I started ninth grade at th -- and I was thrilled, and I worked very hard, and I did very well.</sentence><sentence id="4656">And I graduated from -- from the <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> when I was 18, four years later.</sentence><sentence id="4657">And that's what brought me to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, because the <span class="BUILDING">American school</span> did not have rights in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span>, so I could not have gone on to -- to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> or anything.</sentence><sentence id="4658">So that fa -- and I did want to leave, but it was because of that I really had to leave, unless I-- I could have gone to a <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> and become a secretary, and there was some talk of doing that, but I didn't want to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4912">Q: And how did you meet your husband?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4914">A: Oh, that's actually a cute story.</sentence><sentence id="4915">He -- my father was a banker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> before the war, and my f- late father-in-law was in the banking business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwew</span> in <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4916">And so they had done some business together.</sentence><sentence id="4917">They were not friends, but -- because they were living in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and it was a little bit -- they</sentence><sentence id="4919">Interview with Riane Gruss m March 1, 1999 were different.</sentence><sentence id="4920">But they had done some business together, and my late father-in-law found out from some -- some Polish people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> that -- who were neighbors of his actually, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where he lived, was a family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakew</span> who knew my parents, and found out that I was here by myself, studying.</sentence><sentence id="4921">So he called me on night and said, my name is Oskar Gruss, and he -- he was -- said, I knew your father, and I would like to -- you to come for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="4922">Now, I had gotten quite a number of invitations like that, because many people knew my parents -- well, my father, before the war.</sentence><sentence id="4923">And if-- they heard that I was alone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, so they would invite me.</sentence><sentence id="4924">And most of these ee -- dinners were deadly boring, terrible.</sentence><sentence id="4925">So -- and most of the names of the people who invited me, prior to this call, I had heard about at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you know, the -- they -- but this name I had never heard, so I decided that I wasn't going to go there for dinner, and rush -- he wanted me to come Friday night.</sentence><sentence id="4926">I said, I'm sorry, Friday night I can't.</sentence><sentence id="4927">So he said, when can you?</sentence><sentence id="4928">So I said, Monday in two weeks, because I figured out -- it took a week -- it took five days actually, to write -- to write a letter <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and get an answer, so that would be 10 days.</sentence><sentence id="4929">So it gave me over two weeks to find out who this person was.</sentence><sentence id="4930">So he said Monday in two weeks, okay.</sentence><sentence id="4931">And he said, we eat early, and -- so be there at 6:30.</sentence><sentence id="4932">All right, so I said goodbye and I said I would be.</sentence><sentence id="4933">And in the meantime I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my parents, and I said such an Oskar Gruss called me, invited me for dinner, shall I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4936">172 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 go?</sentence><sentence id="4937">Who is it?</sentence><sentence id="4938">So I got back an answer sure enough, and my father wrote that there was such a person, he was in the banking business, he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span>, and he remembers him, you know, vaguely, not terribly, but -- and that if I have nothing better to do on that Monday evening, I can go, I should go.</sentence><sentence id="4939">So I decided to go.</sentence><sentence id="4940">So I went and I got there at 6:30 sharp and I-- my mother-in-law -- my future mother-in- law opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I saw this blank thing -- he completely forgot to tell her.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4941">But she caught on quite quickly, he mu -- they must have talked about me, because once I stood there -- first I saw this blank stare, and then she -- she sort of caught on who I was.</sentence><sentence id="4942">I introduced myself, and she was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="4943">And then I saw the maid setting another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so obviously everybody had forgotten about me.</sentence><sentence id="4944">And then I sat -- and she was very nice to me, and we sat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> and she actually asked me a lot about what we had gone through, and wha -- where was I and what was I doing, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="4945">So, about half an hour later, the key turns in the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and in comes my father-in-law first, and my future husband behind him.</sentence><sentence id="4946">And my father-in-law sort of went with his head, oh my God, he said, cause he remembered he for -- that he forgot completely that I was coming.</sentence><sentence id="4947">Anyhow, then we sat down to dinner, and dinner was a disaster, because my husband had a sister who's no longer alive, and she was studying -- oh, she was in third year law school, I think.</sentence><sentence id="4948">And they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wall Street</span>, and the conversation, even though I knew English, seemed to me that I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4951">173 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 didn't understand one word, didn't know what they were talking about.</sentence><sentence id="4952">And so that was dinner, and then right after dinner, we got up and my future husband said, I'm very sorry, but I have an appointment, and he got up and he left.</sentence><sentence id="4953">And I said to myself, I'm going to wait 20 minutes, because I was told someone doesn't get up from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and leave.</sentence><sentence id="4954">But this was horrible, so I said to myself, I'll wait 20 minutes and then I'm leaving.</sentence><sentence id="4955">So, during those 20 minutes, we sat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> and my father-in-law also sat with us, my mother-in-law talked some more.</sentence><sentence id="4956">And she was very nice, I liked her.</sentence><sentence id="4957">And she -- and my husband came back before those 20 minutes were up.</sentence><sentence id="4958">| later found out that he did have a business appointment on Broadway, not far from where they lived, at the <span class="BUILDING">Schrafft's</span>, they used to meet there at that time, and he had no way of contacting this person, so he ran over, told him I can't be with you tonight, and came back, brought me <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4959">So that was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="4960">That was very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="4961">Then I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my parents that -- described the dinner, more or less, in the way -- and there was one other detail that I omitted.</sentence><sentence id="4962">My parents-in-law had the large collection of Jewish paintings, you know, as they s -- they just now actually was -- part of it went to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4963">But they were all Oppenheimers(ph) and Kaufmans, so they were these Jewish heads.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4964">And all these <span class="NPIP">things</span> were staring down at me.</sentence><sentence id="4965">And my father-in-law and my future husband, this was a Monday night, were sitting in kippot.</sentence><sentence id="4966">I had never seen that in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4969">174 Interview with Riane Gruss March 1, 1999 my life.</sentence><sentence id="4970">So I was a little bit taken by that, you know, it was such a different kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I'd never seen anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="4971">So that was a little strange.</sentence><sentence id="4972">So anyhow, I wrote to my <span class="BUILDING">parents home</span> about this whole evening, and I got a letter back from my father saying, in the year 1930, with a question mark, I remember sending him a present for his Bar Mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="4973">Why isn't he married yet?</sentence><sentence id="4974">So anyway, so that's how I met my husband.</sentence><sentence id="4975">We started going out, he started taking me out.</sentence><sentence id="4976">This was in February, so it was about a year after I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4977">And I went and -- we went out from February til -- til June.</sentence><sentence id="4978">June I was going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for my vacation, because my s-school year was over.</sentence><sentence id="4979">And I -- he took me -- he told me -- he brought me a little radio, I remember, he brought me a present, the -- the -- just before I was leaving, and he said to me, I'm very sorry, I won't be able to take you to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to see you off -- I was traveling by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> -- because he said, it's a holiday.</sentence><sentence id="4980">And I said, a holiday?</sentence><sentence id="4981">Well, it turned out it was Shavuot, which was a holiday I never even heard about.</sentence><sentence id="4982">So at that point I found out that he's observant.</sentence><sentence id="4983">He kept it from me, from -- from February until June, he took me out -- I didn't realize that he was ordering fish, because I didn't really care what he was ordering.</sentence><sentence id="4984">But we went out a lot, and I didn't realize that he was religious.</sentence><sentence id="4985">Never asked me out on a Friday, but you know, th-that was -- I didn't think about it.</sentence><sentence id="4986">So when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rio</span>, he came for the Fourth
