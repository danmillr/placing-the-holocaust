<body><dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1">granted.</sentence><sentence id="2">My friends were Polish, Ukrainian, Jewish, and I really even though you're not asking me, I never felt any anti-Semitism in my childhood.</sentence><sentence id="3">There probably was some but I never felt it personally.</sentence><sentence id="4">And when I think of it now it was probably no small achievement that my father was a professor at a <span class="BUILDING">state university</span> as a Jew and to me it was a given.</sentence><sentence id="5">That's the way it went on.</sentence><sentence id="6">My mother did an awful lot of philanthropic work in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I remember they organized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the summer time for needy children, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian and there was always an awful lot of activity and it was a very happy <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="7">I mean there were many things.</sentence><sentence id="8">You talk about being a tomboy.</sentence><sentence id="9">I was the bane of my sister's existence.</sentence><sentence id="10">She was four years older and I always wanted to do what she did.</sentence><sentence id="11">Of course she resented it.</sentence><sentence id="12">One time we had they call it a fretepian so it's not really a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> I guess but something like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">salon</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="13">One time I got hold of some paint and I painted the keys.</sentence><sentence id="14">I was punished for that but I did it so she wouldn't be able to play.</sentence><sentence id="15">Those are the things I remember from my childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="32">Q: How large was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> approximately?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="34">A: Twenty, thirty thousand, just about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: So it was a good size <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">It wasn't a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="40">A: It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, yeah, but it was a very typical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> as they call it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="42">Q: Was there a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="44">A: Yes very large and very active, large, I don't know probably several thousand Jews and there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> they called *Tarbut and there was a society, I guess, the Kahila that governed the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="45">There were several different <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">There was a rabbi and that's it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="50">Q: Were your parents religious?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="52">A: They were traditional but they were quote emancipated unquote.</sentence><sentence id="53">They were not very religious, they were traditional.</sentence><sentence id="54">I knew who I was, I knew my identity.</sentence><sentence id="55">We observed all the holidays and that's another thing I remember.</sentence><sentence id="56">Once before Passover I was given a little Star of David and a gold chain and I lost the Star of David and there were about twenty people at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and this is like a big dinner at Passover and everybody was made to crawl on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to find my little Star of David which they found.</sentence><sentence id="57">But I don't remember going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="58">No, we didn't do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="66">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about -- you know as much as you can remember -- about the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the Germans in 1939?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="68">A: Well before the Germans invaded my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> the Soviet Union took over because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was partitioned in two.</sentence><sentence id="69">The eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became the property of the Soviet Union and we fell into that category.</sentence><sentence id="70">So in 1939 when the war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came in.</sentence><sentence id="71">They came in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and with their soldiers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="76">Q: Did they come in on the first or did they come in a few weeks later?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: They came in maybe a week or so later and I remember long, long processions.</sentence><sentence id="80">At that time we lived in a big, big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the main fashionable <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">Litsa Miskawicha and I remember long hordes of refugees coming from the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> trying to get away from the Germans and we didn't understand what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="82">They came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and with soldiers but very little bloodshed.</sentence><sentence id="83">There was a lot of chaos but pretty soon things became again sort of normal.</sentence><sentence id="84">I personally did not realize what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="85">I knew there was a change of government.</sentence><sentence id="86">The emphasis in my life was that the language, the formal language became Russian instead of Polish.</sentence><sentence id="87">But again that was not much of a problem because in our <span class="REGION">area</span> everyone was either bi or tri-lingual.</sentence><sentence id="88">It was a little difficult in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="89">A lot of people lost their jobs and all.</sentence><sentence id="90">My father did not.</sentence><sentence id="91">They kept him on and he continued in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">There was one change which I just realized a few days ago.</sentence><sentence id="93">He used to also teach in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kracow</span>, I don't what do you call it, as a visiting professor and that stopped.</sentence><sentence id="94">Well it stopped obviously because the Germans took over.</sentence><sentence id="95">But other than that our life did not change that much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: You stayed in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: We stayed in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="116">You see we were not materialistically, we were not rich or we were not -- I guess my family was part of the intellectual group in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so our life has not changed much.</sentence><sentence id="117">This went on for not quite two years.</sentence><sentence id="118">Our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> didn't lose a beat.</sentence><sentence id="119">The only thing is that the official language changed into Russian.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="125">Q: Were you taught Russian in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="129">Q: And were the <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nationalized, that kind of thing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="131">A: Well you know what was happening and again this is all in retrospect which I didn't realize.</sentence><sentence id="132">Some people would disappear in the middle of the night and not be heard from again.</sentence><sentence id="133">And these were probably the people that they considered capitalists.</sentence><sentence id="134">These were business people who owned <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">Yes, I guess the <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> changed hands so to speak and all of a sudden there was a shortage of one item, two items, three items.</sentence><sentence id="136">Yes, definitely, the whole picture of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> did change.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: Can I back up just a little bit before the invasion?</sentence><sentence id="144">Do you remember your father, your family in general being concerned about the Germans coming to power, the Nazis coming to power and becoming more powerful?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Well, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="148">This was not discussed in front of me but I know my father had a fantastic <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in his little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and now and again they would have meetings and they closed the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">A lot of people would come, a lot of his students and they would talk and then I would never see them again.</sentence><sentence id="150">And then I found that a lot of them emigrated in a clandestine way illegally.</sentence><sentence id="151">And a lot of them ended up, many as a matter of fact, ended up in what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and some of them ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="152">And some of them we never heard of again.</sentence><sentence id="153">But yes, there were many discussions and there were concerns.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Now you said something about earlier when we spoke about trying to get out and go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> your father.....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Yes, my father.....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: When did he try to do this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="170">A: Well, it seems like all my life there was talk about it but I know that at one point, I don't know exactly, I think it was 1938, we all had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and be interviewed or something and this was part of the process of getting ready to emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="172">Q: But the papers just didn't come through before the invasion?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="174">A: I don't know what happened but apparently so, unfortunately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Was there anything, you know you talked about your life under the Soviets when they came in, I there anything else that strikes you about the Soviet rule about anything that you could remember that was very striking to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: Well, I guess going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent.</sentence><sentence id="179">It didn't affect any of my immediate friends so I am very hazy about it and I know that it was difficult and I know that they probably nationalized the <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and all but from my own personal point of view I cannot relate to it too much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="182">Q: You made mention about the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">Was there a conscious effort by the authorities to discourage religious practices?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: I don't know, I'm sure it was but it was done in a very subtle way and I think my father was conscious of it and probably cognizant of it that he is not supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> too often.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: You said he was allowed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">Do you remember if he was allowed to travel freely in that way back or forth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: Yeah, he was traveling back and forth but I don't think we traveled anyplace else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="194">Q: Why don't you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Well, that happened in the summer of "41.</sentence><sentence id="197">Again I guess Hitler and Stalin, or Hitler decided to break his agreement with Stalin and he started pursuing his evil plans by occupying the territories first of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and then going on to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">The Germans came, again it's almost like out of nowhere, again with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and their soldiers were much -- they were dressed sharp, they looked sharp.</sentence><sentence id="199">To me it was an event of change, but in a way exciting.</sentence><sentence id="200">It's hard to say that but it was.</sentence><sentence id="201">They came in and we didn't know what to expect.</sentence><sentence id="202">I know my parents were very depressed but they did not share these feelings with us openly.</sentence><sentence id="203">Again we saw a lot of refugees, as we call them now, people going with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="204">Why we didn't do it, I don't know. ""</sentence><sentence id="205">m sure it's very difficult to make decisions like these when you have a family, when you're on your own.</sentence><sentence id="206">I want to track back and I think that my father was an ardent Zionist and I think that we didn't go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for two reasons and this is my conjecture.</sentence><sentence id="207">One, the authorities and the red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time and secondly my father's heart really didn't belong there and yet being a family man with two kids it was difficult for him to make a decision to do what he told his students to do and a lot of them did then.</sentence><sentence id="208">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="228">Q: Do you think he was advocating for many of them to leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="230">A: Oh, I know he did because we made a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1985 (decade is unclear) or so and I met some of his students.</sentence><sentence id="231">They organized an evening to honor the memory of my parents, especially my father, their mentor, and they told me that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="234">Q: Did they remember you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Yes, they remembered me as a little pain in the neck.</sentence><sentence id="237">Yes, they did.</sentence><sentence id="238">And I remembered some of them.</sentence><sentence id="239">Yes, my father was really an ardent Zionist.</sentence><sentence id="240">I didn't realize then, I didn't know that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Did you know much of his activities in that <span class="DLF">vein</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: No, I know he was preoccupied with education and all.</sentence><sentence id="249">He had a number of doctorates from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and that was his life.</sentence><sentence id="250">But the rest of it, no, I did not know.</sentence><sentence id="251">He was a wonderful father, he was very stern.</sentence><sentence id="252">There was discipline.</sentence><sentence id="253">We did not speak at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> until he spoke.</sentence><sentence id="254">But that was all right, we didn't know any different so that was okay.</sentence><sentence id="255">I think I digressed from something that you asked.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: No, that's okay.</sentence><sentence id="265">We can get back to it.</sentence><sentence id="266">I've got a couple of other questions but I wanted to step back just a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="267">I asked you about the invasion, the German invasion, but I wanted to step back just a little bit if | could.</sentence><sentence id="268">Before when we talked about how your father had discussions with students and other people about Germans, the Nazis coming to power and that kind of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Yes, I think so because there were all sorts of newspapers and the radios and the political situation was discussed constantly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Do you, now this is an interesting question because many people at the time especially historians speculate that some people in the Soviet Union may not have known or tried to play down the fact that the Germans were going to invade.</sentence><sentence id="277">Do you remember if your father was concerned about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="281">I think he was always concerned with the world situation and they always, I mean at these discussions and these gatherings political situations were always discussed whether it was a concert or poetry reading or so but yes it was always discussed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: When the invasion happened in June of 41 do you remember how long it was after the invasion started that the Germans came into your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or arrive in the <span class="REGION">area</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="286">A: I would say within a week, not any longer than that.</sentence><sentence id="287">There was no bloodshed or anything.</sentence><sentence id="288">They just came in.</sentence><sentence id="289">In the very beginning, I don't know if it was the same day they marched in or the next day, all the Jews, right away they zeroed in on the Jews, we had to meet at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and right away they started with their decrees to strip us of all material possessions slowly but very systematically.</sentence><sentence id="290">The first request was for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all the silver, all the radios, everything that had any material value, carpets, Persian carpets, you wouldn't imagine, furs, fur coats, all sorts of things we had to bring to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, or whatever, I think it was the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, the Germans took that.</sentence><sentence id="291">And that went on for about a</sentence><sentence id="293">week.</sentence><sentence id="294">Then they went around with a list of people which tells me that the local inhabitants had to give them that list.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Somebody had to give them that list.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="308">They didn't know the names and they went for specific men.</sentence><sentence id="309">These men were all the leaders, the Jewish leaders in the community.</sentence><sentence id="310">And of course my father was one of them and they took him away.</sentence><sentence id="311">Just like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="317">Q: And that was within the first week of them being there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="319">A: Within the first week or maybe the very beginning of the second week, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="320">There was so much chaos and so much confusion.</sentence><sentence id="321">I don't recall but every day since the Germans came in was just like a nightmare in the beginning and that was not even the real nightmare.</sentence><sentence id="322">But that's the way I lost my father.</sentence><sentence id="323">They came in.</sentence><sentence id="324">He saw them; he tried to run out through the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, through the back way and they were in the back there with the Ukrainians and they grabbed him and that was that.</sentence><sentence id="325">The rumor had it that these people, the leaders of our community were taken away and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">Now I find out that there was a big question mark.</sentence><sentence id="327">Some people told me that it's probable that they were all executed right there and there's supposed to be a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988.</sentence><sentence id="328">Or some of them did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="329">I searched in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> for any sign, lists and all.</sentence><sentence id="330">I could not find anything and I still to this day, I do not know how or when my father died.</sentence><sentence id="331">After they took away the leaders of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was a very organized plan to just cause chaos and confusion once the leaders were gone.</sentence><sentence id="332">Then they, I don't know the sequence, the chronological sequence, but they burnt all our <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and they gathered, we had to be there to watch it, every Jewish person.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="347">Q: ...was taken out to watch it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: ..to watch it.</sentence><sentence id="350">They burned all our books of prayer, our Torahs, everything.</sentence><sentence id="351">And they did that in one day.</sentence><sentence id="352">Then we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">Everyone who was fourteen years or older was ordered to work.</sentence><sentence id="354">In the morning they would gather in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>, my sister and my mother.</sentence><sentence id="355">I mean it was such a stupid, useless....most of the work was useless.</sentence><sentence id="356">My mother was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="357">My sister at that point was also digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">Then, after a little while, every day there were different decrees and different orders, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">Before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized, one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and several Germans came out and they came up to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked where my father's <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was and my father had a rare collection of first edition books and I mean that was his life's hobby (all the little money we had I think he spent on the rare books) and they knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="360">How did they know about it?Somebody told them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="374">Q: And these were Germans who came?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="376">A: Germans, yes.</sentence><sentence id="377">And they cleaned out his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> which was stacked.</sentence><sentence id="378">My father's <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was a place where we had to wash our hands to go in.</sentence><sentence id="379">We were not allowed to touch the books without his permission.</sentence><sentence id="380">He really had a fantastic collection.</sentence><sentence id="381">But anyway they took it all, packed it in boxes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="388">Q: This was after he had been taken way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="393">A: Yes, that was after he had been taken away.</sentence><sentence id="394">And they gave my mother a receipt.</sentence><sentence id="395">They thanked the gnaidika frau.</sentence><sentence id="396">They thanked her yet and they drive off.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="401">Q: At this point in time not long after the invasion do you remember if there was a differentiation between what we might call like German soldiers and maybe Nazi troops, that kind of thing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="403">Do you remember that at all?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="406">Q: They were just German soldiers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="408">A: They were just Germans to us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="410">Q: Do you remember when the Germans actually came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, were there people who were happy to see them and not just because they were fascists but maybe against the communists or that kind..?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="412">A: Oh yes, they were greeting them with flowers, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="414">Q: There were a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> doing this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
