<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1053">A: Okay, so we moved, as I said, we came on these two different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> that took about 10 days to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and normally the trip is like two days at the most.</sentence><sentence id="1054">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> my uncle, who was my father's younger brother who lived there, had found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="1055">It was an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at -- we had one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, my aunt and grandmother had another in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1056">And we went</sentence><sentence id="1058">5 there.</sentence><sentence id="1059">It was spring, so I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would have been over pretty soon.</sentence><sentence id="1060">And I guess we were trying to -- to get acquainted to -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and to -- to find our way around.</sentence><sentence id="1061">There wasn't much we were doing as far as I was concerned.</sentence><sentence id="1062">My only playmate was my cousin, who was 11 years old -- I mean, 11 months older than me, and we were constant companions.</sentence><sentence id="1063">I don't remember having friends, or being encouraged to -- to make friends.</sentence><sentence id="1064">Since I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, of course I couldn't meet other children.</sentence><sentence id="1065">Then, in September of 1943, we went into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1066">And the events prior to this, I remember them very clearly.</sentence><sentence id="1067">I had the mumps, and I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> was adjacent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1068">So my -- all my aunts, and uncles came and they were having meetings with my parents in this <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, and I could hear them whispering.</sentence><sentence id="1069">I could not make out any words, but I knew something very serious was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1070">And obviously they were planning where each one was going to go, what they were going to do, and it was like a big family meeting.</sentence><sentence id="1071">My sister was in that -- in that meeting.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Occasionally she would come out and check on me, to make sure I was all right, or put some hot pads on my cheeks, which was the normal treatment.</sentence><sentence id="1073">And then she would go back in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1074">And when I would ask what is it that -- why are you all in there, and she would say, "Well, we -- we just need to discuss some adult things.</sentence><sentence id="1075">Don't worry, everything is fine."</sentence><sentence id="1076">And but of course I worried, because I knew everything wasn't fine.</sentence><sentence id="1077">So I remember that very, very clearly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1104">Q: What had triggered this -- what had triggered the plan, and the crisis, if you like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1106">A: I think the fact that they were hearing more and more things about the Germans coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and I think it was about the time that <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> capitulated, and they probably knew that if Germans come, they would probably treat the Jews the same way they treated them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1107">So some advance thinking, at least to have the plan, and if you need to use it, you use it.</sentence><sentence id="1108">It was necessary to do that time.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1113">Q: Was there any leadership coming through the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, do you think, to help people deal with this?</sentence><sentence id="1114">I mean, did all families begin to make plans at the same time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1115">A: I don't know for sure, but I have a feeling they probably did.</sentence><sentence id="1116">Some decided the very last moment to go somewhere, because this is something you don't want to believe that this going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="1117">It's pretty unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="1118">So most people denied as wildly exaggerating, or this isn't going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="1119">But people with advanced thinking, and people who know about the world, I guess, don't leave things to chances.</sentence><sentence id="1120">And my father was one of these people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1127">Q: Meanwhile, you were living under false names in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, but would your -- would neighbors know your real identity, or would you keep very much to family, and not be mixing much with people who were not close to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1129">A: That is true.</sentence><sentence id="1130">I don't remember mixing much with other people.</sentence><sentence id="1131">We didn't have neighbors -- actually, there was a lady but i -- who lived in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, but I think she was also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And we pretty much stayed with the family.</sentence><sentence id="1133">I don't remember venturing out much -- I mean, not -- we were free to come and go, but I would always go out with someone, I would never go out alone.</sentence><sentence id="1134">But there was no -- no particular friends that I remember at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1141">Q: Now, from the time of these whispered meetings, when you had the mumps, to the time when you left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and went into hiding, how much time went by?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1143">A: Probably a month.</sentence><sentence id="1144">Because we went into hiding in September of 43, and the meetings must have been like a few -- a month, or maybe two at the most, before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1147">Q: And what preparation -- obviously the planning was going on, but as a child, do you have any memory of the activities going on in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1148">I mean, was there packing of valuables, or anything that you remember observing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1154">A: I don't think we have any valuables, because I think a lot of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was in there, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1155">It wa -- I don't think it was our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, I don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="1156">So this probably was a -- a <span class="NPIP">furnished place</span> when we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1157">As far as clothing, I think we took whatever we needed, which wasn't much at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1158">Maybe some books.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I took my favorite doll.</sentence><sentence id="1160">I was a big doll person.</sentence><sentence id="1161">And I guess that was it, but no utensils, or anything else, because when we were into hiding, we lived with other families, not Jewish families, Greek Orthodox families, so they had their own <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1170">Q: And when you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volos</span>, and came to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, you'd already taken a huge -- or made a huge change in your standard of living.</sentence><sentence id="1171">I assume that the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> would be much more sparse, you'd left all your possessions and so on behind.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1212">Q: And then wa -- when it comes to going into hiding, you had to know that you could trust the people that you were going to be with.</sentence><sentence id="1213">What do you know about the -- how the family split up, who you stayed with.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1216">A: Okay, first of all, my father had found this <span class="NPIP">place</span> through a friend, a very good friend of his.</sentence><sentence id="1217">He had baptized the oldest child, by the name of Many Babella, and he knew the family well.</sentence><sentence id="1218">So he had talked to them, and they had agreed to take us.</sentence><sentence id="1219">Of course, families could not -- families could not be together if there were more than two, three people, because they could be easily spotted, and they had to disperse.</sentence><sentence id="1220">My father went to some other family, and my mother and I, and sister, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calivare</span>, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, to this wonderful family of a couple, the name was Pavella.</sentence><sentence id="1221">And they had three children, a 15 year old, and one girl who was Kate, she was 10, as I was, and a younger boy about six or seven, called Dimitris.</sentence><sentence id="1222">My mother, sister, and I shared one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1223">So the three of us shared one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, my father was elsewhere, and we had our meals with the family, I was playing with the children, who were about the same age as I was.</sentence><sentence id="1224">I wasn't going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my excuse was that I had appendicitis.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And I wasn't supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1226">This was what I was telling the children.</sentence><sentence id="1227">Of course, they all wanted to see my incision, and there was no incision.</sentence><sentence id="1228">Basically, I liked these kids, and they were just great, they were warm, and would play all sorts of games, and we had a great connection.</sentence><sentence id="1229">My mother would communicate with my father once a week by telephone, and this was like a coded message.</sentence><sentence id="1232">9 When the news were bad, the message was, the patient is very sick.</sentence><sentence id="1233">When the news was better, it was that, well, the patient is doing better.</sentence><sentence id="1234">So, this was a pre-arranged kind of code for them to communicate.</sentence><sentence id="1235">My sister became good friends with the sister of the woman who hid us, the family there.</sentence><sentence id="1236">She had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> right across from where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1237">And my sister would go there sometimes, and also Adhero will come to -- to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1238">She was very warm, and caring, and often will bring cookies from the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1263">Q: I -- I wanted to clarify your not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was really because your -- you were more effectively hidden if you didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1265">A: Right, yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1267">Q: And then -- well, loo -- let's go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1269">A: Yeah, I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, because that involves being <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and being in public.</sentence><sentence id="1270">The -- the fear was that somebody may recognize us.</sentence><sentence id="1271">Same thing for my mother and sister, we couldn't venture very far other than across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>, because although we had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volos</span>, where we were very well known, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> we were more -- more unknown people, it still the possibility that somebody would recognize us, and mention our names, and then everybody will be in great peril.</sentence><sentence id="1272">Of course, the family that hid us was in danger by hiding us.</sentence><sentence id="1273">These were wonderful people.</sentence><sentence id="1274">He worked for -- the man of the family worked for a Greek newspaper, so he could bring home news of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1275">His wife was also a very good housekeeper, caring for the children, and very nice, and my mother and Dasseia became friends.</sentence><sentence id="1276">And even after the war they would see each other.</sentence><sentence id="1277">And there was great respect for each other.</sentence><sentence id="1278">So there was -- there were good feelings there, and a good connection.</sentence><sentence id="1279">As I said, we couldn't go out, we couldn't do things that we normally used to do.</sentence><sentence id="1280">But maybe for my mother this was a big loss, but for me it was fun because there were children to play with.</sentence><sentence id="1281">At some point, I think it was probably</sentence><sentence id="1283">0 around December, which was like three months after we went into hiding to the Pavella family, my father joined us.</sentence><sentence id="1284">I guess he had become very lonely in the family he was with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and he decided to come to be with us.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Of course, this was with the agreement of the family we lived in.</sentence><sentence id="1286">But shortly after, I remember it very clearly, one evening, Adhero, the -- the wife's sister, who had the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>, came running to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and saying, "You must leave immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1287">I heard from somebody that they know you are Jewish, and you are hiding."</sentence><sentence id="1288">We used to tell, or the family used to tell that we were relatives, because sometimes we would be out in the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, and people would ask, who are these people?</sentence><sentence id="1289">They say they were relatives.</sentence><sentence id="1290">And this man, who happened to be drunk, and he was in a <span class="BUILDING">tavern</span>, in a <span class="BUILDING">Greek tavern</span>, he said, "Don't get fooled, these people are not relatives of the Pavella family, they are Jews, and they are hiding."</sentence><sentence id="1291">So it was heard by everybody who was in that <span class="BUILDING">tavern</span>, and Adhero happened to be there.</sentence><sentence id="1292">And she ran and told us to leave immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1293">Well, the first one who left was my father, because he was in greater danger.</sentence><sentence id="1294">And he walked from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calivare</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> with the man of the family, Milanos Pavella.</sentence><sentence id="1295">He wouldn't let him go by himself.</sentence><sentence id="1296">He took him on foot.</sentence><sentence id="1297">And the next night, all three of us, my mother, my sister, and I, when it became dark, we also left with him.</sentence><sentence id="1298">He came back, of course, after taking my father to a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1299">He came back and took us to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1300">Now this is about, I don't know, probably -- I remember walking for a long, long, long time in the night.</sentence><sentence id="1301">I don't know exactly how far it is, but I'm sure it must be like six miles, 10 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1302">So it's a long walk for a 10 year old.</sentence><sentence id="1303">And we had put scarfs on our heads, and tied them so people wouldn't recognize us immediately.</sentence><sentence id="1304">So when we go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, we immediately went where my father was, at the <span class="BUILDING">friend's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1305">Now these were very good friends, who were notified, apparently, when this incident of somebody saying that we were Jews occurred.</sentence><sentence id="1306">And they were looking for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to go.</sentence><sentence id="1307">But until they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, we</sentence><sentence id="1309">1 couldn't stay together, because they were in danger.</sentence><sentence id="1310">So my sister went to a <span class="BUILDING">friend's house</span>, one of her friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volos</span>, that family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and they took her.</sentence><sentence id="1311">And I went -- they took me to somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and all I remember, it was like a <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span>, a huge <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1312">And there lived a man in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1313">I think he was an old man, but here again [indecipherable] wrong, being 10 years old -- and a woman who was taking care of him.</sentence><sentence id="1314">I don't think she was a relative, I think she was a caretaker.</sentence><sentence id="1315">And I was left there for 10 days by myself, not having communication with my family, not knowing what was going on, not knowing these people.</sentence><sentence id="1316">I think this man didn't talk to me, or if he did, it must have been one or two words, or maybe he couldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="1317">| remember the woman feeding him, spoonfeeding him, so obviously he was pretty sick.</sentence><sentence id="1318">And I was desperate.</sentence><sentence id="1319">I was totally lost.</sentence><sentence id="1320">I didn't know what happened to my parents, I didn't know if they would ever pick me up.</sentence><sentence id="1321">But the woman, the caretaker of this man was a very kind woman, so when I would cry, she would try to comfort me, or tell me stories, or all sorts of things, just to make me feel good about it.</sentence><sentence id="1322">Well, in about 10 days, my sister came, and she said, "We have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="1323">I'm ga -- I'm here to pick you up, to take you."</sentence><sentence id="1324">I don't know if she had called before or not, I don't recall.</sentence><sentence id="1325">But I took my little satchel of things, a couple of changes of clothe -- clothes, and my doll, and said good-bye and left.</sentence><sentence id="1326">And we went -- we met again at this <span class="BUILDING">friend's house</span>, and we went, I think in installments again, my father went first, or we went first, to the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, where we spent about seven months.</sentence><sentence id="1327">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kipserly</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1328">It was the family of Andonis Vayas, who was an officer in the navy.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And they had -- he and his wife had the little girl about three years old.</sentence><sentence id="1330">And I think there was a grandmother who was deaf, and also lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but we hardly saw her.</sentence><sentence id="1331">She stayed in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the most time.</sentence><sentence id="1332">Anyway, so it was a new adjustment.</sentence><sentence id="1333">We had a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the four of us, so there was like a -- a screen put in the middle, so on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> where my parents were sleeping, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was my</sentence><sentence id="1335">2 sister and I. We were sharing the other side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1336">And we were closer to the <span class="DLF">street</span>, it was on a street level, and closer to the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1337">I slept on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1338">And I remember at night I would hear the Germans patrolling, and I could hear their boots going by my <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1339">And I would stop breathing.</sentence><sentence id="1340">I was so petrified, because I thought they were coming for us.</sentence><sentence id="1341">And I would pull the blanket over my head, and stop breathing, I -- until I couldn't -- I couldn't do it any more, and I had to breathe.</sentence><sentence id="1342">So then slowly I will pull the blanket off my head, and I would listen very carefully, and by then the steps with the boots -- because I knew -- I knew they were boots, would disa -- have disappeared, or they would have gone away, or they were far, so I knew we were safe.</sentence><sentence id="1343">This was my biggest fear, that they would come and get us.</sentence><sentence id="1344">Here again, I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1345">My father tried to teach me some arithmetic, and I think I had two books, "Robinson Crusoe," and another one, which was a rather gloomy book called, ""The Orphans of <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1346">And it was nothing but -- you know, five orphans, or maybe more, whose father was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and how they got him out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span>, and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1347">But it was a rather sad book, if I remember correctly.</sentence><sentence id="1348">Then I got hold of a children's magazine heyou -- I think it was a weekly magazine.</sentence><sentence id="1349">I don't know who gave it to us, or how I got hold of it, and it had wonderful stories, and this was very nice for me too, to read.</sentence><sentence id="1350">Other than that, think my imagination went wild, because I used to play in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span>, and all I would do is pick up bamboo stick, and pretend it was a gun, and was shooting all the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1351">And we were free, I thought, by me doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1352">Games like this.</sentence><sentence id="1353">Occasional I will play with a three year old little girl.</sentence><sentence id="1354">But that was about it.</sentence><sentence id="1355">The <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> had a <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and the next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was also a two story <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I think, and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> there was a little girl who would be out practically every day, and playing with dolls, and other toys.</sentence><sentence id="1356">And I would go next to the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and we started talking.</sentence><sentence id="1357">And she would always invite me to go to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to play.</sentence><sentence id="1358">But of course, I knew I couldn't, so I would find all sorts of</sentence><sentence id="1360">3 excuses that I couldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="1361">But one time I couldn't bear it any more, so I jumped the <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1362">On our side of the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, the <span class="DLF">fence</span> was reasonably manageable, I could go over it.</sentence><sentence id="1363">But when I jumped, it was very high on her side.</sentence><sentence id="1364">I'm glad I didn't break a leg.</sentence><sentence id="1365">So I jumped the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and went to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and played there for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="1366">Of course, nobody in my family knew that I left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1367">But when it was time for me to go back, I just couldn't climb the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, it was too much.</sentence><sentence id="1368">So finally I decided I had to go around the corner, because this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was around the corner.</sentence><sentence id="1369">So I came, and rang the <span class="DLF">doorbell</span>, and of course the woman opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and she was so surprised to see me.</sentence><sentence id="1370">And my mother came, and she was absolutely pale when she saw me.</sentence><sentence id="1371">I got a good spanking for that, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1372">I wasn't supposed to -- to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, especially not telling anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1373">But it was that urge to be with other children, to be able to play, to be -- to have a normal life like any other child that made me do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1487">Q: Now, at first when you were rescued by your sister from the elderly man, that must have been simply wonderful, to be reunited again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1489">A: Oh sure, that was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1491">Q: And I am guessing that was the hardest experience, is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1493">A: Yes, it was a very hard experience.</sentence><sentence id="1494">It was a hard experience because I've never been alone with strangers.</sentence><sentence id="1495">I was -- I didn't know -- I had the feeling that -- oh, I was afraid that maybe my parents were taken by the Germans, and I couldn't see them again, or they wouldn't come back for me, or they would leave me there forever.</sentence><sentence id="1496">That was the feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1497">It was a sense of abandonment, but I'm sure they had no other choice to -- to send me any <span class="NPIP">place</span> else, I mean, I don't know what went on, and how it was decided for me to go to this <span class="BUILDING">man's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1498">Obviously not everybody is willing to take a 10 year old under such circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="1499">You know, 10 year olds talk, and jump <span class="DLF">fences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1500">So they are dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1501">But it was -- it was a very sad time for me.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1505">Q: Do you think that that's stayed with you, any of those feelings?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1506">A: Well, I think the fear of abandonment has stayed.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And at different times I have felt it quite strongly.</sentence><sentence id="1508">Also, I think at times when I think a child being left alone, although there were people -</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1512">Q: This is tape number two, side B.

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1516">A: Well, after the second one, yeah, we went to a third one because the -- my father was taken by the Greek Nazis -- Greek SS, as they used to call them.</sentence><sentence id="1517">They were watching the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in -- the third <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and -- no, actually, the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kipserly</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1518">And one day they burst in, pretending they were people from the <span class="BUILDING">power company</span>, and they wanted to read the meter, but they came in with guns, and they were asking for Moudzoukos.</sentence><sentence id="1519">And they took him, and fortunately he had money on him.</sentence><sentence id="1520">He had British pounds that were all sewn around his west -- waistband, and he paid them.</sentence><sentence id="1521">And they told him that he and his family had to leave within five hours, and they didn't guarantee his safety, or anybody else's safety.</sentence><sentence id="1522">So when they came to get my father -- panic-stricken my mother, and my sister, and me -- my sister went next door -- here again, she jumped from a <span class="DLF">terrace</span> to the next <span class="DLF">terrace</span>, where there were people that had help us find this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="1523">And this was in -- somebody in the -- I think in the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span>, or -- he was in charge, anyway, and we knew them.</sentence><sentence id="1524">So she notify them, and they notified another friend, who immediately came -- nearby there was a <span class="BUILDING">market</span>, and he was watching the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to</sentence><sentence id="1526">5 see the activity and what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1527">And as soon as they brought my father back, he came in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took us to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1528">And from there he found another <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="1529">So I think we stayed overnight, or maybe a couple of days, until a second hou -- a third <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was found.</sentence><sentence id="1530">And that's when we moved again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1547">Q: And all these families that were taking you in were Greek Orthodox families?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1549">A: Yes, they were Greek Orthodox families, they were also compensated financially.</sentence><sentence id="1550">Because there were expenses, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1551">We had to eat, and they had to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1552">And of course, there was some danger in there.</sentence><sentence id="1553">So they were being compensated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1559">Q: I mean, were they richly rewarded, or was it -- or do you feel it was simply that you were allowed to make a contribution for real costs?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1561">A: I don't know the answer.</sentence><sentence id="1562">I have a feeling that at the time, it was just for expenses, but I know that after the war, they were very much helped by my father when things started going much better.</sentence><sentence id="1563">Because I remember this navy officer who would come often, and ask for a loan, or things like that.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And then my father would forgive the loan.</sentence><sentence id="1565">So probably it was after the war, but I -- I don't know for sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1571">Q: Lalso assume that they were taking very great risks.</sentence><sentence id="1572">What would -- if they had been found to have been sheltering Jews, would their lives be in danger, as we -- as well as the other side of that is that your lives were in their hands.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1575">A: Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1576">They were very courageous people to do that, and they were great human beings to be able to -- to help somebody else at such a risk, yes, because if anybody was found to be sheltering Jews, could be shot, he and his family.</sentence><sentence id="1577">So, it was a great danger to have Jews in the family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1581">Q: What did they give as their reasons?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1586">A: Their reasons for what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1588">Q: For -- for sheltering you, would they say this -- you would do it for us, or this is just common human decency?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1590">A: Yeah, I think that that was the main thing, that this was common decency.</sentence><sentence id="1591">I remember Pavellas, the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we went, when he learned that this guy said something about us being Jewish, and hiding, and you know, he came to notify us.</sentence><sentence id="1592">She said, "You know, the -- the Nazi may come and take them."</sentence><sentence id="1593">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milanos</span> said, "Over my dead body."</sentence><sentence id="1594">So he had a very sense -- a very good sense of protecting us, of not letting anything happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="1595">That's why he dro -- he -- he walk with my father from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calivare</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and the next day he walk back again with my sister -- my mother, and my sister, and myself.</sentence><sentence id="1596">So, I mean, he was a man who would take it very seriously that this was the lives of people that were under his care, and he wouldn't let anything happen, I mean, as far as he could control that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1604">Q: I-It does seem very na -- I mean, he was doing the right thing, but it also seems to me admirable, because his own children were placed at risk in -- in acting morally, and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2496">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2497">A-Also let me tell you that since we got engaged, I would receive huge bouquets of flower every single day, to the point that we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to put them, because you know -- and there was always a note from Isaac, you know, with every delivery of flowers.</sentence><sentence id="2498">And that was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="2499">So to get back to your question, when did we make plans.</sentence><sentence id="2500">I think it was understood that I would come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2501">At that time, I was applying for a scholarship to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to study.</sentence><sentence id="2502">And I had applied to <span class="BUILDING">Barnard College</span>, and I forget what else.</sentence><sentence id="2503">But I had a</sentence><sentence id="2505">5 couple of <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2506">And Isaac told me that if I come as a student, I cannot stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2507">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> to get some advice, and they told us that indeed, I could not -- I could get the scholarship, but I -- even -- I couldn't get married in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and remain in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2508">The Greek visa was oversubscribed.</sentence><sentence id="2509">So I think it was something like 10 years of waiting, or something like that, which didn't thrill me.</sentence><sentence id="2510">And one of the suggestions was that maybe I can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, and get married in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, and then for Isaac to apply for me to come from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a spouse.</sentence><sentence id="2511">Because <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> had no -- no quota.</sentence><sentence id="2512">So we thought about it, and thought about it, a-and we thought it might be a good idea.</sentence><sentence id="2513">My -- there was a family that we knew who had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2514">This was my brother-in-law's -- Yola's husband's cousin.</sentence><sentence id="2515">And they had moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> like maybe two years before that.</sentence><sentence id="2516">So Freddie, my brother-in-law, wrote to them and told them the situation, and asked them if I could stay with them while all the paperwork was being done.</sentence><sentence id="2517">And they said they would be very glad to have me there.</sentence><sentence id="2518">So that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2519">A friend my sister's, who was working for HIAS, the Hebrew Immigration Society, said to me, "You know we are going to speed things up for you.</sentence><sentence id="2520">Why don't you get your police report, your health records, and everything else you need, and we'll send them to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2521">So after you marry, the -- all your -- all that your husband has to do,"-- [indecipherable], "all that your husband has to do is to -- to apply for you to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and this will save you a lot of paperwork over there."</sentence><sentence id="2522">I said fine.</sentence><sentence id="2523">So I did all this preliminary work, and Linda sent everything to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2524">So I left in April of 58 for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2525">It was -- didn't hit me until I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, and I said to myself, where am I going, all by myself, to somebody I don't really know.</sentence><sentence id="2526">I just wanted the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to come back.</sentence><sentence id="2527">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> kept going.</sentence><sentence id="2528">And eventually I re -- I reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>, my friends were there to greet me at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2529">And this was a family that they had two children, a</sentence><sentence id="2531">6 six year old, and a baby.</sentence><sentence id="2532">And I shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the six year old, and also the mother -- his mother lived with them, in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2533">So Isaac came I think the next weekend, or two weekends later to see me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2575">Q: How long was it since you'd seen Isaac in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2577">A: Oh, it was -- let's see, we got engaged in September "57 --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2579">Q: -- a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</sentence><sentence id="2580">This is tape number three, side B. You were telling me about being reunited with Isaac.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2583">A: Yeah, so we went to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> to pick him up, the family and I. And I couldn't wait in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span>, I was so anxious to see the -- see him.</sentence><sentence id="2584">So I went <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2585">Apparently when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> landed, you had to walk <span class="NPIP">outside</span> into the -- into the <span class="BUILDING">terminal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2586">So I see him coming, and I was freezing there, it was so windy, and so cold, but I was waiting there to see him.</sentence><sentence id="2587">And he was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2588">It was really wonderful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2595">Q: Removed all your doubts.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2597">A: Yes, yes, it was -- it was nice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2599">Q: And then you planned to marry in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, shortly after that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2601">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Isaac was married before, for a short period of time.</sentence><sentence id="2603">And we had to -- to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> for him to sign some papers for the final decree, which we did.</sentence><sentence id="2604">And I think shortly after that he dis -- his divorce papers came through.</sentence><sentence id="2605">And we went again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span>, and we got married by a Justice of Peace.</sentence><sentence id="2606">I was all dressed up, not in a wedding gown, but in a very fancy, elegant dress that's -- my parents made me at a very great attag -- couturier, as we used to call it, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2607">And the question was, do I wear a hat, or do I not wear a hat.</sentence><sentence id="2608">And Isaac said, "If you wear a hat,</sentence><sentence id="2610">7 I'm not going to marry you."</sentence><sentence id="2611">So he doesn't like hats, or he didn't like me wearing a hat.</sentence><sentence id="2612">So I thought well, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2613">So we were just the two of us, there was nobody, and you had to have witnesses for the wedding.</sentence><sentence id="2614">So we -- they told us that we can go out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> and ask two people to come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and become our witnesses, or go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eton</span>, we -- which the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and [indecipherable] everybody will come, you're two young people in love, you know, people love stories like this.</sentence><sentence id="2615">Anyway, at the <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span> there was another couple.</sentence><sentence id="2616">It was an older couple -- I mean, older, I would think probably in their 50's.</sentence><sentence id="2617">And they were going to get married also.</sentence><sentence id="2618">So we made an agreement, we would sign -- we would be witnesses at their wedding, and they would be the witnesses in our wedding.</sentence><sentence id="2619">And that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2620">I had to repeat in English, and my English wasn't that good at the time, you know, that's -- I do marry him, and take care of him, for better or worse.</sentence><sentence id="2621">And that was it.</sentence><sentence id="2622">At the time -- the more I think about that now, the more I think how I missed my family not being there, and not having anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2623">And many times I go to <span class="BUILDING">weddings</span>, and I cry my heart out.</sentence><sentence id="2624">And I wanted my daughters to have nice weddings, with lots of people, and friends, and family.</sentence><sentence id="2625">Because I feel that I just -- was a big loss for me not to have anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2626">But on the other hand, at the time, I -- all I wanted was to get married to Isaac.</sentence><sentence id="2627">And to me, that was because there were a few obstacles, as I said, to -- to bypass the immigration laws, to -- to come -- I mean to -- for him to get the divorce papers, and all this kind of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="2628">So these were like little setbacks that kept me wondering would l ever be able to marry this man.</sentence><sentence id="2629">And that's all I wanted at the time, but there was some feeling of not having the people that mattered most in something so important in my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2661">Q: And the waiting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> with the family would not be easy, I assume.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2663">A: Well, okay -- well, so we got married, then we went to Niagara Falls, this was our honeymoon.</sentence><sentence id="2664">And -- okay, so we went for our honeymoon to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niagara Falls</span>, we stayed about a</sentence><sentence id="2666">8 week, and then Isaac returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2667">I wasn't happy at all.</sentence><sentence id="2668">The family I lived with, as I told you, had two children, so in order for me to be busy and think less of Isaac, Sonia gave me full care of the baby.</sentence><sentence id="2669">He was about six or seven months old, little Eddie.</sentence><sentence id="2670">So she would say to me, "You need to practice, you take care of him."</sentence><sentence id="2671">And I would say, "Well, I've never take care of a baby, what do I do?"</sentence><sentence id="2672">She said, "You'll find out.</sentence><sentence id="2673">Just don't let him fall."</sentence><sentence id="2674">And I was taking care of him completely.</sentence><sentence id="2675">I would take him for walks, I would take him out.</sentence><sentence id="2676">We'd play together.</sentence><sentence id="2677">It was wonderful to -- to have a little baby there.</sentence><sentence id="2678">Anyway, meantime -- it takes a long time -- Isaac applied for me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as a spouse.</sentence><sentence id="2679">And at some point he said to me, "You know, you have to go to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> and tell them that - - find out why is it taking so long."</sentence><sentence id="2680">Well, it was taking longer than we thought, and eventually I went to the <span class="BUILDING">HIAS office</span>, to the Hebrew Immigration Society, and saw a social worker there, who got interested in the whole thing, and she made several attempts to find out what was going on, and I think eventually what happened is Isaac had applied for me to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> by the name of Nehama, as his spouse.</sentence><sentence id="2681">The papers that were sent from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, by HIAS were under the name Moudzoukos.</sentence><sentence id="2682">So the two things were never put together, Moudzoukos and Nehama were two different persons for them.</sentence><sentence id="2683">So they never figured it out.</sentence><sentence id="2684">It was only after desperation that Isaac went to his congressman in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> where he lived, and talked to him, and the next day I get a phone call from this social worker, and she said, "Guess what?</sentence><sentence id="2685">You're going tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="2686">We have everything ready for you, the visa is ready, come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2687">And of course, it was wonderful, because it had become to be a big, big problem, you know, six months -- it was six months it took for me being by myself there -- I mean, it wasn't by myself, but still, I was very anxious to start my life, and for Isaac to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2688">So, in November, first day it snowed in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> when I was there, I said good-bye to my friends, and boarded a</sentence><sentence id="2690">9 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, and came here, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and of course, Isaac was a -- waiting, and he already had rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Hiawatha</span>, which at this time I couldn't even say the word Hiawatha.</sentence><sentence id="2691">And I would think, my God, if I get lost, how am I gonna say where I live?</sentence><sentence id="2692">I mean, this is not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take me.</sentence><sentence id="2693">You should take me someplace where I can pronounce, or I can even say it.</sentence><sentence id="2694">So it was -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was all taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="2695">I mean, he had arranged it, and fixed it, and he had a lot of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> there, but decorated very nicely, painted it, just took good care of things.</sentence><sentence id="2696">And then it was, how do I live here, and what do I do, and it was a bit hard.</sentence><sentence id="2697">It was lonely, because I didn't know anybody, although I met two good friends of his, and their wives were marvelous.</sentence><sentence id="2698">They would come and pick me up and take me to lunch, or take me <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and they tried very hard to -- to make me feel comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="2699">But a couple of months later, I -- oh no, I started going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, I would take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">the bus</span> from <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the day time, and started going to the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span>, and just getting a feel of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and I loved it.</sentence><sentence id="2700">And one day, I think Isaac had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> on business, I was looking in the newspaper, and I saw that there was a position open for a social worker that -- to deal with adoptions.</sentence><sentence id="2701">So I called, and made an appointment, and took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and went to -- and indeed, it was the International Social Service in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, that was looking for a social worker, take care of Greek adoptions.</sentence><sentence id="2702">I knew all the social workers in the International Social Service in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> -- I no -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2703">I knew them very well.</sentence><sentence id="2704">And to me this was like a glove that fitted perfectly well.</sentence><sentence id="2705">So I told them I was interested in the job, they said they thought I would be perfect for the job, but they have to communicate with the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and get references from there, and everything else, which they did, and then they called me, and they said, "My goodness, I mean we never heard anything as good as this.</sentence><sentence id="2706">When can you start?"</sentence><sentence id="2707">So I got the job, and I had to commute, of course, every day from <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2708">It would take me like an hour almost, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2709">And it was very</sentence><sentence id="2711">0 exciting, I was very excite -- I didn't know what I was doing, but it was very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="2712">And I liked the people work there, very well, very much.</sentence><sentence id="2713">Then I got pregnant with Sarah, and commuting wasn't the best thing for me.</sentence><sentence id="2714">I had the threatening miscarriage, and the doctor said to me, "Well, all I can tell you is, what you want, the baby or the wor -- the job?"</sentence><sentence id="2715">So I decided I wanted the baby, and that meant I had to stop working.</sentence><sentence id="2716">There was no other way to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> early in the morning, so I stopped working.</sentence><sentence id="2717">And I was sad about that, because I just felt I had reached the point where now I'm able to -- to live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, to work, to become part of it.</sentence><sentence id="2718">So it was a bit sad.</sentence><sentence id="2719">But of course, having a baby was wonderful.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2801">Q: By the way, would you have had any photos of you in that couturier wedding gown?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2803">A: No, because the most horrible thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="2804">I had my camera, and I asked people to take pictures of us because we were going to send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, you know, here are the newlyweds.</sentence><sentence id="2805">And something happened to the film, and no picture came out.</sentence><sentence id="2806">Absolutely no picture.</sentence><sentence id="2807">It was devastating not only to me, but also to my parents, who were saying, "Send us wedding pictures, where are the wedding pictures?"</sentence><sentence id="2808">So I don't have a single photo of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2815">Q: So you have lots of photos of Sarah as a baby.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2821">A: [have photos of all the kids, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2822">Sarah as a baby, I used to send them to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="2823">When Sarah was six months old, I took her to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and that was great.</sentence><sentence id="2824">It was -- because I can now understand how my parents felt, of me being so far away, and not being able to see me, help me.</sentence><sentence id="2825">Here I go through pregnancy, a baby -- a brand new baby.</sentence><sentence id="2826">If you were -- if I were to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, you know, they would be with me, or helping me in every step.</sentence><sentence id="2827">And here I was totally, totally, totally alone.</sentence><sentence id="2828">And it must have been extremely difficult for my mother, especially.</sentence><sentence id="2829">My father too, I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="2830">You know, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> wasn't just available that much those days, tickets were extremely expensive, telephone calls were extremely expensive.</sentence><sentence id="2831">So this is not like the kind of thing you do now, like I call my sister every week.</sentence><sentence id="2832">But st -- you know, he -- it's not a major expense, but those days it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2845">Q: What was happening in your sister's life, at the time when you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2847">A: Well, my sister was married and had a son, he was -- Maurice was about 10 at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2848">Then in "73, her husband died.</sentence><sentence id="2849">And she hasn't remarried since.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2853">Q: So your parents, just at the time when you had left, they would be seeing a lot of your sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2855">A: Oh yeah, yeah, they saw a lot of my sister.</sentence><sentence id="2856">And they lived nearby -- near each other, so you know, they would see each other, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2857">Then there were financial difficulties, the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> wasn't going well.</sentence><sentence id="2858">My father started another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, which was in -- in yarn.</sentence><sentence id="2859"><span class="BUILDING">Factory</span> produced yarn, not material -- not cashmere any more, in order to supply <span class="BUILDING">Volos</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Volos factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2860">But that didn't go very well, and there were really financial problems, and constant problems with the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>, and the creditors, and this and that.</sentence><sentence id="2861">So eventually -- his health was bad, he was diabetic.</sentence><sentence id="2862">His health became bad, and financial conditions had changed, and so he lost the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="2863">So that was very hard for them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2873">Q: They needed -- they needed you with Sarah in your arms.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2878">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2879">And I think the fact that, you know, we had to leave again -- we stayed a couple of months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> with Sarah -- was probably harder for them, because now they had experienced their grandchild, and was taken away from them again, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2882">Q: Now how did you choose Sarah's names -- is that how you pronounce it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2884">A: Sarah.</sentence><sentence id="2885">I used to say Sarah, and when Sarah went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fir</span> -- to first grade, she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she -- I -- I said to her, "Sarah, wash your hands, we're going to have lunch."</sentence><sentence id="2886">And she said, "My name is not Sarah, it's Sarah."</sentence><sentence id="2887">So she had become Americanized.</sentence><sentence id="2888">And -- so Sarah is named after Isaac's mother, who perished in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2889">Maya, her second name is Thalia, which is my mother's name, who also died, not in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="2890">And Nicole middle name is Julie, after Julius Hoffman, Dr. Julius Hoffman, who is the psychiatrist who delivered her at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because she came too fast.</sentence><sentence id="2891">So everybody has meaningful name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2900">Q: I guess -- w-we haven't even -- we haven't even talked about Maya and her birth.</sentence><sentence id="2901">Perhaps you should give the full names and dates of birth of all three of your daughters.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2922">A: Tell the story.</sentence><sentence id="2923">Well, it was a Saturday, thank God, so Isaac was <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2924">Now, my neighbors had told me that if I go to labor, I would call them, and they would take care of the older girls.</sentence><sentence id="2925">So when I woke up in the morning, the water broke, and I found out I -- I had contractions, so I-I timed them, and they were about 10 minutes apart.</sentence><sentence id="2926">So I woke Isaac up, and said to him, you</sentence><sentence id="2928">3 know, "Take care of the kids.</sentence><sentence id="2929">Just give them breakfast or whatever, and I'Il go take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2930">Actually, I did call my doctor, and told him that I was in labor.</sentence><sentence id="2931">And he said, "Oh, 10 minutes, okay.</sentence><sentence id="2932">When the contractions are," -- this was like early in the morning, like eight o'clock, or maybe earlier. "</sentence><sentence id="2933">When the contractions are about five minutes apart, come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2934">And I thought, five minutes apart, that's a little too -- too close, but I didn't say anything, he was the doctor.</sentence><sentence id="2935">So I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, and I had some very strong contractions, so I said, I better lie down.</sentence><sentence id="2936">I don't think I should take a <span

class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, I can't -- so I called Isaac, and I said to him, "Throw me a towel, I'm having a baby."</sentence><sentence id="2941">So Isaac took the towel -- I had taken a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> at ni -- the night before, and threw me the towel -- gave me the towel, and he was in a total panic.</sentence><sentence id="2942">So he looks out of the <span

class="DLF">door</span>, and he calls Dr. Hoffman, and he said, "Jules, Jules, Paulette is having a baby, what do I do?"</sentence><sentence id="2944">So he run to his <span

and don't move."</sentence><sentence id="2968">So when he opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> to see the two, to tell them to come out, both of them were huddled one next to the other, sucking their thumbs, poor things.</sentence><sentence id="2969">I mean, they were -- so m -- I asked to see them, so they came as I was going out the <span class="DLF">door</span> on the <span

and Mrs. Grossman's going to take care of them.</sentence><sentence id="2972">Daddy would be back, I'd be back in a couple of days, and I'll talk to them on the phone.</sentence><sentence id="2973">So off we go, an -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>, and I don't hear the baby crying, so I think she's dead.</sentence><sentence id="2974">I was very worried.</sentence><sentence id="2975">So I kept telling Dr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2976">Hoffman, "I can't hear the baby cry."</sentence><sentence id="2977">And he said, "You want me to pinch her?</sentence><sentence id="2978">She will cry."</sentence><sentence id="2979">I said, "No, don't do that, but is she alive, or is she not?" "</sentence><sentence id="2980">Yes, she's alive, she's breathing all right."</sentence><sentence id="2981">So I go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, the doctor meets me right there at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span>, he takes me down [indecipherable] <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2982">He checks me out, he says, "Mrs. Nehama, you are in perfect health.</sentence><sentence id="2983">It's Mr. Nehama who needs to be <span class="BUILDING">hospitalized</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2984">Isaac was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> with Dr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2985">Hoffman, and he was holding the baby, wrapped in a yellow sha -- the yellow towel.</sentence><sentence id="2986">We have that towel, I gave it to Nicole.</sentence><sentence id="2987">But then I couldn't see the baby, because they put her in isolation, in the intensive care, just to check her out.</sentence><sentence id="2988">And I thought she was dead.</sentence><sentence id="2989">So I keep asking,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2993">5 "Where is my baby, where is the baby?"</sentence><sentence id="2994">They said, "She is fine, she is fine."</sentence><sentence id="2995">I said, "I want to see the baby.</sentence><sentence id="2996">I want to get up to see the baby."</sentence><sentence id="2997">They wouldn't let me get up, although I was fine.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2998">Well, finally in the afternoon they let me get up, and I went by the <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> and there's a woman who is sitting there -- standing there in front of the big <span class="DLF">window</span>, and she said to me, "Did you have a baby today?"</sentence><sentence id="2999">I said, "Yes, how about you?"

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3356">A: Oh, I think it's wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="3357">It's -- it's a wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3358">I think the freedoms you find in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, you don't find them anywhere in the world.</sentence><sentence id="3359">The fact that the <span class="NPIP">place</span> is so diverse also is -- to me, it's very interesting, and very nice.</sentence><sentence id="3360">But it's mostly the personal freedom, of being able to say you're Jewish for instance, you know, which sometimes I couldn't say it in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, although there were no people to hurt me, you know, this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="3361">Or to do things.</sentence><sentence id="3362">Sometimes we take this freedom a little too far, I think, but there's no other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, I think, that's -- freedom is the most wonderful thing to have, and you can find it here.</sentence><sentence id="3363">Also there's</sentence><sentence id="3365">3 another <span class="NPIP">thing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3366">You have opportunities in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and if you are willing to work hard, you can do things.</sentence><sentence id="3367">Like for instance, I went to get my Master's degree when I was 49 years old.</sentence><sentence id="3368">And I remember discussing this with a friend, and I said, "Well, you know, I have grown-up children, they" ll be going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> pretty soon.</sentence><sentence id="3369">I'm 49.</sentence><sentence id="3370">I don't know if I can manage to -- to go get a Master's degree, and he said -- she said to me, "Paulette, if you want to get a Master's degree, go get a Master's degree.</sentence><sentence id="3371">You're going to be 49 whether you get it or not."</sentence><sentence id="3372">And I never forgot that.</sentence><sentence id="3373">And I thought, if I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and I was 49, there wouldn't have been a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to go and get a degree, even if I wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="3374">Even when I was talking to my friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and I would tell them I'm going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> to get a Master's degree, they would think I was sort of well, maybe she's a little cuckoo at this late age, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3375">And to me this was wonderful.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3406">A: Yeah, I'm sure that that was important in their lives, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3407">Actually, Maya and I graduated the same year.</sentence><sentence id="3408">It was funny to have graduations within a couple of weeks apart.</sentence><sentence id="3409">You know, I'm going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, my mother is -- is studying for exams, I can't talk to you now.</sentence><sentence id="3410">Yeah, I think it was a role model, but I think they were -- they would have gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyway, because they were motivated, all of them, and they wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and have a career.</sentence><sentence id="3411">So I don't think it was the only model they had.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3424">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3425">I was affected by the feminist movement, but this is a traditional <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, so a lot of the things that were going on were not totally, totally accepted.</sentence><sentence id="3426">I wanted my daughters to be women who could decide for themselves, who would have a voice, whether it was in a job, in a marriage, or in wherever.</sentence><sentence id="3427">I wanted them to be treated equally with men, not to be discriminated upon.</sentence><sentence id="3428">I wanted more for them than I wanted for me from the women's movement.</sentence><sentence id="3429">And I think they are pretty much with it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3436">Q: Do you think they see themselves as children of survivors?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3438">A: [know Nicole thinks so, and probably the others do too.</sentence><sentence id="3439">There were times that this was difficult for them, because I remember when there were occasions that -- for instance, holidays were difficult in this family, because holidays is something that you have everybody around, and not everybody was around.</sentence><sentence id="3440">So it was always a feeling of loss, not necessarily, you know, a joyous holiday.</sentence><sentence id="3441">Things are mixed bags, often.</sentence><sentence id="3442">So I remember once, one of my daughters said, because I was trying to explain that, you know, both Isaac and I had difficult life, and she said, "Oh Mom, I'm so tired of -- of that.</sentence><sentence id="3443">Let's have the holiday and enjoy it," or whatever, you know, like okay, you had it, but why about us?</sentence><sentence id="3444">So I think she was -- I -- I forget which daughter it was, but I think, you know, to a certain degree they tolerated the difficulties, because they were part of the [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="3445">I don't know that they're -- I think Nicole is more closer to that than the others.</sentence><sentence id="3446">Sarah is too.</sentence><sentence id="3447">Well yeah, I think she is.</sentence><sentence id="3448">She knows the difficulties up to a certain point, but then she chooses not to linger on those things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3460">Q: Why do you think Nicole is more affected?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3462">A: Well, I think she stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> longer, probably.</sentence><sentence id="3463">She is married to a Jewish person.</sentence><sentence id="3464">She has children, and -- boys, and she wants them to be Bar Mitzvahed, and for them to know about</sentence><sentence id="3466">5 our lives, a lot.</sentence><sentence id="3467">And maybe the fact that she went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">day camp</span>, may have had something to do.</sentence><sentence id="3468">So, who knows?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3478">Q: When you spoke of that holidays being difficult, not everyone was here, course your family was not here because of the -- you separated fro-from -- by, you know, vast distances.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3482">Q: And of course, Isaac lost his -- his mother, so their -- a grandmother had died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and their uncle Nehama.</sentence><sentence id="3483">Is that what you're thinking of, the -- the actual, you know, family members lost?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3486">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3487">Mostly family members.</sentence><sentence id="3488">But you see, in the past, when there was a holiday, all the family members will gather around, s-some relatives would come.</sentence><sentence id="3489">So it was a Bible kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="3490">This time, I mean, you go through the motions sometimes, but you feel the lack of these people.</sentence><sentence id="3491">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passover</span> is a difficult time.</sentence><sentence id="3492">Isaac often reads the Haggadah from his father's Haggadah, which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ladeeno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3493">Has both Hebrew, Ladeeno, and Greek.</sentence><sentence id="3494">So he reads passages that he remembers his father read on Passover.</sentence><sentence id="3495">And every time he reads them, you know, I get a chill in my back.</sentence><sentence id="3496">It just -- just, you know, brings tears to my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="3497">And I remember my father reading -- not Ladeeno, but you know, presiding over the Seder, and I know the last time I saw him it was Passover, because he was sick, and I had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, I had taken Nicole with me, who was about three.</sentence><sentence id="3498">Sh -- he had not seen her -- grandchild.</sentence><sentence id="3499">So I took her with me.</sentence><sentence id="3500">And he was quite sick, but he sat at the Seder.</sentence><sentence id="3501">And I knew it was the last time I would see him.</sentence><sentence id="3502">He died shortly after.</sentence><sentence id="3503">He died in October of 1970.</sentence><sentence id="3504">And -- but his [indecipherable] he -- he was dress up, he put his clean, nice, press shirt.</sentence><sentence id="3505">You know, he was very presentable.</sentence><sentence id="3506">And [indecipherable] and my sister was there, her husband, and Maurice, my nephew.</sentence><sentence id="3507">So you miss these people, who were much a part of your life.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3512">Q: And the essence of those holidays, I guess your daughters are right, is the -- the family gathering.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3513">A: Right, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3515">Q: And your -- and it's not there.</sentence><sentence id="3516">I interviewed someone called Susie Schwartz, and she spoke of the -- her wish that there'd -- were another grou -- term for survivor, just because she -- she felt that she had been in hiding in a <span class="BUILDING">farm building</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and her problem was simply with the fact that the -- the common stereotype, or presumption is that survivors survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, when in fact there are many different --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3517">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3518">Q: -- shades and grades of suffering, and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3520">A: That is true.</sentence><sentence id="3521">I mean, for a long time, I did not consider myself a survivor.</sentence><sentence id="3522">I consider myself that I lived through the war.</sentence><sentence id="3523">And the Holocaust, and the hiding was part of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3524">I remember I attended a workshop once in one of the <span class="BUILDING">conferences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3525">It was the American [indecipherable] Psychiatric Association to which I belonged.</sentence><sentence id="3526">And there was something on -- about survivors of the Holocaust, and I attended that, and the first thing I said is, can we make a distinction, who is a survivor?</sentence><sentence id="3527">Because they were talking -- I mean, it was very blurred to me, who is a survivor, and who is not?</sentence><sentence id="3528">So they said everybody who survived both the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and the war, and the hidden children, everybody was -- they lumped them all together.</sentence><sentence id="3529">And to that day, I never thought I was a survivor.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3542">A: Yes I do.</sentence><sentence id="3543">Yes, I do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3546">Q: And it may be that with -- I don't know whether you have any thoughts about how -- when you have reflected more.</sentence><sentence id="3547">You may feel differently.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3553">A: Well, you see, the word survivor implies to a certain degree that you were a victim.</sentence><sentence id="3554">And I don't like to feel victimized, but I was victimized, and so was my family, and Isaac's family, and a lot of other people.</sentence><sentence id="3555">So it's not an approp -- an inappropriate word to use.</sentence><sentence id="3556">But I don't like the label of being victimized, because that kind of sets you in a mold, and in a pattern, that sometimes you can't come out of it, and I don't want that to happen.</sentence><sentence id="3557">In other words, I survived, I made it, I'm healthy, both physically and mentally.</sentence><sentence id="3558">And here I am.</sentence><sentence id="3559">I'll be 70 years old in September.</sentence><sentence id="3560">It's not a small achievement, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3573">Q: But -- but what are the special -- out of your experiences, what would you have other Americans learn from what you have seen and experienced?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3575">A: Well, I like people to -- to know that things like that can happen if we let governments, dictators, crazy people, do all sorts of things, and we do not do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="3576">That's -- we - - the world belongs to everybody, and people are responsible for the world, and I think that we have a responsibility to -- to speak out, and not to let things happen, and to do our part.</sentence><sentence id="3577">I don't know, maybe that's a little -- but I do feel that, you know, I mean I want my friends to know that my life was different from theirs in many ways, and I think the ones who do know, respect it very much.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3579">Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Paulette Nehama.</sentence><sentence id="3580">This is tape number four, side B. I'm jumping to a new question, do you think that you were much more protective of your daughters because of your own experiences?</sentence><sentence id="3581">I mean, you mentioned that one</sentence><sentence id="3583">8 incident with -- with the jacket, but I wondered if you were more fearful in -- in other ways, and in general?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3584">A: I probably was, and I was aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="3585">So I tried not to inflict this on my daughters, because I didn't want them to become fearful people.</sentence><sentence id="3586">And -- but I did have a lot of anxiety about it, their safety, a lot of it.</sentence><sentence id="3587">I just wanted to make sure that they were just okay.</sentence><sentence id="3588">Well, more than okay, actually.</sentence><sentence id="3589">So, I remember Maya had got a new job, a summer job in one of the <span class="BUILDING">ice cream stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3590">I think it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swensen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3591">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span>, an <span class="BUILDING">ice cream parlor</span>, so she was a waitress there.</sentence><sentence id="3592">And she would come -- I mean, the -- the job -- the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> closed at 12, they had to clean up, and I guess she would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one or 1:30.</sentence><sentence id="3593">And I remember saying that I didn't feel this was time for a young girl, driving by herself.</sentence><sentence id="3594">And Isaac, who is very reasonable at times, tries to put reason to everything, tried to convince me that, you know, it didn't make any difference whether she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at 12 or at 10, or at nine, because, he said, "She's going to be in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3595">What difference does it make what time she comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="3596">And I said, ""Well, what if she has a flat tire?</sentence><sentence id="3597">Where is she gonna find help at 12 o'clock at night?</sentence><sentence id="3598">You don't know what can happen."</sentence><sentence id="3599">But he said, "That can happen at nine o'clock as well."</sentence><sentence id="3600">You know, this kind of thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3618">Q: Now, were you -- were you mostly in agreement about disciplining the girls, and other child rearing practices, or did you have strong disagreements?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3620">A: We had some disagreements.</sentence><sentence id="3621">Isaac was very strict, | was more lenient.</sentence><sentence id="3622">And that created some difficulty there.</sentence><sentence id="3623">But it all turned out good, finally.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3640">Q: How closely have you kept in touch, and did that go on constantly, or has there been a -- a reunion and a visit in recent times?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3642">A: Well, for awhile after the war, we saw them periodically, like a couple of times a year, maybe more.</sentence><sentence id="3643">Then we saw them less often, I think, because they moved.</sentence><sentence id="3644">And then I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, so I had no idea where they were, and there was no other contact.</sentence><sentence id="3645">But I did find out through a friend with whom I was talking about the Holocaust one day when I was first in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and I -- I gave her the -- I told her -- she asked me where did I hide, and with whom, so I told her the family was Pavella.</sentence><sentence id="3646">And that was about it.</sentence><sentence id="3647">Then the next day I get a call from this friend.</sentence><sentence id="3648">She said to me, "I didn't want to tell you yesterday, but you're going to receive a telephone call from Many Pavella."</sentence><sentence id="3649">I said, "What?"</sentence><sentence id="3650">She said, "I didn't want to tell you yesterday, because I wasn't sure it was her, but I know the woman.</sentence><sentence id="3651">We work together."</sentence><sentence id="3652">And she apparently called her, and ask her if they were hiding a family by the name of Moudzoukos.</sentence><sentence id="3653">And she said, ""Yes, we were hiding them."</sentence><sentence id="3654">And she said, "Do you remember Paulette?"</sentence><sentence id="3655">And she said, "Paulette, Paulette?</sentence><sentence id="3656">No, that was Paulexani."</sentence><sentence id="3657">That was my name, my false name.</sentence><sentence id="3658">And anyway, she was very excited that I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and wanted to talk to me, and see me.</sentence><sentence id="3659">But my friend, you see, didn't want to disappoint me if this didn't pan out, if -- you know, it wasn't the same person.</sentence><sentence id="3660">And so the next day I got a call from Many, who was just ecstatic, she was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="3661">She wanted to see me, and she wants me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3662">Unfortunately she was leaving for -- she was going to be out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and by the time she would have returned, I was leaving for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3663">But we kept in touch by corresponding, I sent her pictures.</sentence><sentence id="3664">And then the next year I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, my sister and I went to visit her.</sentence><sentence id="3665">We got in touch with them, and we visited them.</sentence><sentence id="3666">And then in "97, I believe, or 98, Many came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3667">She apparently</sentence><sentence id="3669">0 studied in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and I had no idea she was in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, she went to <span class="BUILDING">Purdue University</span>, and I had no idea where she was.</sentence><sentence id="3670">And anyway, she was being honored by Purdue, so then she decided to make a tour around the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and see some of her friends, and when she found out we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, of course I insisted that she comes and stays with us.</sentence><sentence id="3671">So she came and stayed for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="3672">And it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="3673">We remembered all the past stories, and you know, our parents and everything else.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3708">Q: Do they -- did you learn new stories from them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3710">A: Actually, not too many new stories.</sentence><sentence id="3711">What I wanted to know from her is what it was like for them to hide us, and what it meant to them.</sentence><sentence id="3712">And that's what I got mostly.</sentence><sentence id="3713">But she was the only one who knew we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3714">The children, the other two, Booly and Dimitris did not, because of their age.</sentence><sentence id="3715">So she was worried, of course, about you know, when we left in such a hurry.</sentence><sentence id="3716">And they were told that we went with some relatives or something, not clear answers, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3717">So there were so many questions, because you wouldn't get straight answers from adults.</sentence><sentence id="3718">I think at my age anyway, and the younger a -- the younger children, Booly and -- and Dimitris's age.</sentence><sentence id="3719">Because I think people were afraid that, you know, children go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, talk -- I mean they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="3720">They talk to friends, if a friend repeats something like this to a parent, and the parent is suspicious, and then, you know how it goes.</sentence><sentence id="3721">I mean, you had to be careful.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4905">Q: The first new dress in how long, do you think?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4907">A: Oh, four years, five years, some like that.</sentence><sentence id="4908">I used to get Yola's dresses, and my mother would hem them, but you know, there is a 10 year difference, so you can imagine the hem was like</sentence><sentence id="4910">05 another dress almost, plus she would take it in, and my dresses were always kind of loose, and hanging, and I never liked them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4917">Q: That makes me think of the -- a question about how would your f -- parents dress in the time in hiding?</sentence><sentence id="4918">Would they maintain very dignified style of dress, even though clothes would get shabby and well worn?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4921">A: Oh yeah, I mean, I remember my father always wearing a vest, a shirt and a vest, of course no tie in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4922">And my mother always wore a -- a housedress, or a skirt and blouse, some like that.</sentence><sentence id="4923">We didn't have a lot of clothes with us, so when -- since we didn't go out, you know, we didn't need to have anything.</sentence><sentence id="4924">Now that we're talking about clothes, there's something else.</sentence><sentence id="4925">After the war was over, and I think it was after the civil war in "44, there was help that had come from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, you know, in -- relief.</sentence><sentence id="4926">And among them, there was what we used to call <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, UN -- United Nations Relief Agency.</sentence><sentence id="4927">And they were distributing clothes.</sentence><sentence id="4928">So I needed a coat, and my mother took me to get a coat.</sentence><sentence id="4929">So we looked through the different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bins</span>, or thing, and she came up with a brown coat that was down to my ankles, really long, and I didn't like it, but it was wool, and it was warm, and she wanted me to have it, because it was winter.</sentence><sentence id="4930">I cried, and cried and cried, because I just didn't like this coat.</sentence><sentence id="4931">1 wanted something else, but everything else was either too small for me, or too big for me and [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="4932">So finally I ended up having that coat, but here again, she had to hem it to make it approximately my size.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5386">A: I think -- the depression, you know, was -- was -- it was there but not very prominent in the 50's.</sentence><sentence id="5387">I think towards the -- the end of the fift -- probab -- probably after I left, I think things got worse, because also the difficulties with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> became much more.</sentence><sentence id="5388">There were a couple of clients who had big orders, and they cancelled them because they had financial problems and couldn't -- couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="5389">So that, of course, affected our financial situation.</sentence><sentence id="5390">So, I think she got</sentence><sentence id="5392">15 tired, and she just didn't want to fight any more.</sentence><sentence id="5393">And I left in "58, so I'm sure that my leaving was something, you know, difficult for her.</sentence><sentence id="5394">She always hoped to be able to come and visit me, and see me in my new <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5395">She wasn't able to do that, my father's heart condition and diabetes were not doing too well, plus all the financial difficulties, you know, couldn't -- they couldn't afford the trip.</sentence><sentence id="5396">It was that simple.</sentence><sentence id="5397">So I think that certainly made her upset, and unhappy, in addition to everything else.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5657">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="5658">I had an aunt who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and I think my brother-in-law called her to call Isaac, because they didn't know our telephone number in <span class="REGION">California</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5659">And she called Isaac at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to tell him.</sentence><sentence id="5660">They didn't call me direct to tell me.</sentence><sentence id="5661">So Isaac came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> early, and then he asked me to sit down next to him, and he said, "I have to tell you, Mother died."</sentence><sentence id="5662">And when he said Mother died, I thought he was talking about his mother.</sentence><sentence id="5663">And I'm thinking, why is he telling me his mother died, she died, you know, in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5664">Why now he tells me this?</sentence><sentence id="5665">I know, and I said, "I know."</sentence><sentence id="5666">You know, like I was trying to figure it out.</sentence><sentence id="5667">He said, "No, not my mother, your mother died."</sentence><sentence id="5668">But he -- he said nothing about suicide.</sentence><sentence id="5669">He told me that she died, and you know, it was something I just couldn't grasp, I just couldn't get in my head.</sentence><sentence id="5670">So it took me a couple of days to absorb it.</sentence><sentence id="5671">Then I got a letter -- then I called <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5672">And I think it was -- you know, your mind gets kind of blocked in situations like this.</sentence><sentence id="5673">Because I called, and it was after the funeral, so I spoke to my father, and my father said, "We lost Thaliki," -- Thalia was my</sentence><sentence id="5675">21 mother's name.</sentence><sentence id="5676"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thaliki</span> is like a diminutive.</sentence><sentence id="5677">And he said, "We lost Thaliki," and here I'm thinking, you lost her, why don't you look for her?</sentence><sentence id="5678">You know, why don't you go find her, call the police or something.</sentence><sentence id="5679">I didn't tell him that, but that was the thought that went through my mind.</sentence><sentence id="5680">So it was -- it was very differ -- difficult to be that very far away.</sentence><sentence id="5681">And then my sister sent me a letter, I asked her to -- to tell me what happened, and she sent me her -- a long, long letter, with all the details, which I brought it to therapy, and wrote it -- I mean, read it there.</sentence><sentence id="5682">And that was quite earthshaking and w -- and I was trying to avoid reading that in therapy, and -- because the letter is in Greek, so I told my therapist I cannot do it, it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, you want -- Greek, you don't understand anything.</sentence><sentence id="5683">Said, "That's all right, you will translate."</sentence><sentence id="5684">Which of course I did.</sentence><sentence id="5685">It was a very hard session, she cried, too.</sentence><sentence id="5686">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5719">Q: And the distance would be so -- so painful, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5721">A: Oh, it was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="5722">It was -- it was hard, because you know, I couldn't communicate other than a letter that used to take 10 days to arrive.</sentence><sentence id="5723">And phone was not so -- you know, nowadays you can call, and it doesn't cost that much.</sentence><sentence id="5724">Those days, I mean, phone calls to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> were very expensive, and I think we talked a couple of times on the phone, I spoke with my father, with Yola.</sentence><sentence id="5725">And everybody there were thinking how am I gonna cope with being alone here, and not having a support system.</sentence><sentence id="5726">So that was -- then on top of that, two days later, Isaac came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> because he had an interview with Bellcom.</sentence><sentence id="5727">And this was prearranged of course, and that interview was important, so he left and he came here.</sentence><sentence id="5728">And while he was gone, I got a call from a teacher of mine who happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5729">She had no idea my mother died, but she called me just to say hello, and to say how are you doing.</sentence><sentence id="5730">And I'm saying to her -- she's calling from new -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and I'm saying, you know, my mother died, and there are tears coming down [indecipherable] poor woman, I mean, she didn't know what to do over the</sentence><sentence id="5732">22 phone.</sentence><sentence id="5733">So -- but that's -- it was a point of connection with somebody I knew, that I could tell some.</sentence><sentence id="5734">Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5751">Q: Which you needed so desperately, I -- I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5753">A: Right, right, yeah, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="5754">Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5757">Q: You must have thought about this a lot, but do you think there was any connection that we can draw between the Holocaust and your mother's sufferings, hiding, losing almost everything, and her depression and death, or do you think that perhaps -- no, you tell me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5759">A: Well, actually, I don't know, because there are a -- a lot of people who -- who went through the Holocaust and did not commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="5760">So, you cannot pin it just on that.</sentence><sentence id="5761">I think there are many factors that go into something like this.</sentence><sentence id="5762">It's not only one thing.</sentence><sentence id="5763">You cannot say that it was just because of that, but certainly it has played -- I mean, the war and the Holocaust have played a major part in her lowt -- outlook to life.</sentence><sentence id="5764">So, you know, it's not one thing, but it definitely did have something to do with it, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="5765">But here again, there are lots of people who have gone through difficulties, or maybe even harder things, and still are alive.</sentence><sentence id="5766">So, part of it is her make-up, I think.</sentence><sentence id="5767">You know, there isn't a single answer.</sentence><sentence id="5768">There is no single answer, and that's the hardest thing in dealing with that, that you can't find an answer to say, well, I'll pinpoint that this was it.</sentence><sentence id="5769">There isn't.</sentence><sentence id="5770">It's a combination of things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5783">Q: Now you told me about therapy when -- and -- and reading the letter from your sister telling you of your mother's suicide, but what was it that helped you come to terms with it?</sentence><sentence id="5784">Was it just accepting it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5787">A: Yeah, sure.</sentence><sentence id="5788">That it was her decision, although this is not a decision I would choose for myself, because I don't want to leave this kind of legacy to my children.</sentence><sentence id="5789">But here again, I'm a different person, other factors go into my life, so who knows?</sentence><sentence id="5790">I think time has also something to do with</sentence><sentence id="5792">23 it.</sentence><sentence id="5793">Education about the subject has a lot to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="5794">And I really have researched the subject in any possible way.</sentence><sentence id="5795">I once thought of running a group of people who survived the suicide of someone.</sentence><sentence id="5796">And then I decided maybe I wasn't ready to do that, because i have to be a little more detached from it, and I didn't feel I was that detached yet, when I wanted to do the group.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5809">Q: Tell me about the <span class="REGION">areas</span> that you have focused on in your work.</sentence><sentence id="5810">We really -- we've really, in these hours of interviewing, we talked about your early work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span>, and we've mentioned here and there your social work, but we've not addressed it in any detail.</sentence><sentence id="5811">We talked about your interview too, when you were -- before having your first baby, when you might have returned to doing more work then, but so we -- le -- let's go back and have you pick up how you resumed your career, as the girls were growing up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5815">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="5816">Okay, well, as I said, I worked for the International Social Service in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> for a short period of time, a few months, which was a job I liked, and fitted me like a glove, it was perfect, because it was dealing with Greek adoptions, and people I knew from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> I had to communicate with.</sentence><sentence id="5817">Anyway, well after Sarah was born, I did not work any more.</sentence><sentence id="5818">I -- and after the other children were born I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5819">I was involved in Brownies, and maybe <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities and things like that.</sentence><sentence id="5820">Actually I did work in the evenings, when I think Nicole was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, for Garfinkels -- part time -- this was my part time job.</sentence><sentence id="5821">And it was primarily because I needed to do something, and I needed to do something very part time.</sentence><sentence id="5822">But I -- I could start exploring other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5823">But I always wanted to go back to social work, because this was a <span class="DLF">field</span> that always interests me.</sentence><sentence id="5824">I mean, I'm interested in people, and their lives, and what makes them tick, and what's -- how they conduct their lives, what's in their lives, what influence their lives.</sentence><sentence id="5825">So, I had a Bachelor's degree from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, from <span class="BUILDING">Pierce College</span>, which was an <span class="BUILDING">American school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5826">And I knew I couldn't do very much, but when Nicole went to first grade, I -- I thought</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="5830">24 seriously of getting a job in <span class="BUILDING">social work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5831">And somebody told me about the Jewish Social Service in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockville</span>, that they were looking for a social worker at the department of aging, I think.</sentence><sentence id="5832">And I called, and verified that indeed they did need somebody, asked me to send my resume, which I did, and they called me back, they wanted me to go for an interview, which was terrific.</sentence><sentence id="5833">Well, I did go to the interview, but I went a day earlier than the interview was scheduled, like I was not anxious, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="5834">And then I realized when I'm there, because the receptionist looks at [indecipherable] says, "You know, I don't have you down for today.</sentence><sentence id="5835">I think your interview's tomorrow."</sentence><sentence id="5836">I'm protesting, I said, "No, no, it's today at 10 o'clock."</sentence><sentence id="5837">And then I realized I'm wrong, but then I'm thinking if I tell them I'm wrong, they'1l never hire me.</sentence><sentence id="5838">So anyway, the assistant director who was to interview me, Marty Moss was his name, he -- he said to me, "I thought this interview was tomorrow, but anyway since you're here, I have 10 minutes because I have to go into a meeting.</sentence><sentence id="5839">Let's just discuss a few minutes of what is available, and what you can do [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="5840">And maybe we" ll have to have a second interview at one time."</sentence><sentence id="5841">Well, he's telling me that the opening is at the Department of Aging in the Jewish Social Service.</sentence><sentence id="5842">Now, I know nothing about aging.</sentence><sentence id="5843">I've never worked with older people, I don't know what to do with them.</sentence><sentence id="5844">I want to work with children.</sentence><sentence id="5845">Anyway, I said okay.</sentence><sentence id="5846">And then I get a call from the chairperson of the Department of Aging to go for a second interview.</sentence><sentence id="5847">And I'm thinking, do I really want to work with older people?</sentence><sentence id="5848">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="5849">But anyway, it was an <span class="DLF">entrance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5850">So I think the question that really, she asked me, was -- I had done some volunteer work for the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span>, we were doing some kind of a woman's day, and I had chosen the older women, and I had done, you know, some -- a presentation about it, and gathered material, and we had the show, a -- a fashion show for older women, you know, because we felt they were neglected in the fashion, things like that.</sentence><sentence id="5851">Which went very well, actually.</sentence><sentence id="5852">And I was telling her</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="5856">25 about that, and she said, "You'd be perfect for the department".</sentence><sentence id="5857">And I'm thinking, you don't know -- I don't either, I don't know anything.</sentence><sentence id="5858">But anyway, they hired me.</sentence><sentence id="5859">And I was excited, and I thought well, I'll learn.</sentence><sentence id="5860">If I don't like it, I can always leave.</sentence><sentence id="5861">So that was how I started, and once I started working with older people, I just loved it.</sentence><sentence id="5862">I found it so rewarding.</sentence><sentence id="5863">You know, here I was, always wanted to work with children, and now I'm finding the other end of life more interesting, actually, and very rewarding.</sentence><sentence id="5864">So it was great, it was a great team to work with.</sentence><sentence id="5865">It was a good a -- very good agency, very good camaraderie and professionalism.</sentence><sentence id="5866">And I enjoy every minute of it, and I stayed there.</sentence><sentence id="5867">I think I started in "74, and stayed until 1990.</sentence><sentence id="5868">That's a long time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5869">And while I was working there -- I always wanted to do therapy, and I had taken some courses, and then while I was at the Jewish Social Service, the -- my department chair said, "Paulette, you've got to get your Master's degree.</sentence><sentence id="5870">You are doing things that Master's degree social workers are doing, but we can't pay you as a Master's degree social worker."</sentence><sentence id="5871">So finally I thought about it, and thought about it, and I've never been to an <span class="BUILDING">American university</span>, I was 49 years old.</sentence><sentence id="5872">So when I told a friend, I said, "I'm 49, how am I gonna go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="5873">She said, "You'll be 49 whether you go or not, just go."</sentence><sentence id="5874">So finally I talked it over with Isaac, I said I would need a lot of help.</sentence><sentence id="5875">This was a time that Maya had started driving, and she said, "I'll help, I'll help, I'll do all your [indecipherable] driving for you."</sentence><sentence id="5876">So everybody pitched in and I did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5877">They accepted me as an advanced standing student because of my experience with social work.</sentence><sentence id="5878">They waived ce -- certain courses the first semester, and they waived field placement the first semester, because I was still working for the Jewish Social Service part time.</sentence><sentence id="5879">So my first year was much lighter than the other students here.</sentence><sentence id="5880">Second year was harder, I had to -- to quit working for the Jewish Social Service, because I couldn't handle everything, because I did have a field placement, and I had an excellent supervisor.</sentence><sentence id="5881">It was in a <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric clinic</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span></sentence></p><p><sentence id="5884">26 <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric clinic</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Witten</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5885">And I got excellent experience, I had a wonderful supervisor, Meedul Shore.</sentence><sentence id="5886">And of course I had the classes, you know, I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and plus the family.</sentence><sentence id="5887">Sarah was already in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, Maya and Nicole were <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5888">So it was hard writing papers, I've never written a paper in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5889">I mean, I've written papers in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, but they were different.</sentence><sentence id="5890">It was a little hard, because as I said, this was a new experience for me.</sentence><sentence id="5891">I didn't even know how to use the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5892">I had to ask how to use the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5893">It was a lot of work, an awful lot of work, but I loved every minute of it, because I felt I was doing it because I wanted to do it.</sentence><sentence id="5894">And I graduated with a Master's in 1991.</sentence><sentence id="5895">And I went back to the Jewish Social Service, and -- but at the time they had a part time job only available, and they said, "Come, it's part time, if something opens as full time, we'll get you as full time."</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5896">Q: I was

right, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="5900">1991.</sentence><sentence id="5901">And while I was working for the Jewish Social Service, my supervisor at the <span class="BUILDING">community psychiatric clinic</span>, called me one day, and he said, ""You know, there is a psychiatrist who is looking for a social worker to work for him to do intakes.</sentence><sentence id="5902">Are you interested?"</sentence><sentence id="5903">And I said, "I'm interested, but I'm not leaving Jewish Social Service."</sentence><sentence id="5904">So he says, "T'll have him call you."</sentence><sentence id="5905">So he calls me, and he says he's looking for a social worker to do his intakes.</sentence><sentence id="5906">Intakes are, you know, you -- you g -- see the person for the first time, you collect all the information, and then you give it to him, and then he determines the treatment and this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="5907">But it's an elaborate process, I mean, the interviews have to be quite long, and to understand the problem, and this kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="5908">So when he called me, I was leaving for <span class="REGION">Arizona</span> the next day.</sentence><sentence id="5909">It was one of Isaac's retreats.</sentence><sentence id="5910">So I said to him, "I'm leaving for a week."</sentence><sentence id="5911">He said,</sentence><sentence id="5913">27 "Send me your resume, and then we'll talk when you come back."</sentence><sentence id="5914">I came back, he said, "Come and see me."</sentence><sentence id="5915">So I went to see him, we -- he decided to hire me.</sentence><sentence id="5916">So I was working for him part time, and I stayed with him 11 years.</sentence><sentence id="5917">I was working both at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Social Service</span>, and with him.</sentence><sentence id="5918">His name is Aaron Burger, he is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span>, very nice man.</sentence><sentence id="5919">So that was a very good experience, too, because he is a good supervisor also, and a very good -- good

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5944">A: Well, since I was working half time at the Jewish Social Service, actually I would go -- I would work one evening for him, and I would see four or five people, once a week.</sentence><sentence id="5945">Then I would, on my days off from the Jewish Social Service, I would go to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, and see people.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="5946">But he also gave me some people from -- for treatment, some cases that didn't require his skills, you know.</sentence><sentence id="5947">And then, when I quit Jewish Social Service in 1990, because Isaac was retiring, and I -- we were thinking a lot about traveling to Europe and all that kind of stuff, I left Jewish Social Service, and continued working with him for -- until after Ian was born, and then I told him I wanted to spend time with my grandson.</sentence><sentence id="5948">And that was it.</sentence><sentence id="5949">Which he fully understood, and -- because he has grandchildren of his own.</sentence><sentence id="5950">And I'm friends with his wife, and his daughter, we became quite good friends.</sentence><sentence id="5951">So --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5952">Q: How did you feel about your career?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5953">A: I love my career.</sentence><sentence id="5954">And now I'm working -- for awhile I didn't work, after I left Dr. Burger, but then I worked for -- also part time as a contract worker for a company called Aging Network Services, which is located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethesda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5955">They've been in business for 20 years.</sentence><sentence id="5956">It's run by two social workers, and they needed a Master's degree social worker to supervise social workers who do care managers, and do care management.</sentence><sentence id="5957">Coordinating services, and seeing families, and this</sentence><sentence id="5959">28 kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="5960">And I'm still with them, very part time, but I love doing it.</sentence><sentence id="5961">I mean, I -- I do enjoy my career, my career is just the best career for me, anyway.</sentence><sentence id="5962">It's great.</sentence><sentence id="5963">Once I was thinking that I may want to change careers at times, because sometimes people's problems become too big, and you wonder how good you are at it or not, in helping.</sentence><sentence id="5964">But I think this was a phase I had gone through, so I decided to take a catering course, cause I love to cook, and I thought well, maybe I'll do that professionally.</sentence><sentence id="5965">But I did take the course, I got the certificate, I enjoyed the course, but I haven't opened a catering thing.</sentence><sentence id="5966">Isaac wasn't too happy for me to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5983">Q: Maybe you'll -- well, you must have thought about this, but it almost seems as if all these different strands, or yarns, life experiences come together to make you -- or to equip you to do one thing very well.</sentence><sentence id="5984">And maybe you've -- maybe you've -- maybe you see that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5987">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="5988">I think, you know, your past experiences, I mean your history, your past history informs your present, right?</sentence><sentence id="5989">And I think I am who I am because of my past experiences, and my make-up, of course, but yes, I've learned through my experiences.</sentence><sentence id="5990">And I think my work relates very well to my experiences of other people.</sentence><sentence id="5991">Because somebody was asking me what are the major things that you understand about a client.</sentence><sentence id="5992">And I said, "I understand culture, and different culture.</sentence><sentence id="5993">I understand suffering.</sentence><sentence id="5994">I understand hardships.</sentence><sentence id="5995">I understand moving away from a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and from family, and going to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and starting to make a life there.</sentence><sentence id="5996">I understand loneliness, lonesomeness.</sentence><sentence id="5997">I understand raising children, I understand having a husband and working with him, and you know, with his difficulties, and all that kind of stuff."</sentence><sentence id="5998">So I understand these things.</sentence><sentence id="5999">Somehow I -- they come instinctively now.</sentence></p></dialogue>

for the <span class="BUILDING">Aging Network Services</span> is -- is paid work.</sentence><sentence id="6023">I'm a member of WPAS, or Washington Performing Arts Society, the women's committee, and the women's committee has several subcommittees.</sentence><sentence id="6024">And one of the committees I co-chair with another woman, is called Enriching Experiences for Seniors, that started about 10 or 12 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="6025">And what we do is we bring local artists to <span class="BUILDING">senior centers</span>, <span class="BUILDING">nursing homes</span>, assisted livings, <span class="BUILDING">recreation centers</span> for senior adults.</sentence><sentence id="6026">What we do is just we coordinate these things.</sentence><sentence id="6027">You have to coordinate the <span class="BUILDING">center</span>, find the activities director, the date, coordinate the artist, and the days they are available to do this kind of things.</sentence><sentence id="6028">And also provide the volunteers from the women's committee who go to audit the performance, because this way they give us feedback on the artists and the interaction between the -- all the people and the artists, so we" ll know whether to hire them for next year or not.</sentence><sentence id="6029">This is a free program to the community -- I mean, the seniors don't pay anything for this.</sentence><sentence id="6030">WPAS has a budget for the senior program.</sentence><sentence id="6031">And that's what I do in addition to working for the gala, which is a [indecipherable] event, fundraising event, or the auction, or the embassy adoption program, which is another women's committee program, where <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> adopt <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and the -- for the semester, or for the year, and the children study about that particular <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6032">And I usually choose <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6033">So the children -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that chooses <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, I'm the liaison between the two of them.</sentence><sentence id="6034">So we go -- the representative for the <span class="BUILDING">Greek embassy</span>, or the other <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, talk to the children about it.</sentence><sentence id="6035">The children study about <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and work with the teachers, we work with the teachers, and then at the end of the semester, they put up a presentation, the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> invites them for -- for cookies and juice, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="6036">And they give a presentation to</sentence></p><p><sentence id="6039">30 the ambassador, or the staff members of the <span

id="6041">These are sixth graders, they are 12 years old, and they are wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="6042">This -- I mean, 50 <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> participate in this -- in this program, and it's a fantastic program for teachers and children.</sentence><sentence id="6043">The teachers love this program because the children learn so much through that program about the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6044">And it's very educational, it's a fun program, it's just great.</sentence><sentence id="6045">So I love doing <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, as you understand.</sentence><sentence id="6046">Last year there were -- the <span class="BUILDING">Greek embassy</span> was between ambassadors, so they didn't have time to participate in the program, so they were not there.</sentence><sentence id="6047">So I did the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">Bahamas</span>, which was also a nice experience, you know, and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> pretty far away in someplace -- I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">northeast

from the whole class.</sentence><sentence id="6050">It was a good experience.</sentence><sentence id="6051">I mean, to -- to -- somehow I feel that, you know, just doing <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> every year kind of limits me to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, because people tell me wonderful things about the embassy of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, you know, and <span class="COUNTRY">Thailand</span> or other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6052">But I love <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, so I'Il do anything to promote <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and to -- and teach children about it.</sentence><sentence id="6053">There is so

and first son.</sentence><sentence id="6101">There were five children in his family.</sentence><sentence id="6102">His mother was the eldest of seven children.</sentence><sentence id="6103">My grandparents had seven children, two girls.</sentence><sentence id="6104">First one, my paternal grandmother, last one my maternal grandmother, and there were boys in between.</sentence><sentence id="6105">So there were five children in my father's family.</sentence><sentence id="6106">Abusta was the eldest, my father was the second, there were two girls, and Saould, or Sauld was the youngest, who was born in 19 -- I think he was born 1909, or 1910.</sentence><sentence id="6107">So he was like an afterthought.</sentence><sentence id="6108">He was much younger compared to the other siblings

id="6111">My fourth aunt, the fourth child in the family was the only one who survived until 1976, I think.</sentence><sentence id="6112">She came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United

did, and then they decided they wanted to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6118">I mean, the uncle, and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="6119">So they went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and I don't know if it's an official adoption, whether there were papers of adoption taken.</sentence><sentence id="6120">But somehow it seems like the family, or the parents, anyway, decided to -- to let her go with the uncle, because they felt she will have a wonderful life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6121">So she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and she didn't know she was</sentence><sentence id="6123">33 adopted

I had a -- an organza dress, old dress.</sentence><sentence id="6131">And she would send some cans, I mean, chocolates.</sentence><sentence id="6132">And she once sent shoes for my

id="6135">I mean, he couldn't wear them.</sentence><sentence id="6136">And she sended a teddy bear for me.</sentence><sentence id="6137">So I always remember her, you know, for doing these things.</sentence><sentence id="6138">Of course, I met her when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6139">But I mean, she had never met her siblings.</sentence><sentence id="6140">She was in touch with them.</sentence><sentence id="6141">I don't know if she was in touch with them before the war, but after the war, I mean, she came through with sending care packages.</sentence><sentence id="6142">And then, of course, they were corresponding with -- "scuse me -- with my father, and he was the one who would tell the news, you know, t-to

Aseemomeetees.</sentence><sentence id="6145">And there were two daughters and a son, maybe two sons.</sentence><sentence id="6146">And he fell in love with the oldest daughter, and she with him.</sentence><sentence id="6147">Saul was a handsome, beautiful man.</sentence><sentence id="6148">And after the war was over, they kept on seeing each other, and dating each other, and they wanted to get married, but of course she was Christian Orthodox, and the rabbi wouldn't marry them, she had to convert.</sentence><sentence id="6149">So she took all the lessons that she needed to do to convert.</sentence><sentence id="6150">But then there was a little detail which I don't remember now, and they decided they were gonna go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and get married in

Deena knew everything.</sentence><sentence id="6160">And -- but unfortunately, a few months later, in 1950 -- I think they married deg49, or beginning of "50 -- or deg51 I think it was, he got cancer, a brain tumor.</sentence><sentence id="6161">And they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he had surgery and died.</sentence><sentence id="6162">It was terrible.</sentence><sentence

course Deena was totally, totally devastated.</sentence><sentence id="6167">Now, many years later she remarried, but she divorced, this marriage didn't go that well.</sentence><sentence id="6168">Then many years later she married somebody who was living in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>, so -- a -- a -- a Greek, but I think he -- he
