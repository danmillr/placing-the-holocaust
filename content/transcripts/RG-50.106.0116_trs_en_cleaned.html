<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: So the group, when I speak we, I refer to the -- to the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, so to speak.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: They put us on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> and we were traveling.</sentence><sentence id="59">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, all of a sudden we had to stop.</sentence><sentence id="60">And why did we have to stop?</sentence><sentence id="61">Because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the</sentence><sentence id="63"><span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were bombed.</sentence><sentence id="64">This was already 1945, you see, most of the time, to tell you the truth, didn't know exactly when, what time it was.</sentence><sentence id="65">But later we found out that the war was getting -- was almost of the brink of being finished, except we didn't realize.</sentence><sentence id="66">But when we stopped at our -- in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were bombed, we couldn't go -- excuse me -- much farther.</sentence><sentence id="67">So what had happened, while we were waiting there for repairs, the SS had this speech to us, he said hey, you ought to be very happy, because this is April 20", 1945, it's Hitler's birthday.</sentence><sentence id="68">And we, we were thinking why in the hell should we be happy that it's Hitler's birthday?</sentence><sentence id="69">But of course he said we will give you an extra piece of bread to celebrate it.</sentence><sentence id="70">And no sooner did he finish as the whole <span class="DLF">sky</span> became black and we were actually bombed.</sentence><sentence id="71">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were hit by the allies.</sentence><sentence id="72">Not direct, but next to it.</sentence><sentence id="73">And actually, we were like about 3,000 women, probab -- [coughs] excuse me -- probab --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: You want a cough drop?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: No, I--I am using a--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="95">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: Probably a thousand of us got killed by the bombs, and the rest of us, when this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> split open, and we saw like an <span class="DLF">opening</span>, the ones who were able to, we just ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">We hid out.</sentence><sentence id="99">We couldn't stay there too long, because after all, they didn't give us that extra piece of bread, so we couldn't do a -- hide out too much,</sentence><sentence id="101">and we finally came out and we spotted this Russian -- he was like a -- probably like a colonel in the army.</sentence><sentence id="102">And we ran over to him and he said, don't worry, you are free.</sentence><sentence id="103">And that's how we actually were liberated, which was already like not exactly April 20", because it took us like two days longer.</sentence><sentence id="104">But apparently, the Russians were already there.</sentence><sentence id="105">I always say, had the Germans left us in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we probably would have been liberated by the Americans, because I think where we were liberated was almost very near where the Americans and the Russians met, near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe river</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Excuse me, that makes a sound.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Oh yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="123">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="124">So anyhow, that was mine liberation.</sentence><sentence id="125">So what do you do after you were liberated?</sentence><sentence id="126">You know, we had thru -- in a way, we had a chance, because we could have -- and the Russians were encouraging us to go on a rampage, you know.</sentence><sentence id="127">The Germans killed us, you go out, you have a chance now, kill the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="128">But you know what?</sentence><sentence id="129">We decided this wasn't our way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: Wh-When they were telling you to do this, how did they --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: The Russians?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Yeah, did you have weapons to --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: No, we didn't have weapons, but we could have gotten -- they would have been delighted to give us a -- one of their guns.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: The Russians would have?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: Yeah, they would have, but --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: So they would have helped you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Definitely.</sentence><sentence id="154">But we decided ourselves that's no way to go, and we just figured because we didn't like what they were doing to us, we would turn around doing the same thing to them.</sentence><sentence id="155">After all, the German that I would have picked up, I probably would have never -- had never seen him before.</sentence><sentence id="156">It would have been just picking up a German because he was German.</sentence><sentence id="157">And it -- this wasn't our way.</sentence><sentence id="158">And the next thing what we started doing is let's go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">Let's try to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: N-Now when you say we, were -- who -- where -- did you have special friends that you were with?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: We kind of got -- when we were liberated, because we were so used to always being in groups, like I didn't know how to be by myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="173">A: I-It-- so like about 15 girls, we got together and we like di-- did things together.</sentence><sentence id="174">If we wanted to get some bread -- because we didn't have like what the Americans did on the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> where they fed you.</sentence><sentence id="175">With the</sentence><sentence id="177">Russians you didn't have anything like this.</sentence><sentence id="178">The only thing what they did for you, we would go to them and say take -- let's go to a <span class="BUILDING">German bakery</span> with us.</sentence><sentence id="179">And they would go with us and they would requisition from the baker, bread for us.</sentence><sentence id="180">So we -- and we, our type of eating was very crude.</sentence><sentence id="181">Bread and water, that's all we needed, you know, to keep us alive.</sentence><sentence id="182">So that's what we got, we got mostly bread and water.</sentence><sentence id="183">Because even when we got into a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span>, even if we saw some food there, you know, because what was happening after the war, a lot of <span class="BUILDING">German households</span> became empty.</sentence><sentence id="184">Why?</sentence><sentence id="185">Because the Germans were afraid of the Russians and they were running towards the <span class="REGION">American zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">So they left a lot of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> with no one there.</sentence><sentence id="187">So when we would go in, we would find maybe some food over there.</sentence><sentence id="188">I remember in one <span class="NPIP">place</span>, they had to spe -- these beautiful, you know, like fruits, apples and cherries put in in jars, like we put away sometimes fruits.</sentence><sentence id="189">We were afraid to eat them because we thought that maybe they poisoned it.</sentence><sentence id="190">So we wouldn't even touch this.</sentence><sentence id="191">But we would have the bread from the baker and the water and that's how we continued going towards <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: Now, you would ask a Russian to requisition bread for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yeah, a Russian soldier.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="217">Were all the Russian soldiers helpful to you, or --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="225">A: Mos-Most of the time yes.</sentence><sentence id="226">You see, they didn't have this type o-of gan -- organization like they had with the -- the Americans had.</sentence><sentence id="227">You know, what the Americans did, they found the survivors, they put them in into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they supplied food and you had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to put down your head.</sentence><sentence id="228">With the Russians you had nothing like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="233">Q: But some Russians in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> were abusive to --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: To women.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: To women, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="236">A: Definitely.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="237">Q: -- did you encounter any of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: A--well, we learned to -- to kind of counteract that.</sentence><sentence id="240">Let's put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="241">During the day, ess -- you know, I told you, we were 15 girls of us.</sentence><sentence id="242">As a matter of fact, we took out from one of these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, a horse and one of those -- it was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> -- not a co -- you know, a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: But it's not a b -- it wasn't a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, it was like the most beautiful si -- here at the <span class="BUILDING">Smithsonian</span> | walked in one time, in front was sitting this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span>, you know, it was the most gorgeous thing if I would have kept it and would -- wouldn't have to had to worry about any finances because it probably was worth at -- a fortune.</sentence><sentence id="250">But we were</sentence><sentence id="252">traveling in this horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="253">During the day, let's say where we -- if we were in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> during the day, we would split up a little bit and go into different <span class="NPIP">places</span> to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="254">Like we would sleep where the horses would sleep in -- in some kind of -- what do they call them, the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span>, like.</sentence><sentence id="255">Or the pigs, or some others, because we were actually very much afraid of -- of raping, because during the war, you see, i-in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I never worried about being raped by a German, because this was something that they were not allowed to do.</sentence><sentence id="256">If--if a German got caught raping a Jewish girl, he was in trouble.</sentence><sentence id="257">So they usually stayed away from us.</sentence><sentence id="258">They probably were raping more German women.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: What -- what was that about, that they were not allowed to rape Jewish women?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Oh, that's was the -- what they called the rassenschande.</sentence><sentence id="273">Rassen, the race, schande is the -- a-- you know, shame.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Shame.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: The -- the -- the race shame, you know, otherwise you -- you like committed the worst sin.</sentence><sentence id="279">I mean, you commit a sin when you rape anybody, but this, th -- it wasn't the raping that they were worried.</sentence><sentence id="280">So after the war we did have to -- the women, and I don't -- we got away -- we got away kind of lucky, but a lot of women weren't that lucky.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="284">Q: It sounds as though you also were careful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Very, very, as I say.</sentence><sentence id="291">You see, when I was liberated in "45, I was already almost like 19 years old.</sentence><sentence id="292">You know, through the war years, you became very adept, let's put it this way, and like self preservation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="298">A: So most of us were really looking out for these things.</sentence><sentence id="299">When we notice in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that there were Russian soldiers, too many Russian soldiers, that they might go out on-- you know, at night, looking for women, we didn't stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">We would march on.</sentence><sentence id="301">We - like I said, we had this horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, so we could move on a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="302">And also, we met some Italian guys who must have been working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">You know, they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work.</sentence><sentence id="304">And they were also like trying to get back.</sentence><sentence id="305">So sometimes, you see, the Russians, if they saw you with a -- with another man, they would just stay away from you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="316">A: So we, during the day, we would like, if we were visible, we would go with them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: The Italian guys.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="321">And then we just lost them.</sentence><sentence id="322">Came to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we looked around what was bat -- we were very much aware, and I'm really surprised -- you probably heard from other people because you the first one ever asking me really, that</sentence><sentence id="324">question, how -- because we were -- were a lot afraid of being raped by the Russian soldiers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="331">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="333">A: So anyhow, after -- to tell you the truth, how long it took us to get to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>, I really don't know, but I figure that it must have taken us like about three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="334">First of all, when we were liberated, there was one friend that was very -- from the bombs, she was a little bit more in -- and sh-she -- you know, like she lost a couple fingers and she was more troubled than most of us.</sentence><sentence id="335">You know, like I had a little bit of a i-injury, you know, like a shrapnel?</sentence><sentence id="336">A piece of shrapnel got into my hand, but it wasn't -- you know, I never felt it.</sentence><sentence id="337">You know, it wasn't dangerous for me.</sentence><sentence id="338">But with her, we had to put her in in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">So she actually stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">We couldn't, you see, we couldn't keep on staying in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for too long because we were actually afraid of this.</sentence><sentence id="341">So we actually had to leave her in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but there was another friend that she met that stayed with her.</sentence><sentence id="342">So she was like more or less taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="343">But we kept on going and probably took us probably like about three weeks til we got to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">And when I got there -- and you know, as you were walking -- you see, when we were liberated, would you believe that most of us didn't realize that most of our families were murdered?</sentence><sentence id="345">We still were hoping that maybe somebody's gonna be alive because I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="348">Interview with Regina Spiegel (c) May 11, 1999 will tell you, in a way maybe that was good, because that's what kept us through all the other times, kept us going, because if not we probably at one time or another, we would have given up.</sentence><sentence id="349">But that was, in a way, kept us -- hey, you stay alive because you promised that we're gonna meet at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="350">You know, like my boyfriend told me, you know, on the last, when they were separate -- when they separated us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> he said to me, if we stay alive, just remember, meet me in mine <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">But also, he didn't know that my mother told me this, when we were, you know, it was just practically in the beginning of the war when she got us all together and she said, just remember, if God forbid we should get separated -- you see, never thinking that what's going to happen, that it's going to be this mass killing, but just separated.</sentence><sentence id="352">If we go, maybe I was someplace else or something, she says, remember, after the war, we'll meet in our <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you know, in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">So naturally, the first thing what I wanted to do is get back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="354">So I did.</sentence><sentence id="355">That's how --and most of us --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.416666" long="21.15">Radom</span>, but by the time when I hit the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>, it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Poznan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">That was like on germ -- <span class="DLF">Polish German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="359">I don't know whether -- you know, I think it's not any more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span>, I think they call it now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span>, because this became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, you know, ne -- I think so they call it</sentence><sentence id="361"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span>, I'm almost sure.</sentence><sentence id="362">Or maybe it's still there, I haven't looked at the map.</sentence><sentence id="363">Maybe after I finish this interview I will take a look at the map.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="372">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="374">A: But we got to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Poznan</span>, and when | got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were running already.</sentence><sentence id="375">Because you see, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was actually liberated in deg44, towards the end of "44, th -- it-- the beginning of "45.</sentence><sentence id="376">So their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were already running.</sentence><sentence id="377">They weren't maybe bombed as much, because they weren't bombed by the allies, the allies [indecipherable] had lots of bombs.</sentence><sentence id="378">And I dropped -- I will never forget this, I drove -- I --I didn't drive, how do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="379">I brought this horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and left it there just like that because actually, we were 15 girls, no one wanted to go near the horse.</sentence><sentence id="380">I said to them, you went through such a war.</sentence><sentence id="381">You're afraid of a little horse?</sentence><sentence id="382">I mean, he was that -- he probably w-wa -- I wish all through the war I would have had the dealing with the horse and -- other than with the people.</sentence><sentence id="383">I said, and you're afraid?</sentence><sentence id="384">So they were afraid to go near the horse, so I was the one that fed the horse, I was the one that took him in -- now I probably wouldn't know how to deal with it, but at the time, you know, when your life is at stake, or whatever it is that you have, I came to the conclusion that human nature, you would do what you have to do for survival.</sentence></p></dialogue>
