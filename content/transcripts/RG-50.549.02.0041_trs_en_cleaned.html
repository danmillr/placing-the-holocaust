<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: He also did not expect to see you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="60">Maybe three days later, two policemen came looking for me, and my father said, "Yes, he is here."</sentence><sentence id="61">And he brought them in and he uncovered me, said, "Do you want to take him like that?"</sentence><sentence id="62">And I think I weighed about 78 pounds.</sentence><sentence id="63">And one of them knew me because I was a star swimmer, and they told my father, "Nevermind, we're going to say that -- that he was not here."</sentence><sentence id="64">So they left and then we accommodate -- accommodate ourself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe three days later, my father, upon my mother's suggestion, tried to find a doctor who assured my parents that there was no hope.</sentence><sentence id="66">So a priest was called, who gave me the last sacraments, and -- but obviously I didn't die.</sentence><sentence id="67">And then when the Americans marched in, I think it was April the 12", my father went to see the commanding officer, told him about me and they came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military ambulance</span>, and took me to a <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company, and I was with them, ooh, for quite some time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="77">Q: How far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diisseldorf</span>, from your parents, were you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Oh, three <span class="DLF">blocks</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="81">Q: Oh, that's wonderful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="83">A: Yeah, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was kind of --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: So the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was taken over then, by Americans?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Yes.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="88"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0041 5</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="89">Q: And did you say that there was a Jewish man in charge, a doctor?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: Yes, Major Hermann.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="92">Q: And one of the questions that I wanted to ask you is -- is a long time sort of prospective from the post-war to the present time is, from here, from this doctor, have you experienced prejudice because you are a German in certain circumstances, and if so, where?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="94">A: Oh well, once with Major Hermann.</sentence><sentence id="95">We didn't -- It didn't mean enough to him that I had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="96">I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="97">After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you.</sentence><sentence id="98">So I traveled through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as a Frenchman.</sentence><sentence id="99">I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="100">So, except -- until when I came to <span class="REGION">South America</span>, which is about as pro- German as you can get, in any part of <span class="REGION">South America</span>, and quite anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="101">So as a German, no, except for the -- the -- the time immediately after the war in other <span class="REGION">European countries</span>, where I didn't dare say that I was German, other than that no, I had -- there were no repercussions because of my heritage, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: I want to go back to your being in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and three blocks away and how long you were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and did you see your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: Yeah, my parents came from time to time and I remember that I gained, oh sometimes as much as a pound and a half a day.</sentence><sentence id="113">And one day the American doctor told me that my</sentence><sentence id="115">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 6 heart would not support so much gain of weight and that I had to get up and I thought that was a bad joke.</sentence><sentence id="116">But I remember h-he telling me that I had to jump on one leg 13 times and then on the other one, where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> and I would do sketches of the Gls.</sentence><sentence id="117">And then, maybe it was two or three months later, I walked with this cane and I was released and I was then with my parents.</sentence><sentence id="118">And Americans, shortly thereafter, were replaced by the British.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="126">Q: In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="128">A: No, not in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, as occupation troop.</sentence><sentence id="129">The -- The -- si -- The <span class="REGION">American military zone</span> -- part of the <span class="REGION">American military zone</span> became British.</sentence><sentence id="130">They -- They re-divided <span class="REGION">geographic areas</span>, where the Americans stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and so on and the British used another part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and of course the Russians took all of <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: You had quite a -- a rich life since, which is why I wanted to start here, and I also had a question, although I understand that you were a person who loved adventure, I wondered how long you stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and why did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: Situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was rather unbearable, <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span>, one German would denounce another German for being a member of the Nazi party, for having done this or that.</sentence><sentence id="137">The entire <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was destroyed, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Diisseldorf</span> 75 percent.</sentence><sentence id="138">There didn't seem to be a future.</sentence><sentence id="139">Money did not exist, it was bartering.</sentence><sentence id="140">Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering.</sentence><sentence id="141">My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="142">My mother continuously cried.</sentence><sentence id="143">So it was a period of depression and even though at</sentence><sentence id="145">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 7 that time it was an impossibility to leave, you couldn't leave -- you couldn't go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> after 10 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="146">But somehow I flirted with the idea of going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">And anybody with whom I would have shared the idea would have declared me insane.</sentence><sentence id="148">I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">And I didn't know that much about the difference of <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="REGION">North America</span>, to me <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="150">I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, "Where do you want to go, eventually?" "</sentence><sentence id="151">Well," I said, "<span class="COUNTRY">America</span>." "</sentence><sentence id="152">What part of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="153">And I said <span class="REGION">North America</span> just to give him an answer.</sentence><sentence id="154">He said, "Well, I'm very sorry, but my family has an <span class="DLF">estate</span> in -- close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>."</sentence><sentence id="155">Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave.</sentence><sentence id="156">Said, "You know that's impossible."</sentence><sentence id="157">Well, I said, "I'm going to try."</sentence><sentence id="158">And he said that, "If I didn't know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there's no need for me to say anything.</sentence><sentence id="159">All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you're going to have a very pleasant surprise."</sentence><sentence id="160">That was his advice.</sentence><sentence id="161">I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, knowing that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in <span class="REGION">rural areas</span>, which happened to be the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends.</sentence><sentence id="163">And going to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> was quite an adventure and I went to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> several times.</sentence><sentence id="164">And that itself is quite a story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Was this the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="197">A: <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="200"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0041 8</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: And that meant that the Russians were in charge of everything [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: They were the occupying force, and they were terrible.</sentence><sentence id="208">So, we're -- going to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> was in itself something like going to a <span class="REGION">foreign country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">I had gone there twice, so I figured that somehow I sh -- I should be able to go.</sentence><sentence id="210">I had an address of a relative of a friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="218">Q: What was your motive for going?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Oh, I was sick and tired of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, of the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, thought there must be better places in the world then, than corruption, <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span>, degeneration, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: So you said goodbye to your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Well, I didn't say, excuse me, I didn't say goodbye, I told my mother that I was going to a water polo championship, and she said, "There's nothing like that."

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Oh, yeah, I -- I -- no, I told that to her because she would not have allowed me to</sentence></p><p><sentence id="244">leave, and I didn't want her to cry.</sentence><sentence id="245">So I stow away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Achen</span>, which is right on the <span class="DLF">border</span>,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="246">and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me that I gave to a railroad employee, and I</sentence></p><p><sentence id="247">asked him -- I spoke to him with a French accent and I told him that I had been in</sentence></p><p><sentence id="248"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a French prisoner of war and that I'd fallen in love with a German girl and</sentence></p><p><sentence id="249">I'd come to see her and I needed to go back.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I wondered whether he could help me,</sentence></p><p><sentence id="253">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0041 9 whether there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going across.</sentence><sentence id="254">He told me about a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo train</span> and well, I hid in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo train</span> and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">I went to see an old farmer.</sentence><sentence id="256">Matter of fact, I visited the farmer's son last year.</sentence><sentence id="257">And he told me, "Don't come up, they're looking for Germans all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="258">Q: How did he know you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: He didn't know me.</sentence><sentence id="260">I told him who I was.</sentence><sentence id="261">He was the cousin or nephew of a lady in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">You have to underst --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: Oh, sorry.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="264">A: -- You have to understand the situation.</sentence><sentence id="265">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border towns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, they were German during the Kaiser.</sentence><sentence id="266">After the Kaiser, they -- they became <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">Hitler took it back, and after Hitler lost, they returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">So those <span class="REGION">areas</span>, like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span>, they all speak German and they're probably more German than Belgian, or Germ -- [indecipherable] so anyway, he gave me some sandwich, an apple, and told me that I should wait for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">milk truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">It took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">Well, at -- at noon time, I was in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> and I stayed a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, visiting with a friend of my father.</sentence><sentence id="271">Then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and eventually I became a sailor.</sentence><sentence id="272">That went on until December of "48, when I stow awayed on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch freighter</span> and went to <span class="REGION">South America</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
