<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="691">A: In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="692">So that made everybody conscious and clear who it is and who isn't.</sentence><sentence id="693">The heavily populated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish areas</span> are almost homogeneously Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="694">Ours was not, we were a bit farther away from the massive Jewish concentration of Jasi.</sentence><sentence id="695">But our <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> had still a majority of Jewish people, even though our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was very close to the most important chur -- <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> in -- in Iasi, the Mitropolea, Mitropolea, which was a very important, the most important religious place, Christian religious place.</sentence><sentence id="696">So this explains my reference, Joan.</sentence></p></dialogue>

in those days.</sentence><sentence id="1746">And this was a report sent by the local unit of that special service to their superiors, as an accomplishment.</sentence><sentence id="1747">I couldn't give you my own opinion, I don't have a number, but I know how many I saw myself.</sentence><sentence id="1748">But this is a total number, so they kept numbers also on the people who survived from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, and people who were unloaded.</sentence><sentence id="1749">But I can again say that I saw in this -- in the 90's, when I was able again to travel to <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1867">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1869">A: So this is -- it was -- later when we -- some of the people who remained alive, send messages where they are, and their families went and contacted, and tried to find out whether their own relatives were among the survivors.</sentence><sentence id="1870">One arrived in some wha -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calarasi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And another, which was farther away, another was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portleroi</span> which was closer and easier from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iasi</span> to travel there.</sentence><sentence id="1872">And you know, there was an unending waiting, and when people came back, family members,</sentence><sentence id="1874">4 and were -- got the news that their father, or their brother, or their son didn't make it, was killed, and others was all right, no, you know, that -- you know, Sroul Abramovitch died.</sentence><sentence id="1875">I know for sure because he died in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And the other died, and I know when his body was -- was thrown down.</sentence><sentence id="1877">So they found -- they got the certainty of having lost those people forever.</sentence><sentence id="1878">So it was a continuous awareness of that pogrom.</sentence></p></dialogue>

believe, "42, and one month, two months later, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="2213">There was evidence of who are the Jews, but nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="2214">At the same time, which was a very important factor, the Romanian army was victorious.</sentence><sentence id="2215">It was far away, deep into the Soviet Union, and -- and there was a -- a -- a sense of triumph

books.</sentence><sentence id="2242">It wasn't proper equipment for children, that was made for ad-adults, but I remember very well how we learned.</sentence><sentence id="2243">We had teachers and we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2244">We had breaks, you know, we played in the breaks and a bit of normalcy seeped in.</sentence><sentence id="2245">And this was end of "42 - "43, and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> happened, and then we became happy, and the Romanians, and the others people there started to understand that the war is turning.</sentence><sentence id="2246">And since [indecipherable] and casualties were on the <span class="REGION">Romanian side</span> pretty severe -- very severe in fact, because the Germans put always the Romanian troops and regiments in the -- in the fire, you know, in the most dangerous, and there were many casualties and losses.</sentence><sentence id="2247">So the situation turned generally grim, but we were able to -- to learn about what is happening, and some hope started to -- to come up, that the Germans are going to be defeated, and the war is going to be turned around.</sentence><sentence id="2248">So that gave us a bit of hope, our hope grew.</sentence><sentence id="2249">The situation generally didn't worsen, and it didn't worsen for Jews as it was -- became apparent much later, I did not have any way myself</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2253">6 to learn that, but for the overall picture it appeared that the politicians, including the government, Antonescu, realized sooner than we did that the war is turning and then the risk of being -- killing the Jews is 10 times as high because they may be a -- become accountable.</sentence><sentence id="2254">So the -- the state's anti-Semite activities did not grow, or did not expand their -- I am not aware of any other massacre or pogrom, or further very severe -- I don't recall my father being called again in "43 to -- to do forced labor and now I understand, I mean there are documents which show that the -- the government wanted to -- to change course.</sentence><sentence id="2255">They send also representatives on the sly to contact the allies, without <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> knowing.</sentence><sentence id="2256">And that was "43, in 44 <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> turned sides already.</sentence><sentence id="2257">So for us the situation was better on that.</sentence><sentence id="2258">Still fear, still Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2259">We had an episode of wearing the yellow star in the period of "41, I don't recall in -- exactly how long, but I still have the yellow star and -- two yellow stars, in fact.</sentence><sentence id="2260">One was also exhibited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and -- which were mine, my -- my mother kept that too, which were sewn on garments when we had to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and stayed on the garments except that if we had to change the garments, we had to move those things.</sentence><sentence id="2261">So there was -- that situation of living between how do you I say it, one fear and the other, and one hope and another hope.</sentence><sentence id="2262">Until -- but then, you know, the -- the sense of hope and the sense of possible escape started to soon -- rather s-soon to disappear again because the Russians were successful in pushing the Germans and the Romanian armies back.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2263">And that increased the -- for us, th-the sense of fear that if they are defeated, and if they are going to retreat, we can be again in great jeopardy, and another massacre may occur when the armies will be here.</sentence><sentence id="2264">That was one -- one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2265">The other thing which happened in that - those years, is news percolated to us that our relatives were deported, or -- but some of them may be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2266">Not -- not specifically was about our
