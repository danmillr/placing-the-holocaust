<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: When were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in mid 1935, so I am just about 55 years old now, and that made me 6 years old in 1941 when the Germans came in.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Before the Germans came in, what do you remember of your very early years and I guess when the Russians came in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="18">I remember a pretty happy sort of carefree childhood.</sentence><sentence id="19">Although it turned out we were not rich.</sentence><sentence id="20">In fact we were quite poor for a certain reason that happened earlier which is germane to this story.</sentence><sentence id="21">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> is a beautiful scenic area.</sentence><sentence id="22">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">People came there for vacations.</sentence><sentence id="24">It's well known as a vacation spot.</sentence><sentence id="25">I remember people talking about...oh, this famous person came and that person came and so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="26">So it's a beautiful <span class="REGION">area</span> on two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="27">With <span class="DLF">bridges</span> across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as we call it.</sentence><sentence id="28">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">Roughly half Jewish and half mostly Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="30">Maybe 5,000 people altogether, about 2,000 Jews in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">And there was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">It was a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish area</span> was sort of by itself but not any significant amount of anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="34">The Jews and the Poles got along reasonably well together which is unusual.</sentence><sentence id="35">And I remember it as a happy <span class="NPIP">place</span> and an enjoyable <span class="NPIP">place</span> with games and playing and running by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and all kinds of adventures or misadventures.</sentence><sentence id="36">Stuff like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Tell me about your parents.</sentence><sentence id="58">What did your father do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="62">My father was in business similar to his father in dealing with buying grain from farmers and reselling it, so he was a grain merchant he would call it.</sentence><sentence id="63">A total of seven brothers and sisters that he had, so I am dealing here on his side an extended family.</sentence><sentence id="64">They were all married.</sentence><sentence id="65">He was one of the youngest in the family so we're dealing with an extended family about 50 odd people.</sentence><sentence id="66">And my mother's family, she had a sister there.</sentence><sentence id="67">That's all because they were quasi-recent immigrants having been displaced during World</sentence><sentence id="69">War | and they came to this <span class="REGION">area</span> after that but my father's family had lived there for many, many years so my mother's family was more scattered and the rest of her family was in different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">In fact, one sister was in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.516666" long="26.183333">Soly</span>, which helped us out later.</sentence><sentence id="71">But my father's family comes from an old Misnagid [non-chassidik] family .The whole <span class="REGION">area</span> was Misnagid because of the Wilner Gaon and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="72">And my grandfather, Alav haShalom [may he rest in peace] was a very very staunch you might say stern type individual, but a very honorable person who believed in doing everything by the book if I can say it that way.</sentence><sentence id="73">Well known individual who paid for it in a certain way, but the Nazis when they came in they usually picked on somebody who they considered the leader of the community.</sentence><sentence id="74">I don't know why they picked on my grandfather because he was not the Rav [rabbi] but we have eye witness accounts that he was the one picked on.</sentence><sentence id="75">They beat him.</sentence><sentence id="76">They ripped his beard out, and they blinded him before they shot him.</sentence><sentence id="77">So that was not a good way to end your life at the age of 81.</sentence><sentence id="78">But he also was a grain merchant, but when I knew him he was very, very, very poor because something happened 20 years prior to that that made him poor.</sentence><sentence id="79">And that's an important story I have to tell you because that's what saved our life.</sentence><sentence id="80">It happened that he used to buy and sell grain from the local farmers.</sentence><sentence id="81">Local farmers in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were very poor.</sentence><sentence id="82">They were sharecroppers because the primary ownership of land in this feudal society in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was from the large landowners a form of nobility.</sentence><sentence id="83">However, there was one farmer who for some strange means had acquired his own <span class="REGION">land</span> and acquired a little bit of a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he was considered rich by those standards.</sentence><sentence id="84">And my grandfather used to do a lot of business with this man.</sentence><sentence id="85">One day it seems 15 years before the war or something like that, Grandfather decided that the way to...to really go was to become not only a merchant but a miller because the real money to be made was in turning the grain into flour.</sentence><sentence id="86">There were three <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, all water-operated <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">When one <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> became available, he decide to buy it.</sentence><sentence id="88">And so he bought this <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> and he spent everything he had...everything he could borrow to buy this <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> and he had no money to buy grain.</sentence><sentence id="89">So he went to this particular farmer with whom he had dealt many times before and he made an agreement that he would buy the grain on credit.</sentence><sentence id="90">I don't know what the deal was, how much extra he paid him, but the farmer trusted him and he sold him the grain on credit.</sentence><sentence id="91">And the grain came in and it was put into the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">It was all filled up and then according to the story apparently it was arson but nobody proved anything because the idea was the other two millers were jealous because they were afraid that he would become too much of a competitor.</sentence><sentence id="93">The <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> caught fire and it was on the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="94">And it was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and people could have put it out.</sentence><sentence id="95">They started to put it out, but my grandfather came out and he said, "There is nobody in there.</sentence><sentence id="96">No lives are involved.</sentence><sentence id="97">You will not put it out.</sentence><sentence id="98">It's Sabbath."</sentence><sentence id="99">And he forbade them to put out this fire and the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and all the grain with it.</sentence><sentence id="100">So he was bankrupt and he owed this farmer for all the grain.</sentence><sentence id="101">Now the farmer could have probably taken him to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> or something, but I don't know what he could have done.</sentence><sentence id="102">In any event, my grandfather then walked about 20 miles or whatever the distance was to the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span>, the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he told the farmer that he would pay him back everything no matter how long it took.</sentence><sentence id="103">And it took something like 10, 15 years.</sentence><sentence id="104">Everything he had, everything</sentence><sentence id="106">he could get, and there were some...there was a son in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who sent money <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">Everything the family went to this farmer to pay back for the grain.</sentence><sentence id="108">That's why the family was poor.</sentence><sentence id="109">Now, the critical issue is that after the Germans came in we escaped.</sentence><sentence id="110">Many Jews escaped.</sentence><sentence id="111">Those who had no money they usually did not survive because they couldn't pay anybody and people were not that altruistic because it was very, very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="112">Those who had money they did not survive either because eventually they came in contact with somebody who killed them for their money because it was very easy to kill a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="113">There were no penalties whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="114">So anybody who wanted to kill a Jew and take their money, they just did it.</sentence><sentence id="115">We had no money.</sentence><sentence id="116">Nobody would kill us for our money.</sentence><sentence id="117">But what we had is the honor of the family that spent 15 years paying off.</sentence><sentence id="118">And this farmer's sons hid my father with the belief that if we survived they would be rewarded, and they knew that he meant it.</sentence><sentence id="119">So through this <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> that burned down and my grandfather spending 15 years paying this farmer and his sons knowing that my father was the son of this man, they were willing to take the chance.</sentence><sentence id="120">So in a way he was paid for letting this thing burn down because he said you do not do work on Sabbath. (</sentence><sentence id="121">Long Pause) There's a reason for everything.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: Indeed.</sentence><sentence id="189">Alright.</sentence><sentence id="190">Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="191">Let us go back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="198">Q: Let us go back to when the Russians came "39.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: Tell us what you remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="204">A: I remember that extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="205">I was standing by the <span class="DLF">road</span> and my mother was screaming at me to come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and it was the most fascinating sight that I had ever seen.</sentence><sentence id="206">This is a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span>, not even paved, you understand.</sentence><sentence id="207">When we say <span class="DLF">roads</span> it was the place where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> went, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And I had never seen more than one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> per month before and here were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored carriers</span>, whatever, going for hours and hours on end.</sentence><sentence id="209">Non-stop!</sentence><sentence id="210">And I just couldn't understand it.</sentence><sentence id="211">I didn't understand where these things came from.</sentence><sentence id="212">It was like magic, and it was just so fascinating to stand by the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the dust and these things rumbling and making noises and so forth and finally she came and snatched me away because she thought it was dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="213">It wasn't dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="214">These people weren't doing anything.</sentence><sentence id="215">And they seemed to be going on for days.</sentence><sentence id="216">It wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="217">I am sure it was hours, but it seemed as if there were millions and millions of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> just non-stop continually going and going and going and going.</sentence><sentence id="218">And the Russians came and took over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and russified it or whatever the right word is.</sentence><sentence id="219">They changed the administration.</sentence><sentence id="220">A lot of people were rounded up and sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, the so-called wealthy and the landowners and the anti-communists and</sentence><sentence id="222">whoever they feared.</sentence><sentence id="223">Our life didn't change much because we were not rich to start with, as I told you the story and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="224">And we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but that didn't make us into landowners.</sentence><sentence id="225">And life went on as before, and no significant changes of any kind except there was a lot of tension, the fear.</sentence><sentence id="226">You could sense different behaviors.</sentence><sentence id="227">Of course, there were stories which I didn't understand at the time about the atrocities in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, in the German occupied part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">There were refugees that were coming through telling horrifying stories that nobody believed.</sentence><sentence id="229">I mean it couldn't possibly be that bad, you know, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="230">But on the whole, it continued to be peaceful and most of what I remember of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...in fact, about what it looked like and...and it's beauty and so forth I think is more from that time than before "39 because I was very young, only 4 years old in "39.</sentence><sentence id="231">It's hard to remember precisely.</sentence><sentence id="232">There is one memory that I am certain is before "39 because I fell into something, almost got killed, but anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="233">It was a childhood accident.</sentence><sentence id="234">But otherwise, the Russians didn't do anything to us, but there were various changes in the atmosphere which was more of World War II than the Russians themselves.</sentence><sentence id="235">And then in 1941 in June very suddenly...it happened very quickly as I assume it happened everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="236">The Russians were there one day, and then they weren't there.</sentence><sentence id="237">There was hardly any fighting.</sentence><sentence id="238">There was no front.</sentence><sentence id="239">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="240">All of a sudden there were no Russians and there were Germans.</sentence><sentence id="241">And we knew they were there because right out from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span>, a big <span class="BUILDING">military base barracks</span> where military were stationed.</sentence><sentence id="242">They lived there.</sentence><sentence id="243">They had <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="244">Right out side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span>, about couple of kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="245">A very, very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the soldiers used to come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="246">All of a sudden before that there were Poles that were there.</sentence><sentence id="247">The Russians came in and the Russians took over that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and made it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian military camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">And all of a sudden, the Russians weren't there and the Germans were there.</sentence><sentence id="249">So the Russians interlude was sort of a beginning and an end and sort of no middle to me.</sentence><sentence id="250">Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="300">Q: Tell me about the Germans and what happened.</sentence><sentence id="301">How did life change.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="304">A <span class="DLF">Well</span>, the Germans came and the Jews were...two basic orders.</sentence><sentence id="305">One was a location order and since the Jews tended to live in a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> anyhow there wasn't really that much relocation.</sentence><sentence id="306">Some people had to move and it got a little bit more crowded, but it didn't crowd us all that much.</sentence><sentence id="307">They just adjusted the boundaries of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> because the Jews and the Poles did not intermingle all that much even though it was a combined Jewish-Polish town.</sentence><sentence id="308">The Jews lived in one <span class="REGION">area</span>, and the Poles lived in another <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">And so the few Jews who lived outside of this <span class="REGION">area</span> were forced to come in and find <span class="NPIP">places</span> with friends, relatives, whoever it may be, and it got a little bit more crowded.</sentence><sentence id="310">The other thing, of course, was that there were curfews and you could not leave this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="311">There were <span class="DLF">boundaries</span> but no real <span class="DLF">fences</span>, no <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>, no real guards to speak of.</sentence><sentence id="312">You had to be there, and the</sentence><sentence id="314">penalty was harsh.</sentence><sentence id="315">If you were found <span class="NPIP">outside</span> it, you were shot.</sentence><sentence id="316">And they did do a lot of shooting of people.</sentence><sentence id="317">Terror killings.</sentence><sentence id="318">They came in and just took little groups here and there.</sentence><sentence id="319">And no rhyme or reason.</sentence><sentence id="320">Presumably they were leaders or whatever, but many people that were killed, they were not leaders.</sentence><sentence id="321">I don't understand what the rationale was.</sentence><sentence id="322">Maybe just to generate enough fear that people would obey orders and not argue about it.</sentence><sentence id="323">And people had to wear the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="324">You had to wear two stars, one front and one back.</sentence><sentence id="325">And if you were caught without a star, the penalty was death.</sentence><sentence id="326">So you had to wear the star to be identified fully as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="327">And you were not permitted to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">Life became more difficult in terms of food and making a living because all the relationships and business things, and whatever the case may be...those could not exist anymore.</sentence><sentence id="329">So people lived off of accumulations and savings or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="330">But that was of no consequence because we're dealing with only 3 months and I am sure the people had enough capital or whatever to live for 3 months.</sentence><sentence id="331">So there was no real transition to Jew(ish) ghetto situation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="362">Q: How did you feel the change as a kid?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="364">A: The change was a different life style.</sentence><sentence id="365">It's a tension, and it was very clear...the kids understood it very well.</sentence><sentence id="366">There were no arguments about the curfews and not being able to go to certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> that you used to go and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="367">It was very clear that this was serious.</sentence><sentence id="368">This was real.</sentence><sentence id="369">This wasn't just parental whim...no, you can't go here because whatever the case may be.</sentence><sentence id="370">This was very clear that the kids almost...it's almost like a law of nature.</sentence><sentence id="371">At that age you understand that you don't jump off the <span class="DLF">roof</span> because it is dangerous and it isn't just that your parent is afraid.</sentence><sentence id="372">You really don't jump off the <span class="DLF">roof</span> because you may get hurt and you're old enough and smart enough to know that you don't want that to happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="373">It was almost that kind of a thing.</sentence><sentence id="374">It was not an issue of somebody telling you.</sentence><sentence id="375">You knew you did not do these things.</sentence><sentence id="376">It was almost as if it was a physical law.</sentence><sentence id="377">You didn't cross this <span class="DLF">barrier</span> because something horrible would happen.sothere was no issue about dis...disobeying anybody or...or trying some childish tricks about these rules.</sentence><sentence id="378">You stayed where you were supposed to stay.</sentence><sentence id="379">You wore the yellow star like you were supposed to wear the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="380">It was a very strange experience in terms of growing up.</sentence><sentence id="381">There was a jump of years.</sentence><sentence id="382">I would think that normally a child would not acquire that kind of mental outlook till later.</sentence><sentence id="383">And in my case I was 6, and it happened very fast and I don't know exactly how the adjustment was made, but I do recall that all of a sudden I had this outlook that this is normal.</sentence><sentence id="384">This is how you were supposed to do and it wasn't a matter of somebody telling me.</sentence><sentence id="385">I believed it.</sentence><sentence id="386">So there was some kind of mental adjustment.</sentence><sentence id="387">I had no idea how it was done.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="413">Q: You were an observant family I understand it...Jewishly observant family.</sentence><sentence id="414">Did that...did the curfew affect that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="420">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="421">Our family, my grandfather was extremely Orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="422">Mine was not that much in those <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="423">Here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> it would be considered.</sentence><sentence id="424">I mean it depends.</sentence><sentence id="425">Everything is relative.</sentence><sentence id="426">But it wasn't any big deal.</sentence><sentence id="427">All the Jews were observant in one <span class="NPIP">form</span> or another.</sentence><sentence id="428">Those who were not observant were what you call it extremely traditional.</sentence><sentence id="429">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>(???)</sentence><sentence id="430">and the other <span class="REGION">areas</span> we were hardly Yiddishist related.</sentence><sentence id="431">We had many people there in our own family too that were involved with Yiddishkeit not Jewish historical, but the Yiddish language and the Yiddish literature.</sentence><sentence id="432"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, as you know, was the place of the YIVO, the Jewish what do you call it? "</sentence><sentence id="433">Wissenschaft" <span class="BUILDING">Jewish knowledge institute</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Knowledge Institute</span> or whatever the proper translation would be.</sentence><sentence id="434">And it was a modern type movement dealing with current events as opposed to historical Judaism, and dealing with the Yiddish language as a force and the Yiddish literature as a force.</sentence><sentence id="435">And many of these people were totally unobservant in the sense of holding to the Mitzvoth because they believed (not) in the Torah.</sentence><sentence id="436">But that was a way of life and it would be very fine for these people not to follow through.</sentence><sentence id="437">So they were traditional in the sense of this is how a Jew lived whereas those who were observant were this is how a Jew lived and this is how a Jew must live.</sentence><sentence id="438">It's a very fine distinction in that case.</sentence><sentence id="439">Today, of course, the distinctions are much greater.</sentence><sentence id="440">So I don't think there was any impact in terms of the behavior of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because that's how Jews lived.</sentence><sentence id="441">And all of the stuff was internal anyway.</sentence><sentence id="442">It isn't as if you went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to a Polish friend and had a ham sandwich.</sentence><sentence id="443">So if you are talking about kosher food it was all Jewishly created in any event and the fact that the Germans were around us that didn't change anything.</sentence><sentence id="444">At least I don't recall it.</sentence><sentence id="445">I mean this is a very poor perspective from a 6 year old, but that's how I recall it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="472">Q: How did things change?</sentence><sentence id="473">When did things change?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="476">A: Well, things changed a couple of months after the Germans came really....significantly in that <span class="NPIP">places</span> started disappearing.</sentence><sentence id="477">I don't know how else to say it.</sentence><sentence id="478">All of a sudden a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="479">There were no Jews there.</sentence><sentence id="480">It as if it was pulled off the map and shipped off to Mars or something.</sentence><sentence id="481">Somebody would come in, "I escaped.</sentence><sentence id="482">All the rest are gone."

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: What happened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="584">A: What happened is that in September of 1941 on the Friday before Sabbath Shuva which was on the 20th of September German groups...soldiers came and organized various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local men villages</span>, primarily civilian.</sentence><sentence id="585">There may have been some Poles in those groups but I am not aware of any, and it is my understanding it was one of the Einsatzgruppen came to finish off <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span>.</sentence><sentence id="586">There were about 2,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> and surrounding vicinity there were little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farm communities</span> or whatever and just lived all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="587">It happened that one of the local police functionaries was friendly with a certain Jews because of some prior favors that they had done to each other.</sentence><sentence id="588">And he knew that these people came in and they were organizing various things.</sentence><sentence id="589">He didn't know precisely why but it was quite obvious.</sentence><sentence id="590">And so he came to his Jewish friend and he said, "Something is going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="591">You have hours before the <span class="NPIP">place</span> will be surrounded and nobody will be able to get out."</sentence><sentence id="592">This man sent out the alarm.</sentence><sentence id="593">Most people (a) didn't believe it and (b) had no idea what to do anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="594">They weren't going to leave children.</sentence><sentence id="595">They weren't going to leave parents, and they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and they said, "If 1 am going to die, I might as well die right here."</sentence><sentence id="596">Many people such as my father believed it more or less but they wouldn't go because in prior times there had been false alarms and there was a great deal of looting and people were afraid of losing their few possessions because really you were not going to have a chance to work or do anything useful to gain more possessions.</sentence><sentence id="597">But there was some work I should say.</sentence><sentence id="598">The Germans put the Jews to work in slave labor and it was very hard work.</sentence><sentence id="599">In fact, my father worked at slave labor and he fell down.</sentence><sentence id="600">It</sentence><sentence id="602">wasn't deliberate.</sentence><sentence id="603">He fell off a...a <span class="BUILDING">scaffolding</span> or something and he broke two of his ribs.</sentence><sentence id="604">So at that time he had taped up ribs and...and that was the situation.</sentence><sentence id="605">But anyhow my father decided to send my mother, brother and myself out.</sentence><sentence id="606">We...we agreed where they would go and he said he knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> very well.</sentence><sentence id="607">He was a strong man.</sentence><sentence id="608">He was a very, very strong physically, my father in spite of his broken rib, and he felt confident that he could get out no matter what they did because he knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> extremely well and he would be able to hide and sneak through.</sentence><sentence id="609">He said, "I am going to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and if there's looting I'll stop them.</sentence><sentence id="610">If something is happening I'll come meet you there next day."</sentence><sentence id="611">So we packed up some food.</sentence><sentence id="612">It was the Sabbath food, some chicken I remember and a few other things in a bundle, dressed up as peasant woman and took off the yellow stars and we walked right out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="613">Nobody stopped us.</sentence><sentence id="614">There were no guards.</sentence><sentence id="615">There was no nothing.</sentence><sentence id="616">The problem was we had to walk right by the <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="617">And that scared us because we were sure that these people would do something.</sentence><sentence id="618">But they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="619">They had nothing to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="620">Those were ordinary soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="621">The Einsatzgruppen group were the SS, and the soldiers were soldiers, and we were just peasants walking by.</sentence><sentence id="622">We walked right by the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> a couple of miles out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there's a little <span class="DLF">road</span> to the side where all these Germans...the soldiers were staying, and we saw them coming and going and we just kept walking.</sentence><sentence id="623">And it was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="624">And so we kept walking.</sentence><sentence id="625">And we had a couple of hours walk to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a certain <span class="DLF">farm</span> of a woman that our family knew, had done some business with her.</sentence><sentence id="626">Fine lady presumably.</sentence><sentence id="627">She was a widow, had a teenage son.</sentence><sentence id="628">I would guess 15, 16 years old.</sentence><sentence id="629">And we came there and she was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and mother told her something is happening and we need to hide.</sentence><sentence id="630">The woman was very fearful.</sentence><sentence id="631">She didn't want us there, but she couldn't turn us away.</sentence><sentence id="632">So she said, "Okay.</sentence><sentence id="633">I won't let you in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="634">I am afraid.</sentence><sentence id="635">Go stay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>."</sentence><sentence id="636">There was a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and there was hay in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and we crawled up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> and the hay, and the <span class="DLF">barn walls</span> were not wood.</sentence><sentence id="637">They were kind of straw and we could see through the chinks in the matted straw.</sentence><sentence id="638">And during the night we started hearing shooting.</sentence><sentence id="639">So it was bad.</sentence><sentence id="640">It was clear that something was really going on.</sentence><sentence id="641">It was a lot of shooting.</sentence><sentence id="642">And father was supposed to come during the night if something would happen.</sentence><sentence id="643">He didn't come.</sentence><sentence id="644">And so we were sure that he couldn't get out.</sentence><sentence id="645">That was the end of him.</sentence><sentence id="646">In the morning we didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="647">But before we could do something, a Lithuanian local auxiliary came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he wanted to know if any Jews were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and the woman, "I haven't...I don't know anything about Jews.</sentence><sentence id="648">No Jews in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="649">If you want, come in and look."</sentence><sentence id="650">And he says, "There are other <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="651">What about your <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>?</sentence><sentence id="652">Jews have sneaked into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>."</sentence><sentence id="653">She said, "Silly, what would Jews be doing ina <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>?" "</sentence><sentence id="654">Listen, you have been working very hard," she says, "it's been a horrible day.</sentence><sentence id="655">They're working all night chasing these terrible Jews.</sentence><sentence id="656">Come in and have something to eat and you can chase some more Jews."</sentence><sentence id="657">He says, "Okay," so they went into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="658">And she gave him breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="659">I don't know what.</sentence><sentence id="660">He was eating breakfast and her teenage son came into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we heard this and this was very close so we could hear them talking.</sentence><sentence id="661">We saw him with a gun, a bolt action rifle.</sentence><sentence id="662">I remember it.</sentence><sentence id="663">You had to pull the bolt, an old type rifle.</sentence><sentence id="664">And the son came in and he said, "I'm going to get you across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="665">Come quickly."</sentence><sentence id="666">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Popberezha</span> is on two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> as I said.</sentence><sentence id="667">One is a major <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span></sentence><sentence id="669">called the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Lyna</span> [this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> is far west from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span>!]</sentence><sentence id="670">which you will find in all the big maps I think.</sentence><sentence id="671">It was the Lyna that was going over there or it could have been the other one.</sentence><sentence id="672">I can't swear to it.</sentence><sentence id="673">Anyhow he came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="674">We got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and he was rowing us across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and we were about two-thirds across and for whatever reason this person saw us through the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">He got up, he stretched or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="676">He saw us through the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="677">He dropped his where the .......2?</sentence><sentence id="678">is gone.</sentence><sentence id="679">He ran out and he pointed his gun at this young man and he started shouting for him to come back or he would kill him but this fellow continued to row for about another half a minute.</sentence><sentence id="680">We were close.</sentence><sentence id="681">If we were not close, I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="682">He continued to row.</sentence><sentence id="683">We got to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">We jumped out and then this fellow, I think, he shot one shot or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="685">This guy turned around and he came back.</sentence><sentence id="686">He came back.</sentence><sentence id="687">He got him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and rowed him across so the Lithuanian rode across and he was about 5, 7 minutes behind us.</sentence><sentence id="688">He got out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we were near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="689">There were some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="690">And he starting shooting at us.</sentence><sentence id="691">And we just kept going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and he was right behind us.</sentence><sentence id="692">And I don't know how he missed us, but he missed us.</sentence><sentence id="693">Now we couldn't go very fast because we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and there were branches ripping us up, you know, and I was not running too fast.</sentence><sentence id="694">I'm a little kid.</sentence><sentence id="695">And we were not woodsmen people.</sentence><sentence id="696">We're towns people.</sentence><sentence id="697">So we kept running in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and he was behind us shooting at us all the time.</sentence><sentence id="698">And this woman was sure that we were dead.</sentence><sentence id="699">I mean it's impossible that we would escape.</sentence><sentence id="700">And she never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="701">He just went wherever he went.</sentence><sentence id="702">And she never saw us.</sentence><sentence id="703">She didn't go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to look obviously.</sentence><sentence id="704">Anyhow, he didn't kill us.</sentence><sentence id="705">So we were in these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we're running in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and finally, we knew we lost him.</sentence><sentence id="706">But we're lost in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="707">We don't know where to go or anything.</sentence><sentence id="708">Just lost in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">And we're wondering around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in circles or whatever...just going in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">Finally, we're up on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> or something and in the distance we saw the spire of a <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="711">Very tall.</sentence><sentence id="712">So we needed a direction to go.</sentence><sentence id="713">Now a very strange thing.</sentence><sentence id="714">Many of the priests in that <span class="REGION">area</span> were illiterate priests.</sentence><sentence id="715">They were peasants themselves, and they were very anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="716">I have to say this.</sentence><sentence id="717">They were illiterate and they believed the Jews killed God.</sentence><sentence id="718">The Jews crucified Jesus and they preached it.</sentence><sentence id="719">And not as badly in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> but they preached it and there were plenty of anti-Semites.</sentence><sentence id="720">The towns people themselves were not bad.</sentence><sentence id="721">Strange deal.</sentence><sentence id="722">This <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that we saw, this priest was not only not anti- Semitic, he was, you might call, philo-semitic.</sentence><sentence id="723">He really believed that the Jews were a good people and that it was his christian duty to protect the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="724">He was very friendly with the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="725">And we got to this <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and a woman came out...the housekeeper or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="726">She says, "I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="727">The priest is not here.</sentence><sentence id="728">They're killing the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he went to see if he could help.</sentence><sentence id="729">But he left word if any Jew managed to come to this <span class="REGION">area</span> I am to do certain things for you.</sentence><sentence id="730">Here is some food."</sentence><sentence id="731">And what she gave us is milk, something to drink. "</sentence><sentence id="732">And I will lead you to where you can escape."</sentence><sentence id="733">And she sent us off to a <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="734">She told us where to go.</sentence><sentence id="735">And we had not known about this thing at all.</sentence><sentence id="736">It was an old <span class="DLF">smuggling network</span>.</sentence><sentence id="737">The <span class="REGION">area</span> is on the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and it changed hands many times and the people in this <span class="REGION">area</span>, they didn't feel the <span class="DLF">border</span> was real.</sentence><sentence id="738">I mean sometimes it's <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, sometimes <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="739">Who cares about customs.</sentence><sentence id="742">0 There was a whole bunch of people, a gang or whatever you call it who were smugglers.</sentence><sentence id="743">And the commodities they used to smuggle was saccharin (it) was a very big commodity because it's small, and it was very precious.</sentence><sentence id="744">Substitute for sugar because sugar was very hard to get.</sentence><sentence id="745">And cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="746">That was their big thing.</sentence><sentence id="747">Saccharin and cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="748">Anyhow, so she got in touch with this gang of smugglers.</sentence><sentence id="749">Now they were not altruistic and they were not anti-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="750">They enjoyed crossing <span class="DLF">borders</span> and taking risks if they got paid.</sentence><sentence id="751">So whatever money Mother had she paid up, and we went from hand to hand to hand to hand...a 2 week walk at night and they would hand us off to the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of this smuggling network.</sentence><sentence id="752">And on the <span class="DLF">road</span> on the way lots of other Jews got involved in this.</sentence><sentence id="753">Pretty soon there was anything...20, 30 people, sometimes coming and going, each one looking to get to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="754">And we were looking to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colsol</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span> where mother had a sister and she figured that's where she could go where she knew somebody.</sentence><sentence id="755">So he told them where she wanted to go and they said, "Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="756">We'll move you on this way.</sentence><sentence id="757">And this people were going to move you that way."</sentence><sentence id="758">Was a whole network of these people.</sentence><sentence id="759">And along the way, each one you gave a little bit of money.</sentence><sentence id="760">As long as your money held out you were alright.</sentence><sentence id="761">They gave you food.</sentence><sentence id="762">During the day we were hiding and at night we were walking through <span class="DLF">fields</span>, across <span class="DLF">barbed wire fences</span> and all kinds of stuff and it was pitch dark and they knew all the <span class="DLF">holes</span> and all the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and they would say, "Stop here.</sentence><sentence id="763">There's going to be a big <span class="DLF">ditch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">Hold hands cause you'll fall down."</sentence><sentence id="765">And we would hold on and walk across.</sentence><sentence id="766">And we walked for 2 weeks.</sentence><sentence id="767">And pretty soon we were on the outskirts of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they said, "That's it.</sentence><sentence id="768">Our job stops here.</sentence><sentence id="769">You're on your own.</sentence><sentence id="770">Do whatever you like."</sentence><sentence id="771">And all of a sudden they weren't there.</sentence><sentence id="772">And so we were down to nothing.</sentence><sentence id="773">My mother had two wedding rings.</sentence><sentence id="774">She had her own wedding ring and her father's wedding ring with her.</sentence><sentence id="775">Everything else was given away to these people, and we had to get to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="776">And it was far away and also dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="777">And there was a farmer with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> driving by so she came to him and she asked him if he would drive us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if he knew where it was.</sentence><sentence id="778">He said, "Sure." "</sentence><sentence id="779">Would you drive us?"</sentence><sentence id="780">He said, "Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="781">Pay me."</sentence><sentence id="782">So she decided she would pay him with her own wedding ring and hold father's because this was a memento.</sentence><sentence id="783">She was sure father was dead.</sentence><sentence id="784">So she gave him her wedding ring and he drove us right to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="785">Was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="786">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we came right in and I have to say this because there's feeling I have.</sentence><sentence id="787">I am unhappy with certain historians and other analysts who claim that the leaders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and the Jewish police were all nasty and hoodlums.</sentence><sentence id="788">Clearly, there were some nasty people there as anybody who rises to power and in the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> there were some tyrants.</sentence><sentence id="789">But all my experiences this one and others as I'll tell you, these people did an exemplary, selfless job in extremely different circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="790">We came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="791">They didn't know us.</sentence><sentence id="792">They didn't owe us.</sentence><sentence id="793">They took us in.</sentence><sentence id="794">They created papers for us as if we were members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so we could live there.</sentence><sentence id="795">They shared their food.</sentence><sentence id="796">They shared what they had.</sentence><sentence id="797">We became members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="798">We were fellow Jews.</sentence><sentence id="799">They took us in.</sentence><sentence id="800">There're other incidences when we escaped from this</sentence><sentence id="802">1 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where we had to go some <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">The same deal.</sentence><sentence id="804">In my experience, this is a baseless (ALL SOUND STOPS AT THIS POINT.</sentence><sentence id="805">I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ON THIS TAPE BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF TAPE LEFT AND THIS ENDING DOES NOT MATCH THE START OF THE NEXT TAPE).</sentence><sentence id="806">INSERT there are nine typewritten pages of insert at this point that must be somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="807">I have accuracy checked the transcript.</sentence><sentence id="808"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mschwarz</span></sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1089">A: It was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we kinda lived there.</sentence><sentence id="1090">That was not a big thing.</sentence><sentence id="1091">There was another <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> later which was a major thing to me.</sentence><sentence id="1092">This <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was transitory and I really don't have any great recollection because we moved around.</sentence><sentence id="1093">Sometimes we're here,</sentence><sentence id="1095">2 sometimes we're there.</sentence><sentence id="1096">Sometimes we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1097">There was a little, kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> except that it was very hot.</sentence><sentence id="1098">It was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brick oven</span> that also was used to heating the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very hot, but when we were presumably betrayed by someone we had to escape from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">And we went into the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1100">A lot of it was potato country, and when they harvested potatoes they stored them in <span class="DLF">holes</span> under ground in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1101">They would dig a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> and that's where the potatoes were kept because of cold air and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1102">Well, we hid in a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> underneath the potatoes in the big <span class="DLF">hole</span>, which was a very unpleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> because there were all kinds of worms and things and animals in there.</sentence><sentence id="1103">It was just a big <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground and potato bugs and whatever, and it just drove my mother crazy.</sentence><sentence id="1104">She couldn't stand those things.</sentence><sentence id="1105">She was almost willing to go and be caught.</sentence><sentence id="1106">My father just about forcible put her in there because, you know, she's not afraid of the Nazis, but she's afraid of the potato bugs.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Obviously she went down eventually, but it was not a pleasant <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be.</sentence><sentence id="1108">It's damp and eventually I got sick.</sentence><sentence id="1109">I became very sick and some kind of bronchitis and they thought I would die.</sentence><sentence id="1110">My father went out in the middle of the night and he went to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> someplace...don't know where...and he stole.</sentence><sentence id="1111">I mean that's the only words for it.</sentence><sentence id="1112">In a sense he stole.</sentence><sentence id="1113">He milked a cow, and he brought back warm milk.</sentence><sentence id="1114">The only warm thing we could have because there was no fire or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1115">It was cold.</sentence><sentence id="1116">And that's what I drank.</sentence><sentence id="1117">And I don't know if the milk helped, but I became better.</sentence><sentence id="1118">So he stole some milk.</sentence><sentence id="1119">Not a terrible crime.</sentence><sentence id="1120">Anyhow, after that we could not stay there anymore, and then we moved to another family.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Whereas the first family had some relationship and they had some reasons and they had reason to believe that we would really reward because my father promised and the grandfather and all that stuff, which was all true.</sentence><sentence id="1122">This other family, we kinda knew them, but there was no special relationship.</sentence><sentence id="1123">And this other family was very poor.</sentence><sentence id="1124">They had a lot of kids and they were very poor.</sentence><sentence id="1125">They didn't have enough to feed themselves and they took us in.</sentence><sentence id="1126">No ulterior motives.</sentence><sentence id="1127">They didn't ask for anything.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And these are the people that we really gave everything we could, even more than the other ones.</sentence><sentence id="1129">There were two families.</sentence><sentence id="1130">Okay?</sentence><sentence id="1131">Andamazing people.</sentence><sentence id="1132"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sienkowitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bagdanowski</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1133">I should say the names.</sentence><sentence id="1134">These are important people.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Two <span class="BUILDING">families</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sienkowitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bagdanowsky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1137">And we hid in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1138">We were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> ina hidden <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> and that was what I remember the most of the hiding and it was, for a young kid I didn't realize it then.</sentence><sentence id="1139">As an adult I really don't understand how I survived it and be half-way normal because it was tremendous sense of deprivation.</sentence><sentence id="1140">It was dark.</sentence><sentence id="1141">Everything was closed.</sentence><sentence id="1142">There was some light from the chinks in the slates in the <span class="DLF">roofs</span> but it was dark during the day and during the night.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And there were always people, strangers whoever, so you could not speak out loud.</sentence><sentence id="1144">So for over a year I was in the dark and I didn't speak.</sentence><sentence id="1145">And that's a crazy environment.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1147">I can't say I'm completely normal, but I don't think I'm very peculiar.</sentence><sentence id="1148">And so maybe that's a good sign that people can overcome all kinds of stuff.</sentence><sentence id="1149">And we stayed there for just about a year.</sentence><sentence id="1150">Now I need to back track one thing what</sentence><sentence id="1152">3 kept us going and what kept these people going which is what happened about 2 months or so after we reunited with Father.</sentence><sentence id="1153">You will recall from history that when (General von) Paulus was surrounded and captured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> in January of 1943, I believe it was.</sentence><sentence id="1154">I would have to look it up.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And the Russians made a big propaganda deal out of it.</sentence><sentence id="1156">They dropped leaflets all over...not <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> maybe, but all over the prior <span class="REGION">Russian territories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1157">Not only telling about it, but with complete pictures so it could not argued that it's a fake.</sentence><sentence id="1158">Or from Paulus and his bedraggled remnants of army or whatever thousand they captured...I don't know...300,000 that were there showing that they really were captured.</sentence><sentence id="1159">This was a tremendous celebration for us.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Father was convinced everybody that we talked to...all the...all the Gentiles were convinced that there's no question who would win the war.</sentence><sentence id="1161">It was no longer a issue of which <span class="NPIP">side</span> am I going to be on because I don't want to be in trouble with the victors.</sentence><sentence id="1162">The victors were going to be the Allies.</sentence><sentence id="1163">The Germans were going to lose the war.</sentence><sentence id="1164">There was just no doubt.</sentence><sentence id="1165">No matter what the Germans said, no matter what they did.</sentence><sentence id="1166">Once when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paulus</span> was destroyed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span>, as far as we're concerned, it is a matter of how long will it take.</sentence><sentence id="1167">Made life a lot easier.</sentence><sentence id="1168">All the uncertainty was gone.</sentence><sentence id="1169">All we had to do is stay alive.</sentence><sentence id="1170">And these people were certain if we were alive, eventually we would be liberated and if we could do something for them because they were poor people...these last ones and the previously ones were not so poor, but even so we would keep our word.</sentence><sentence id="1171">So it changed everything.</sentence><sentence id="1172">That victory in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> had special meaning for me because it really was the turning point as most historians say of the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, but also the turning point of belief in what was coming among those people who had to survive...the remaining Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1261">Q: Tell me a little more about life in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and how the farmer helped you particularly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1263">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1264">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1265">I don't know how the deal came about, but my parents...my father used to go out and work sometime on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1266">If somebody saw him, they could get away with it.</sentence><sentence id="1267">His hair had turned completely grey.</sentence><sentence id="1268">1 mean completely grey, prematurely grey.</sentence><sentence id="1269">And so rather than use his regular name which himself was not necessarily a Jewish name his name was Wolf and in Polish it's Ulfa so it could be maybe not a Jew, but it's sort of Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1270">So they started calling him Stary.</sentence><sentence id="1271">Stary in Polish means the old one because of his grey hair.</sentence><sentence id="1272">And so he acquired the nickname Stary and on that basis nobody would know who he is. "</sentence><sentence id="1273">Who's that?" "</sentence><sentence id="1274">Oh, that's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1275">He came to help us."</sentence><sentence id="1276">Or something.</sentence><sentence id="1277">And so he could go out during the day.</sentence><sentence id="1278">My mother could go out sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="1279">Her Polish was quite decent.</sentence><sentence id="1280">My brother's Polish was not wonderful, but not too bad because he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> prior.</sentence><sentence id="1281">I didn't know any Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1282">I could only speak Yiddish, and I never went to <span class="BUILDING">local school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1283">My Polish was just words that I picked up, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1284">You live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you pick up Polish, but it's not as if you live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, where you live here you speak English from birth no matter what your ethnic heritage.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Over there if you were Jewish you spoke Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="1286">Who spoke Polish unless you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or when you got older.</sentence><sentence id="1287">So my Polish was just awful.</sentence><sentence id="1288">I don't know any Polish to this day.</sentence><sentence id="1289">I know Russian because this...this one and a half years was really Russian...<span class="BUILDING">Russian school</span> so</sentence><sentence id="1291">4 I... have some decent knowledge of Russian.</sentence><sentence id="1292">My Polish is just useless.</sentence><sentence id="1293">My brother's Polish was not that terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1294">He could go out.</sentence><sentence id="1295">I could not go out.</sentence><sentence id="1296">It was dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1297">If somebody saw me and said something to me, as soon as I opened my mouth there was no question I was not a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="1298">I was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1299">And I couldn't pretend to be Lithuanian either because the accent was just wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1300">So they made a deal or agreed or whatever, one night the farmer came and he said, "We're going for a walk."</sentence><sentence id="1301">So wonderful. "</sentence><sentence id="1302">Come on, We're going for a walk."</sentence><sentence id="1303">And so we went for a walk.</sentence><sentence id="1304">And it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1305">Just him and me.</sentence><sentence id="1306">Nobody else.</sentence><sentence id="1307">Still who knows who would see us?</sentence><sentence id="1308">It was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1309">There were rewards for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1310">The reward was salt.</sentence><sentence id="1311">I hadn't seen that written any <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1312">The reward was salt.</sentence><sentence id="1313">I don't remember how many kilograms of salt.</sentence><sentence id="1314">Salt was a great commodity.</sentence><sentence id="1315">Very hard to get.</sentence><sentence id="1316">Very precious.</sentence><sentence id="1317">People wanted salt more than sugar.</sentence><sentence id="1318">And if you handed in some Jews you got salt.</sentence><sentence id="1319">People looked for the reward and there were nasty people who would do it for the reward.</sentence><sentence id="1320">They would do it out of spite.</sentence><sentence id="1321">While we were hiding there, there was a family hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and one day, some so-called great patriotic partisans who were fighting for the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>...Poles in this case...found them.</sentence><sentence id="1322">They took them out.</sentence><sentence id="1323">They shot them...saw it through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1324">And they came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1325">They asked for some to drink, and they told the farmer, "Go bury those people."</sentence><sentence id="1326">And they were sitting there talking in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> talking next door to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where we were and then they left.</sentence><sentence id="1327">And they were Poles, Army Krajowa from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1328">There were other partisans, mostly Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1329">One day my father was caught by them and he was sure they were going to kill him.</sentence><sentence id="1330">And then they looked him over and they decided he was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1331">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on them.</sentence><sentence id="1332">He stumbled on their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1333">And then they looked him over and they decided that he's a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1334">They didn't know who he was because he stumbled on their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1335">And they said to him, "Don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="1336">We're not going to hurt you.</sentence><sentence id="1337">We're just like you."</sentence><sentence id="1338">In Russian "Vi tozje takoje" which means we are also like that.</sentence><sentence id="1339">Those are the exact words they said because Father repeated it, so I'm repeating you what he said.</sentence><sentence id="1340">And in fact they said, "Do you have any food?"</sentence><sentence id="1341">He says "No." "</sentence><sentence id="1342">Come here."</sentence><sentence id="1343">They had shot an animal.</sentence><sentence id="1344">Don't know where.</sentence><sentence id="1345">Maybe...probably a farmer's animal, and they gave him a quarter of beef to take with him.</sentence><sentence id="1346">They sent him on his way.</sentence><sentence id="1347">Didn't hurt him.</sentence><sentence id="1348">They were prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1349">The Russian prisoners of war were treated abominantly by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1350">There was a prisoner of war camp not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.516666" long="26.183333">Soly</span> and obviously the Jews were all eventually, they say eliminated and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.516666" long="26.183333">Soly</span> was sent off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponari</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> and the prisoner of war camps were not eliminated, but none of them survived.</sentence><sentence id="1351">The living conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were a hundred times better than the prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1352">The Jews used to give them food if they could.</sentence><sentence id="1353">They were starved to death and worked to death, those Russian prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1354">And when they escaped their hatred for the Germans was something unimaginable.</sentence><sentence id="1355">They would very glad die as long as they could take some with them.</sentence><sentence id="1356">And many of them became very sympathetic to the Jews, especially if they came from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like the one I described where the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> tried to help.</sentence><sentence id="1357">So even though the Russians were not that well known for their love of Jews, the Russian escaped prisoners of war were not that bad as far as the Jews were concerned.</sentence><sentence id="1360">5 And this particular band helped my father.</sentence><sentence id="1361">We learned later that this band was wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="1362">They got into a fire fight with somebody, and they were all killed apparently.</sentence><sentence id="1363">Don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1364">But anyhow, so we lived in this little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and about once a week or so, from then on, we was determined we go for a walk for a hour or so at night always, look at the stars, talk a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1365">Was not a very imaginative conversation because my Polish was not that great.</sentence><sentence id="1366">They were wonderful people because one day there was a big scare that somebody had seen us there too.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And we didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1368">So we decided...they decided...this was a tremendous chance.</sentence><sentence id="1369">I can't understand how these people decided to do this.</sentence><sentence id="1370">It was totally insane.</sentence><sentence id="1371">We would just integrate with the family because if they found us in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> clearly we were strangers.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And I remember he put me in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with his daughter.</sentence><sentence id="1373">And it was at night because somebody was supposed to come searching and we crawled into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> together as if we were, you know, living together because I was young enough.</sentence><sentence id="1374">She was a little kid, but I think younger than me, so it was considered alright under those conditions because the family was very crowded.</sentence><sentence id="1375">And the only thing I remember is the giant bed bugs.</sentence><sentence id="1376">They were about this big. (</sentence><sentence id="1377">Laughter) Huge red things, which we did not have in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1378">In that respect the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was better.</sentence><sentence id="1379">We had rats or mice and they were not good things to have.</sentence><sentence id="1380">They were scary at night.</sentence><sentence id="1381">But these bed bugs bit and they were big.</sentence><sentence id="1382">They made hugh holes in your flesh, and, of course, there were lice and other things.</sentence><sentence id="1383">We suffered from dysentery and lice and all kinds of intestinal parasites.</sentence><sentence id="1384">And there was no...very, very bad sanitary conditions and the local people suffered from the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1385">It wasn't just us.</sentence><sentence id="1386">It was local conditions were that way.</sentence><sentence id="1387">So that made a big difference, the...the walks at night.</sentence><sentence id="1388">And then eventually the Russian Army came in and we moved right with them.</sentence><sentence id="1389">We didn't stay.</sentence><sentence id="1390">Nobody stayed.</sentence><sentence id="1391">Anybody who survived didn't stay.</sentence><sentence id="1392">We ended up as refugees just moving from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
