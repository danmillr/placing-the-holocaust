class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">Maybe she could make a normal life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Asven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">And, really, it came very soon.</sentence><sentence id="172">They took the young people who was not married to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Popravitz</span> in the high Tatras.</sentence><sentence id="173">From this <span class="NPIP">place</span> they make, they organize <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> .. and send them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Midonic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="174">It was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denbrin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">The <span class="NPIP">place</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Midonic</span>, according to what I, as I heard, they killed

nothing.</sentence><sentence id="178">They couldn't sleep even in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179"><span class="NPIP">Outside</span>, only.</sentence><sentence id="180">And you know how it is, it comes typhus, and then you lose every | night a hundred souls.</sentence><sentence id="181">| When I heard that it happened, I have a girlfriend, I W went to her parents and I told them I am moving to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and if you want I can take Edith and the same day I went to my mother, I told her I take Rose with me.</sentence><sentence id="182">So it happened this, my friend, | made me a meeting with the police and they told me between 10 and 11 o'clock you can pass the fronchar from here up to here, kilometer, this and this, because nobody will be there.</sentence><sentence id="183">So we passed the fronchar, we went to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="REGION">Hungarian territory</span> before it was <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">It was a family, we came in, they knew about such transportations because they used the people, the young people used this <span class="DLF">channel</span> very often.</sentence><sentence id="185">The girls stayed by this family.</sentence><sentence id="186">I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">I came to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="188">She was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sejose</span>, and told her that Rose is in Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="189">And the next night I moved again to Hungarian and take her to do something else.</sentence><sentence id="190">And you know what the first question from my mother was?</sentence><sentence id="191">It was Saturday, and, "How do you came here?"</sentence><sentence id="192">I told her, "By a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>."</sentence><sentence id="193">And she told me, "Today is Sabbath."</sentence><sentence id="194">It was very, very heavy for me, but it was, as I told you, the next night, with the help of my friends, I passed again the fronchar, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalani</span>, we had some Hungarian money, and the next day we went with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shatarajawihe</span>, and by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span>, it was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="REGION">East Slovakia</span>, about 60,000 inhabitants, and to stay there and to decide what to do further.</sentence><sentence id="196">It's, maybe it is a question of why I went so around and not straight with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">Because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the girls have been, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through <span class="REGION">Hungarian territory</span> that used to be before <span class="REGION">Czechoslovak territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">And custom officers went together.</sentence><sentence id="199">So it was a danger that we would be detained, "What are you doing here?"</sentence><sentence id="200">So we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">We stayed there about three or four days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koshitse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">The girls have been by the grandmother of my girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="203">And me and the old friend of mine, an older gentlemen, Mr. Greenstein, he helped me to get some money.</sentence><sentence id="204">So we went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and during one hour we had money for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">Because for the same reasons, we have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Usharot</span> where we had a very large family.</sentence><sentence id="206">My mother, cousins and adult children and we wanted that one of them should go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we used to live before we must go to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">Do you remember?</sentence><sentence id="208">To get some papers that we were living in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> from 1927 until 1938.</sentence><sentence id="209">It was true.</sentence><sentence id="210">But he couldn't arrange it, Mr.Greenstein.</sentence><sentence id="211">He died here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">We arranged the next route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">We were very good in Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="214">We could speak Hungarian like all other people.</sentence><sentence id="215">But sometimes it, the police made controls in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">We came from the front, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fronchar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">And we heard the people talk about the problems in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, what they are doing with Jewish 10 people, and that many are running to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungaria</span>, so we have been afraid.</sentence><sentence id="218">But we came through, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> I have a halfsister.</sentence><sentence id="219">We had the same father but not the same mother.</sentence><sentence id="220">The mother of my half-sister died.</sentence><sentence id="221">We came there and we asked her to help us.</sentence><sentence id="222">So my sister stayed on this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I went with my girlfriend, she had an uncle there.</sentence><sentence id="223">He was a very good situated man and she went to visit him.</sentence><sentence id="224">I went with her.</sentence><sentence id="225">I was sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and she was talking <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and she told my uncle don't want to help

been not covered already, but only wires with nails.</sentence><sentence id="632">So we tried to lock them.</sentence><sentence id="633">Maybe we could do it.</sentence><sentence id="634">But after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherletz</span> we passed a main <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="635">As we came out you feel it because when you are going through this <span class="DLF">crossingways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="636">So the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> made a stop.</sentence><sentence id="637">And somebody opened the <span
