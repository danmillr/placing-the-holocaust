<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: I'm an only child and uh an only grandchild for the first five years of my life.</sentence><sentence id="12">My cousin Stephen was born in 1936.</sentence><sentence id="13">I was very close to my maternal grandparents who lived very near us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">Spent many very happy childhood hours in their uh company.</sentence><sentence id="15">Had a wonderful relationship with my grandfather, who passed away in December 1935, and that was a great uh calamity to my young years.</sentence><sentence id="16">I became perhaps even closer to my grandmother at that time, and that grandmother played a very important role uh in my life.</sentence><sentence id="17">She still managed to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">She was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and when we arrived in 1946 we resumed that close relationship until her dying days uh in the early "60's.</sentence><sentence id="19">Uh on my father's side uh my grandfather lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="20">Unfortunately the grandmother, after whom I am named, Johanna, passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War.</sentence><sentence id="21">She died in February 1919 from the then-epidemic of the so-called Spanish Influenza and I obviously never knew her.</sentence><sentence id="22">I did know the second partner of my grandfather was a very lovely lady by the name of , well-known but the sister of the wellknown uh .</sentence><sentence id="23">Uh I did visit these grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> several times.</sentence><sentence id="24">I'm not quite sure how often and they came to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> but uh that grandfather also died very early, in March of 1936.</sentence><sentence id="25">So I don't have too much of a recollection except that I do remember him.</sentence><sentence id="26">a very stern man, very religious man, very learned man as a matter of fact in both the working and religious category.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: Well, <span class="DLF">mine</span> was really very good.</sentence><sentence id="46">Uh I have a very recollections of being a little bit spoiled, being that I'm the only grandchild or was the only grandchild until uh I was five years old.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="47">Uh I was taken to many <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">My parents took me to uh <span class="DLF">parks</span>, <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span>, etc.</sentence><sentence id="49">We lived ina very lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">I had wonderful toys, and with the uh birth of my cousin who of course almost became like a brother figure to me since I was an only child, uh life was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="51">I spent an awful lot of time, many hours with my aunt and unale, and as a matter of fact, the relationship uh with that aunt and uncle and my other aunt, and I will mention their names.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="55">Uh the parents of my cousin are Lotta (ph) and Eric , and unfortunately my uncle Eric just passed away uh about two and uh since both my parents died within ten weeks of each other in 1961, I can honestly say that my two aunts and my uncle very much took the place of my parents not only to me but also to my children.</sentence><sentence id="56">have the same emotional attachment to these two aunts and one uncle as I have.</sentence><sentence id="57">Uh I spent many happy hours with my aunt and uncle after my cousin was born, and uh when they decided that it was time to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which was in March of 1937, they uh so-called brother figure and now had disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="58">They had left, and we were left alone uh with my grandmother She was not married and she left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the Kristallnacht, in December of 1938.</sentence><sentence id="59">She lived with my grandmother and again with her too I had a very wonderful relationship and still do.</sentence><sentence id="60">Uh I would think that uh the loss of my aunt and uncle and my cousin was overcome in same measure that now <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started for me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="61">And I entered <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the school year of 1937, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> uh called at one time <span class="BUILDING">School</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">Rather famous for it's <span class="BUILDING">girls school</span> of uh high but by the time I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was no longer called .</sentence><sentence id="63">I believe it was closed in 1933 and the , but uh the buildilng was taken over by the Jewish community uh <span class="BUILDING">center</span>, community council or whatever it was called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> when Jewish children no longer could attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">And I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was one, at that point, perhaps on the scale of an American so-called <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew day school</span>, a half-day uh singular subject and half-days.</sentence><sentence id="66">Unfortunately I only went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about a year and a half before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but the year and a half I was there were very happy years.</sentence><sentence id="67">I remember my some of the girls that went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in particular the daughters of my parents" friend, friends, the Meyers, Dr.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="68">Meyer and his wife Edith and their three daughters, uh no, three children.</sentence><sentence id="69">Sorry.</sentence><sentence id="70">Two daughters and one son.</sentence><sentence id="71">One of the daughters, .</sentence><sentence id="72">The Meyers immigrated with us to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and the Millers went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and , but when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war in 1946, this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the clouds over my childhood did not begin until well, the death of my two grandfathers, which obviously had some effect.</sentence><sentence id="73">Uh in particular because they didn't want to tell me that my grandfather had passed away, which obviously UhI spent a lot of time consoling my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="74">Uh I do remember but nevertheless it seems that my presence uh being with her did help her.</sentence><sentence id="75">Uh as, and obviously then my father had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and again there was a the memorial candles that were burning in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I do remember that very vividly, and really both parents were in doing the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="76">And strangely enough both are my parents dying within ten weeks of each other and I was in for more than.</sentence><sentence id="77">Uh and as I say, I think that the first clouds that I can recollect obviously began when in October of 1938, one day the teacher came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> and said all those children whose parents had immigrated into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> uh please leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">Your parents would like you to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or whatever she said.</sentence><sentence id="79">She certainly didn't say that they were going to be deported that very same day but this was the beginning of the deportation of uh Polish Jews in particular.</sentence><sentence id="80">I, perhaps it was other Jews as well, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="81">But I think it was Polish Jews primarily were sent that very day, that same evening, out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and back to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">I think that the Poles didn't want them, and the Germans didn't want them.</sentence><sentence id="83">I do remember that there was a child of a SpanishPortugese family in my class, and he was the rabbi of the uh I think, I believe the one and only <span class="BUILDING">Spanish synagogue</span> in uh all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and she was in my <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span>, and I think that she also was called out.</sentence><sentence id="84">I'm not, I couldn't uh vouch for that.</sentence><sentence id="85">But children of Polish parents were</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="89">deported, together with their families that very uh evening, and that was October 1938.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="90">Obviously that left some impression on all of us children.</sentence><sentence id="91">I don't know to what extent thet meant anything to us, but I'm sure it also created a great deal of uncertainity and insecurity of our parents as that did in itself must have been felt by the children.</sentence><sentence id="92">Then the next big event obviously was the 10th of November, 1938 - the Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="93">And I have very vivid and very clear recollections of that event.</sentence><sentence id="94">Like every other morning I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and uh this is not the uh era of radio and television and we didn't know what happened during the night.</sentence><sentence id="95">I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like every other morning, and my way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> passed a big uh <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span>, the center of ,Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="96">And in fact the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> has done a great deal to uh bring the whole life of what they call the Jewish life under the which is that section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> where the orthodox Jews lived, where the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="97">Uh they bought all this back to life with many, in many different ways, particularly the permanent exhibits.</sentence><sentence id="98">I think the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> stood today has a memorial plaque which was only last year uh inaugurated and we brought the exhibit to in July which was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="99">But nevertheless, this is the place I had to cross on my way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and what I saw was hoards of people standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and throwing stones <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">And uh as we arrived, of course we ran past the uh the <span class="NPIP">place</span> itself, the noise, the shouting, the screaming.</sentence><sentence id="101">I suppose there was an aura of because we still didn't know what was happening but I suppose just the mere fact that so many people were there and throwing stones into the <span class="DLF">stained glass windows</span> was enough to make us and arrived at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and were immediately told that our parents would pick us up.</sentence><sentence id="102">We should remain calm and we wouldn't have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that day.</sentence><sentence id="103">And indeed a few minutes later, or a half hour later or whatever the case may be, my mother did arrive and took me to my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where my father already was.</sentence><sentence id="104">And here then unfolded slowly but surely the uh grim story of what happened during the night, that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> all through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had been set on fire, destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="105">were burned in most cases.</sentence><sentence id="106">It is known that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> sacrificed themselves to run into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to save some of the , hid them and I believe were successful in doing so.</sentence><sentence id="107">Uh that the had been demolished.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="108">merchandise had been thrown into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> covered with water and with ink and I mean it was chaos and total destruction.</sentence><sentence id="109">Uh my father decided that he had to see for himself what was happening and indeed did go into the downtown area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="110">He came back .</sentence><sentence id="111">In the meantime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or taken off to uh <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> and eventually ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> or in or many other places that at that time already existed as uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">I'm not sure whether <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> was already in existence but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and were.</sentence><sentence id="113">And my aunt at that time was engaged to be married to a man by the name.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="114">and he had arrived at work and was immediately taken by the police to .</sentence><sentence id="115">We stayed the entire day with my grandmother, so the events that were taking place and this was as I said the center Jewish life, so obviously knew where the Jews lived my grandmother had a uh <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that looked out on the main <span class="DLF">street</span>, the and from the <span class="DLF">window</span> we could watch much of what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="116">Uh since my grandfather had passed away in 1935 and it was known that there was no man living in her, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and she had a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which ran from one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> to the next, uh my father, another elderly gentlemen and a friend of their family decided to spend the day uh in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back rooms</span> of this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and indeed that day nothing really happened.</sentence><sentence id="117">No SS men or no uh secret police came to uh my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">We didn't know of course that</sentence></p><p><sentence id="121">this was a pogram (ph) that would last for an entire week.</sentence><sentence id="122">We thought that this would be over in twenty-four hours or that day or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="123">And at night we did go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh much against everybody's advice, but my father insisted that uh he was going to sleep in his own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he was not going to be intimidated.</sentence><sentence id="124">And we did go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that evening and uh slept in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">I don't believe that too much happened during the night.</sentence><sentence id="126">They may have knocked on our <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">We didn't answer uh the <span class="DLF">door</span>, but the next morning we took a few possessions and decided to go and stay with my grandmother for the duration of the pogrom again known to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="128">Uh I believe that either that day or the next day my father and the friend of the, their's uh Dr. , uh decided to go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I'm not sure how they made their way, to <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> called .</sentence><sentence id="129">It's outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">It was the for being prepared for uh <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and also a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">In fact I spent one summer there as a child.</sentence><sentence id="132">And uh this uh was surrounded by a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and I believe that however many Jews took refugee in spent the days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">Maybe the nights too.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="134">for some reason I guess the SS never got down there, and did not imprison anyone that was there.</sentence><sentence id="135">My father stayed there for the duration of the pogram, What they did is they manufactured uh leather gloves for work people.</sentence><sentence id="136">All kinds of gloves for different professions.</sentence><sentence id="137">And my father had designed a specific glove which was patented and I have the patent at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, which perhaps would, will become an artifact if the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> is interested in it.</sentence><sentence id="138">Uh he had designed a glove with a certain reinforcement which made these gloves more uh economical to use or longer lasting let's say, uh with certain reinforcements on the palm, and these were gloves for all kinds of industry.</sentence><sentence id="139">And in fact if anything his you know mere talking in the era of course after the big depression un in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, across the world I should say, uh and he had really with this business that he had built up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, worked his way up tremendously during the last few years, and ironically as it may sound because of the war industry that was taking place already at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, his orders and his business dropped quite considerably and uh until the Kristallnacht and when business sort of became impossible.</sentence><sentence id="140">Uh Jews were no longer allowed to .</sentence><sentence id="141">Un one other event that did take place and which unfortunakely in my book I made a mistake in the date, saying that it took place in August of 1939.</sentence><sentence id="142">It has been corrected, but nevertheless went down as "39, but obviously it took place in August of 1938, and that a decree by the government that all Jews, male and female, had to adopt a Jewish name.</sentence><sentence id="143">And you had to add your middle name to your name, the middle name.</sentence><sentence id="144">All women became Sarah and all men became <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">So that now my name became Johanna Yuta (ph) Sarah Gerechter and my mother was Alice Sarah Gerechter and my father was Siegbert Israel Gerechter.</sentence><sentence id="146">And it's interesting that I realized that even people like my own son and daughter-in-law never heard of this uh law that one can be forced to add a name to their existing name.</sentence><sentence id="147">And how come that people didn't become suspicious enough to just throw everything away but uh they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="148">Uh my father had maintained that he had been a uh high officer during World War I. He had the Iron Cross.</sentence><sentence id="149">He had received in 1935 a cross which was given only to all front line fighters, meaning people who for four years of the Ist World War spent it on the <span class="DLF">front line</span>, and how could the same men now deny him an existence or a livelihood and would throw him out.</sentence><sentence id="150">I mean that was something . [</sentence><sentence id="151">believe that it was part of the psychology played by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="152">Psychology played a very very uh important and powerful role I think can tell from the fact that people would be deported and yet panic.</sentence><sentence id="153">To be told that they were going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> or we were being resettled in the east and didn't know where they really were going to. .</sentence><sentence id="154">OK.</sentence><sentence id="155">Uh it now became</sentence></p><p><sentence id="158">obviously many of the other uh daily uh amenities of life.</sentence><sentence id="159">I'm a child.</sentence><sentence id="160">I'm panic- stricken or very fearful.</sentence><sentence id="161">The thing I expressed in my book, a feeling of constant fear.</sentence><sentence id="162">Uh I remember events such as uh, what do you call it, uh air raid alarms .</sentence><sentence id="163">Of course we Jews were not allowed to go to an air raid uh shelter, even at that stage of the game.</sentence><sentence id="164">But you had to uh comply with and you were being tested whether that was well enough done so not a not a ray of light would come out.</sentence><sentence id="165">And we had to stay in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">The sirens would go.</sentence><sentence id="167">The uh uh fire department would do whatever they were instructed to do, and I remember a tremendous fear, feeling of fear.</sentence><sentence id="168">I mean I can feel that fear even today.</sentence><sentence id="169">I think I can feel the fear that I experienced the night that we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to uh back to our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> Kristallnach the feeling that my father would be taken.</sentence><sentence id="170">I think that I had enough understanding to realize what that would mean.</sentence><sentence id="171">And the tremendous fear .</sentence><sentence id="172">Uh this used to I guess that goes way back to 1935, "36 when the big rallies or uh big taking place speak to his supporters, to his uh the masses of and these would be broadcast on the <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">And people would put on their radios, and I remember but this must have been summer time.</sentence><sentence id="174"><span class="DLF">Windows</span> were open and I was supposed to go to sleep, and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again.</sentence><sentence id="175">I could feel it like I felt it as a child .</sentence><sentence id="176">So the feelings uh the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, I don't think that anybody every really can completely forget that kind of fear.</sentence><sentence id="177">Well the world became very insecure as I said.</sentence><sentence id="178">Uh many friends began to leave.</sentence><sentence id="179">Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and three children, and my parents trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="180">Now the obvious was of course to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">My two aunts by now were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">They had began to send us affadivits and all the supporting affidavits and uh supporting letters and security and whatever else the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> demanded, and we were registered, but because of the uh trust that my father had, and this here, I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long, and perhaps even felt, had a feeling of ... ... and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again and I could feel it like I felt it as a child of six and seven and eight.</sentence><sentence id="183">So the fear existed and the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, and I don't think that anybody ever really can completely forget that kind of a fear.</sentence><sentence id="184">Well, the world became very insecure.</sentence><sentence id="185">As I said uh many friends began to leave.</sentence><sentence id="186">Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and the three children, and my parents, were trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="187">Now the obvious was of course to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">My two aunts by now were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="189">They had began to send us affidavits and all the supporting affidavits and and supporting letters and securities and whatever else the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> demanded, and we were registered.</sentence><sentence id="190">But because of the uh trust that my father had, and this and this here I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long time, and perhaps even felt, fear, had a feeling of of un grudge against my parents for this feeling of security that they expre...that they had for living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I didn't understand it until recent years when I have read many stories of other people like myself who came from German families and where the feeling was exactly the same, where the attitude was the same.</sentence><sentence id="191">They were Germans.</sentence><sentence id="192">They had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for generations.</sentence><sentence id="193">Uh I know that my mother's family, I myself in my book have traced back the family for a little bit over two hundred years, and I haven't done a very</sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">thorough job, so I'm sure that I can go back much further.</sentence><sentence id="197">Uh my father's family even though he was born in which was the heart of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, uh under American law after the after the uh Ist World War it had been ceased (ph) to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polish quota, which caused all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="198">But nevertheless, he in his own heart was a German and had always been a German.</sentence><sentence id="199">And uh I have to say that today perhaps I can understand it much better that they had such trust that this could never happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="200">Uh I don't know how, I don't really know how much would an American Jew who has been here for several generations, if the same situation would confront him, though he has the experience of only fifty years ago in the in the back of his mind, but how much would he feel that something so drastic, so total and so inhuman could take place.</sentence><sentence id="201">I I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="202">But nevertheless this was the feeling.</sentence><sentence id="203">So that my parents did not register very early for the American quota.</sentence><sentence id="204">My mother and I both having been born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had not, no great problems.</sentence><sentence id="205">The quota, our quota came up very quickly, and we could have left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> several times before leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">I think we were called to the <span class="BUILDING">Consule</span> at least twice if not three times.</sentence><sentence id="207">However, my father according to American law, went on the Polish quota, and that was a small quota and this was, and he had a high number because many eastern European Jews had registered much much earlier.</sentence><sentence id="208">And of course we weren't going to leave without him, so needless to say each time we gave up our quota and someone else possibly left in our stead.</sentence><sentence id="209">I believe did.</sentence><sentence id="210">So that here in the, and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">They had to also find another <span class="BUILDING">asylum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">And it was exactly that.</sentence><sentence id="213">It was a search for an <span class="BUILDING">asylum</span> no matter where.</sentence><sentence id="214">And uh the passibilities were very very slim.</sentence><sentence id="215">They thought of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">Well <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> required quite a substantial amount of money as the security deposit for every one that uh entered <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="217">I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't think that my parents could have afforded that, and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family, so that we had to find other ways out.</sentence><sentence id="218">Uh my father I believe had uh - no, not I believe, I know - had cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">Was very difficult to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">You had to prove that you were some how or other uh connected professionally to agriculture, and of course that he couldn't prove.</sentence><sentence id="221">He was a business man, through and through.</sentence><sentence id="222">So that was out.</sentence><sentence id="223">So somehow, and I'm not quite a hundred percent sure how this <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> uh possibility surfaced, but what I had heard always was my mother had met the Albanian attache to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at a bridge party, and uh during the conversation it turned out that he was about to be married and wanted to go ona honey...his honeymoon to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">And uh my parents and the Meyer family lent him some money.</sentence><sentence id="225">He got us in return, perhaps not in return - I don't want to make it sound that this was a bribery.</sentence><sentence id="226">I think that he really and honestly was able to officially give them visas to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">And uh Dr. Meyer and my mother flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> for the day, and they obtained the uh Albanian visas and our passports or a letter - I'm not quite sure.</sentence><sentence id="228">At any rate uh - I'm hesitating on this flight business because my grandmother was not allowed to know at that point that my mother was going to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> back to her would have been absolute uh disaster.</sentence><sentence id="229">I mean how does anybody go into an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">But nevertheless when she came safely back the same evening she was told and she sighed relief that she didn't know before.</sentence><sentence id="231">At any rate we did get visas.</sentence><sentence id="232">Uh and uh now the process of leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> mysteriously began.</sentence><sentence id="233">My recollections on that are very very sad.</sentence><sentence id="234">Number one I had to leave Grandmother because we could not think of taking, well in today's world perhaps her age was not all that advanced - she was in her mid60's.</sentence><sentence id="235">Today I'm pretty close to that and I</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="239">consider myself not an old person, but in those days I think one could not think of taking her to a primative country like <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and this is all we knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">Uh she was left alone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> with an older sister.</sentence><sentence id="241">Uh her, the chances that she she alone would still make it to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> were fairly good, although she too by coincidence was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="242">I believe that my grandfather from my father's family and her family knew each other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> of course.</sentence><sentence id="243">Uh but uh at any rate she was on the Polish quota as well and we took a chance to just leave her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="244">That was very sad.</sentence><sentence id="245">Uh my my parents uh now proceeded to unravel all their affairs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">We had to give up our <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">We had to give our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">Uh and we thought that we would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, transfer our documents with the American Consule to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consule</span> in , which indeed we did and that we would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> for a period of maybe four months, five months, half a year.</sentence><sentence id="249">Uh I'm not even sure that they thought it would take that long.</sentence><sentence id="250">Considering and uh thinking back of the amount of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> that we took with us, and the kind of clothes we took with us, it was really considered only a matter of months that we would be in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">Uh the rest of our belongings, that which we were allowed to take out, because here we are, January, February, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="252">We're not allowed to take out any silver.</sentence><sentence id="253">We're not allowed to take out mare than 10 marks per person.</sentence><sentence id="254">Uh we're not allowed to take out any jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="255">We're not allowed to take out many other things, nothing that was newly purchased.</sentence><sentence id="256">I mean there were very very specific uh rules and regulations.</sentence><sentence id="257">I believe that in my papers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> I even have lists of things my parents took with them.</sentence><sentence id="258">I have I think a document that states uh that you're only allowed to take out things that were purchased one year prior to your uh immigration and things of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="259">I mean everything was made very clear.</sentence><sentence id="260">They packed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> (ph) under the supervision of German uh officials.</sentence><sentence id="261">Everything was checked, what went in there, and uh these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifts</span> were left in the storage of the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> with the intention that as soon as we would arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we would send for these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">I believe that at the time the rule was that you could not just simply send off your lift to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and it makes sense, because I think the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or the harbor of New York would have been flooded with lifts of people who unfortunately never made it themselves there.</sentence><sentence id="263">So our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> was left in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, in the uh harbor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and uh we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> on uh I believe the date was the 23rd of February, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="264">At least this is what the official exit document that I have states.</sentence><sentence id="265">Uh my father had a very hard time detaching himself from literally thousands of letters, documents, photographs, etc.</sentence><sentence id="266">It was impossible that he could take all of these things that were very dear to him and that meant so much to him.</sentence><sentence id="267">These were letters still written by his mother to him when he was in the war.</sentence><sentence id="268">Uh his younger brother had fallen for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> eighteen days before the end of World War I. He's buried somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">Uh his mother, as I stated before, already died when she was uh a young woman in February of 1919.</sentence><sentence id="270">She had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to wait for him as he arrived.</sentence><sentence id="271">He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in November of 1918, he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks (ph) and went into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and never came back from the war until February 1919.</sentence><sentence id="272">Uh she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">She awaited him at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">And sometime during that period she contracted as I said the Spanish Influenza.</sentence><sentence id="275">She went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> and died very shortly thereafter.</sentence><sentence id="276">And he could not even go to her funeral because he was a German soldier, or ex-soldier.</sentence><sentence id="277"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> by this time was Polish and I don't think that he got uh a permit to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">Uh I believe a little bit later on, probably 1920, everyone who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> was given the option to opt for either the Polish citizenship or German citizenship, and of course my grandfather uh opted and and part of the other family opted for the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="282">German citizenship, and they all went to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">So as of 1920, I believe that uh all whoever was left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.395" long="16.857">Posen</span> of the family Gerechter and whatever else their names were all went to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="284">But to come back to our own family, so I remember so very distinctly my father making arrangements with the superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived, that he could use the <span class="INT_SPACE">furnace room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and burn all what he couldn't take with him.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="285"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Papers</span>, documents, etc.</sentence><sentence id="286">etc.</sentence><sentence id="287">He took some things with him, but very few.</sentence><sentence id="288">We were so limited in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baggage</span> and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> that it was really uh very difficult to decide what to take and what not to take.</sentence><sentence id="289">Uh it came to the point where my mother and father had to go to the uh customs officials and give them, hand them over, their silverware, their candlesticks, their...anything, any objects in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that were made of silver, none of which could be taken along.</sentence><sentence id="290">The uh cutlery and uh you know, whatever uh else was of silver in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="291">Uh I do remember my mother going out and being permitted to buy three sets of cutlery, of uh silver-plated cutlery to be taken with us.</sentence><sentence id="292">One for each of us, and nothing more.</sentence><sentence id="293">And her jewelry.</sentence><sentence id="294">When they came to the customs official, someone recognized her, an elderly gentlemen and it turned out that one time he worked for my grandfather, possibly ten or fifteen years earlier in his business.</sentence><sentence id="295">And because he recognized her, he allowed her to take just a few extra items along.</sentence><sentence id="296">They were pa...that is to say extra items of jewelry, because otherwise all they were permitted really was their wedding rings, and as I said, a set of uh three sets of cutlery for each of us.</sentence><sentence id="297">Uh she was allowed very few additional items, and those items were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, packed in a sealed little package.</sentence><sentence id="298">I still see the package in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="299">It was very small and it was sealed with seal-locker, actually sealed, and I guess included was a list of items that were in it.</sentence><sentence id="300">And a copy of that list, when we finally left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and crossed the Pass into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, that list was over there with the customs official, officials.</sentence><sentence id="301">My parents were taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when we uh passed across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and uh the package at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was opened up and they compared the list and contents of that package with the list that they had received.</sentence><sentence id="302">That's how strict things were handled in those days.</sentence><sentence id="303">At any rate, the day of departure arrived.</sentence><sentence id="304">I remember all night long my parents were still packing.</sentence><sentence id="305">I remember the last night in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">Uh the farewell to toys and everything else and of course the very very sad farewell to my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="307">I still re...see her standing on her <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and waving at us as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> drove away and took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="308">We left from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> called and uh I took a doll with me.</sentence><sentence id="309">I took a ball with me.</sentence><sentence id="310">I remember a little pin that my grandmother had given me and a few other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toys</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="311">And uh we traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and slept the first night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and continued the next day to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">That is to say we crossed the <span class="DLF">Pass</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">My parents, not everyone but at random, people were taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>...out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and uh some of them were even uh bodily examined.</sentence><sentence id="314">Now my mother was taken into one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and my father in another, totally stripped and totally examined and my mother ca---and I was left with the Meyers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">For some reason the Meyers were not examined.</sentence><sentence id="316">As I said, people were taken at random.</sentence><sentence id="317">And uh remember my mother coming back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and telling us her experience and among other things that the woman who examined her, touched her hair and said what do you have in there, and she said permanent, and uh the woman said don't answer me so fresh.</sentence><sentence id="318">Well, we finally crossed the and uh - look, some people smuggled things out.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="319">That's for sure, and we know that and it perhaps even saved their lives.</sentence><sentence id="320">It was money smuggled or perhaps between pages of books and it was uh people had false bottoms to their pocketbooks or suitcases - who knows what.</sentence><sentence id="321">I know that my parents at that point were fearful enough not to do that because the results were well-known.</sentence><sentence id="322">They had friends who</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="326">did this, and whose husband ended up for many years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, and uh we left with the ten marks per person.</sentence><sentence id="327">We left with the little package that was packaged in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and that's all we had with us.</sentence><sentence id="328">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> the next day, and uh here we didn't know what we would be doing because the ten marks by now had been used up the one night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and uh the Meyer family of five and the three stood on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> and really didn't know where to turn.</sentence><sentence id="329">To our great surprise, uh there were Italian students who uh who were organized by the Jewish Committee uh of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and apparently in many such centers of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, these students had made it their business to be there and uh receive German or other immigrants that were fleeing <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">Well, I remember two students taking us in hand, taking us to a beautiful beautiful <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">And caring for us for an entire week until we were able to receive money from our relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and the same went for the Meyer family.</sentence><sentence id="332">Uh the money had to be uh dispatched, and I guess in those days uh telegram was already in existence of course, but I don't know how quickly it went.</sentence><sentence id="333">But we were for an entire week taken care of my these students in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> who also took us around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, showed us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span>, fed us, took us to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span>, and just took care of us until we were able to uh pay for our uh passage for, first of all from for our ticket, railroad ticket from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="334">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">Now, we were not allowed to pay for these two tripls, because this was out of <span class="REGION">territorial Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">They would not allow us to pay with German money in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for these two tickets, which would have made life a lot easier and, but this were all calculated on the part of the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="337">Uh of course we all know that uh supposedly all the money that was uh left and all the jewelry and everything else, all belongings, were put into a socalled uh account, or whatever it was called.</sentence><sentence id="338">And uh supposedly someday this all was supposed to come back.</sentence><sentence id="339">Of course it never did.</sentence><sentence id="340">By the way, speaking of the lift in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, many many years later uh my parents already were no longer alive, and the <span class="BUILDING">German court</span> somehow found out that uh indeed there was a lift stored in a certain man's uh <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> uh which had been distributed.</sentence><sentence id="341">The contents of not only our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> but I suppose many other people's uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifts</span>, had been distributed to so-called bombed-out German families.</sentence><sentence id="342">And I received the glorious amount of $400 American dollars, or was it 400 marks - I'm not quite sure anymore - uh maybe sometime in the early early "60's as compensation for the lift.</sentence><sentence id="343">Anyway, we're now uh in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">As I said we uh were taken care, beautifully taken care of by these people and it is only weeks ago now that I read in a book written by a woman called Susan , .</sentence><sentence id="345">She writes about the Italian Jews and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and its Jews, etd.</sentence><sentence id="346">It's a fantastic book I think.</sentence><sentence id="347">Unfortunately, uh she doesn't mention <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> at all, and I'm trying to get in touch with her which I haven't succeeded in.</sentence><sentence id="348">Uh I think it's a pity that she doesn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and the Italian role there.</sentence><sentence id="349">But uh she is describing this organization of Italians who are helping Jews who come across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to make their life more pleasant and easier.</sentence><sentence id="350">And I never realized that this was a nationally organized uh group of people who who did this for a long period of time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="351">Anyway, we now leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>, and immediately take uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the money that we could afford was only for sturge (ph) or storge (ph) or whatever you call it, in a pl...in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, that is to say down in the in the bottom of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">We crossed for twelve hours into <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">Everybody was seasick.</sentence><sentence id="354">This is uh the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Adriatic Sea</span> in March - can be rough and it was rough I assume.</sentence><sentence id="355">And we arrived very early the next morning in the <span class="DLF">port</span> or what you might call a port of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="356">My first impression...</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</sentence><sentence id="362">1 Tape #2 ...We arrived on March Ist, 1939, in the early, early hours of the morning.</sentence><sentence id="363">We went up on board and the <span class="DLF">site</span> that uh we saw was one of extreme depression.</sentence><sentence id="364">It was a one <span class="DLF">dock</span> and <span class="DLF">port</span>, piles and piles, heaps and heaps of charcoal on the <span class="DLF">pier</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">It was pouring rain.</sentence><sentence id="366">The black water was everywhere, running all over the <span class="DLF">pier</span> from the charcoal.</sentence><sentence id="367">There were few uh Albanians, for the most part gypsies because they use...used to use gypsies for their heavy work and for carrying and so on.</sentence><sentence id="368">Covering their, and this I kept seeing it all through the years whenever it rained, these people would use as a protection just the jute bags over their heads and this is was the sight that met our eyes.</sentence><sentence id="369">It was really really depressing.</sentence><sentence id="370">And I remember my mother crying bitterly and saying I am not leaving this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="371">I am going to straight back to .</sentence><sentence id="372">She absolutely could not envision how she would ever be able to set foot to this kind of a unbelievably depressing uh sight.</sentence><sentence id="373">Well again to our surprise, because we really had no idea what was expecting us in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, uh there were other immigrants, European immigrants already in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, and someone from the <span class="DLF">pier</span> called up in German, are there any German Jews, are there any Jews on board?</sentence><sentence id="374">And uh we were very happy that this gentleman who had already been in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, this was his job to be there every day when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> arrived to see whether there would be refugees on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="375">And uh so he helped us get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and uh take us to one of the local <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="376">Well ho...<span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> is an overstatement of facts, but that's what they were called.</sentence><sentence id="377">Exceeding...everything was exceedingly primative.</sentence><sentence id="378">Uh we had, coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, uh hygiene being the epitomy of our lives and so on, this was really unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="379">But nevertheless here we were.</sentence><sentence id="380">Uh I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="381">We children perhaps because of our age, by this time I had just turned my eighth birthday in December before we left, and uh the uh children of the family Meyer, one was younger - I believe he was only five - and uh the other, the the girls - one was a year older than myself and one was exactly the same age.</sentence><sentence id="382">So I don't know ta what extent we could empathasize with the feeling our parents experienced.</sentence><sentence id="383">I think that to us some of this was exciting because it was new and it was different and and it was just all uh a new experience for us children.</sentence><sentence id="384">I think at this point we uh we were certainly very insecure because we didn't know what was facing us or what <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would be like or the usual things that children do - toys, we had almost none with us, just what we could carry in our arms or our little bag that each one of us had over their shoulder, and uh I do remember very well that for many many years the one thing that I missed so terribly was my school bag, and I always had in the back of my mind, well one day when I get to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, my school bag was .</sentence><sentence id="385">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we used to wear the school bag on your on your back.</sentence><sentence id="386">I had some particular like for this I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="387">I don't know exactly why, but that was so important to me that I did not have that with me.</sentence><sentence id="388">Uh another thing I had received as a gift from an uncle of my mother's a <span class="BUILDING">doll house</span> that he had made himself and of couse I had to leave that behind, needless to say, and that was a tremendous uh and I missed it very badly.</sentence><sentence id="389">Well, these are the things that children of that age I think we experiencing.</sentence><sentence id="390">The lack of the uh ususal, the schooling, the friends, the <span class="BUILDING">playgrounds</span>, the toys, the family the grandparents, etc.</sentence><sentence id="391">Uh but the other insecurities of where does the next meal come from or where are we going to live and where are we going to sleep and so on which parents have to worry about, I think that didn't quite trickle down to us at that point yet.</sentence><sentence id="392">At any rate we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, so called <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, very filthy, very dir...very much infested by bedbugs and lice and the whole gambit, and uh the other immigrants and there were at that point I believe something like sixty people there.</sentence><sentence id="393">They were all from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, mostly</sentence><sentence id="395">2 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="396">Uh had rented or I should I should start a little bit differently at this point.</sentence><sentence id="397">There were Albanian Jews and that is to say there were two families originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> who had lived for many years in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and they were considered Albanian Jews.</sentence><sentence id="398">Uh there names were uh Kohn (ph) and Levy (ph).</sentence><sentence id="399">They ran rather large <span class="BUILDING">dry goods stores</span> and uh they were weal...very Jews.</sentence><sentence id="400">Their origin as I say was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solonika</span> (ph) I believe and uh when these other people had arrived a little bit earlier than we, I don't believe that anybody was there more than maybe a year longer than we.</sentence><sentence id="401">In other words in 1938 I believe is immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> started.</sentence><sentence id="402">Uh these people had sort of assumed the role of uh to the highest to the Joint Distribution in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">Made contact with them, and they were sending American dollars to these two families who in turn gave us the Albanian equivalent of this money.</sentence><sentence id="404">But in all these years they made very nice uh currency out of these Jews that came to to to escape <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="405">Never mind.</sentence><sentence id="406">At any rate uh these people had organized themselves in uh they had rented a very very large <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, call it a uh a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span>, and uh these sixty people, more or less, were living, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> per family, in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a very hugh <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">communal kitchen</span> of course, and uh they had uh organized in such a way that several women each day would take turns at cooking and preparing the food and several men would take turns every day in purchasing uh the produce etc.</sentence><sentence id="407">and prepare the two meals.</sentence><sentence id="408">They were in the process of renting a second such <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the first one but had not completed the arrangements yet so that we for example uh had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the original <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and had to live in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">So it was us and uh the Meyer family and there were a couple of other couples or single people who in the meantime were staying in one or the other of these <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="410">I think at that time there were just two. ( )</sentence><sentence id="411">One was called .The other one was called, and uh but for meals we had to go everyday to this <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> which was perhaps not a long way.</sentence><sentence id="412">I don't really recall.</sentence><sentence id="413">I do recall that as a child it was a trecherous waly to walk.</sentence><sentence id="414">You have to remember that uh <span class="DLF">roads</span> as such weren't reallly known in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and it was all very uh muddy.</sentence><sentence id="415">This was the rainy season in February and March into April, and uh we had to go twice a day for meals to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, to the uh <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="416">And it wasn't until a few months later, and I'm not quite sure exactly whether it was May or June that the second <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> had been rented and when we could move, be moved in there.</sentence><sentence id="417">OK.</sentence><sentence id="418">Uh so this us procedure here went on all through March and into April.</sentence><sentence id="419">April 5th, 1939, we woke up to a barrage of cannon uh shots.</sentence><sentence id="420">And we didn't quite know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="421">We were told immediately that the royal family had just uh the Queen of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had just delivered a uh an heir to the throne and uh they were shooting .</sentence><sentence id="422">Well that was very nice and the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, King uh offered that these sixty or maybe by now sixty-five or seventy immigrants Albanian citizenship in honor of the birth of his son.</sentence><sentence id="423">Well, it never came to this, which there were times when we wished it had taken place but in the end history proved that it would have been terrible if it had happened, because we would never have gotten out of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="424">.Two days later we again were awoken by terrible uh noises of artilleries shooting but this time it was the real thing.</sentence><sentence id="425">Italians had landed in .</sentence><sentence id="426">Uh it was the week of Passover.</sentence><sentence id="427">Passover was early that particular year.</sentence><sentence id="428">I believe I looked up in my book earlier and I believe that the Seder night was uh on the 3rd or 4th of uh April or 5th of April that year and uh there were rumors that something was happ...going to happen and indeed they had told us that day, on the 6th of uh April, not to come back for supper that night but to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they gave us some food to take back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with us.</sentence><sentence id="429">And uh sure enough on the 7th in the morning, 7th of April, 1939, the Italians had landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, had occupied the <span class="DLF">port</span> part of .</sentence><sentence id="430">The fighting in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> took uh maybe three, four, five hours at the most.</sentence><sentence id="431">I don't</sentence><sentence id="433">3 remember, not too much.</sentence><sentence id="434">But we were staying in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and of course this was one of the uh uh <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> very close to the <span class="DLF">port</span> and uh altogether how many <span class="DLF">streets</span> were in and uh we didn't quite know where to run for shelter because uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> had all large <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the shooting was going on and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were being broken, uh the panels were were falling into the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> so we ran up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">The <span class="DLF">stairs</span> were a windowless area at that time.</sentence><sentence id="436">Well, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning the uh Italians finally came into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and took us into the nearby uh ( ) solid back.</sentence><sentence id="437">It was a solid built <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="438">Uh my mother and I were taken over, followed by my father by some Italian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="439">They were all very kind and very accommodating and very helpful, but right in front of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was a machine gun and a dgad Albanian soldier over whom we almost fell.</sentence><sentence id="440">Uh we were kept in the all day long, and uh in the mean time of course the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> uh abandoned their fighting.</sentence><sentence id="441">The Albanians didn't stand any chance whatsoever and the war was over within a few hours and the Italians were now in possession of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">It's been, it was part of the Italian empire such as , , or parts of <span class="REGION">Africa</span>, etc.</sentence><sentence id="443">Uh as far as we were concerned of course the Italians really were to us excellent, wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="444">Uh the word anti- Semitism did not have, not only didn't exist, didn't have any meaning to them.</sentence><sentence id="445">They didn't know what it meant.</sentence><sentence id="446">Uh we were Germans at least as far as they were concerned.</sentence><sentence id="447">When we timidly would tell them they were Jews, their replies would always be well, we have Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they're Italian citizens.</sentence><sentence id="448">Some of them are even in the Facist party, which of course is true.</sentence><sentence id="449">We all know by now that there were Italian Jews who were very ardent uh supporters of Facism and such.</sentence><sentence id="450">At any rate uh we as I said eventually moved into this other <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> and the Italians were there, and everything was good and fine and uh life went on and here we were waiting for our call-up to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> because we mustn't forget that this was still the ultimate uh aim.</sentence><sentence id="451">We only came here to stay for the few months it would take for the American consule to call us because our to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">Well, when the Italians occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, that of course was part of the Axis now, and the American consule left and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span>.</sentence><sentence id="453">I don't know exactly why because that was also uh <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was also uh the Axis but anyway, there was no longer an <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in and our papers and everything else went with them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and now we became, we got under the jurisdiction of the ( ) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span>.</sentence><sentence id="454">Uh the SS was well-known in those days.</sentence><sentence id="455">Each consule is oh can demand whatever he wants to demand as to security and ( ) uh guarantees that they will not become burdens to the American government.</sentence><sentence id="456">Indeed this is what happened, and of course we all know that ( ) could have come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, didn't come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> only because of this ( ) .</sentence><sentence id="457">At any rate we are now in the summer of 1939 and uh our papers are now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and so are the papers of the Meyer family.</sentence><sentence id="458">There were other people who also uh had uh these quota and affadavits to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and some did.</sentence><sentence id="459">Here and there children kept uh leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and ( ) other <span class="NPIP">places</span> such as <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and of course we know what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="460">A few, very few, went to uh went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="461">But among them were the Meyer family who in December of 1939 were called to the consule in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span>, did leave <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and eventually arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">Uh our quota was not up yet, and we were toying with the idea at one point why not leave with them and stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and wait for our quota, which could have been advantageous and maybe not.</sentence><sentence id="463">You can never tell.</sentence><sentence id="464">But we ultimately decided to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and await our call-up. (</sentence><sentence id="465">Pause) Life for me at this point was that there were a few other children.</sentence><sentence id="466">I think we were five kids altogether.</sentence><sentence id="467">In our world we walked, playing, goinlg to the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="468">Uh in the meantime our parents organized among themselves individuals who could teach us.</sentence><sentence id="469">My</sentence><sentence id="471">4 father gave us lessons.</sentence><sentence id="472">He was an amateur painter.</sentence><sentence id="473">I have some very lovely paintings of his in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="474">Uh he gave us lessons in art.</sentence><sentence id="475">I was not one of his pupils.</sentence><sentence id="476">Uh other people gave us uh lessons in arthimetic and writing and reading, but just to keep us occupied.</sentence><sentence id="477">But uh considering the fact that we all are under the impression that we are going to be there just for a few months of time, why bother sending these poor children to uh uh <span class="BUILDING">Albanian schools</span> and let them learn a language that was all the whole world over to speak and a difficult language at that.</sentence><sentence id="478">Uh why should we bother? (</sentence><sentence id="479">Pause) Uh the opinion of a few people who were there with children.</sentence><sentence id="480">Uh we the three Meyer children, myself, uh and I think so we were really just little kids.</sentence><sentence id="481">OK.</sentence><sentence id="482">Uh so what was my life like?</sentence><sentence id="483">Really very uh uneventful I could say.</sentence><sentence id="484">You know, we we did obviously uh play in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="485">We obviously Children will find ways .</sentence><sentence id="486">Uh eventually when it got to be , LONG .</sentence><sentence id="487">At any rate we uneventful life Uh we had a wonderful day.</sentence><sentence id="488">I remember the day very very well.</sentence><sentence id="489">The water was At any rate we got in the summer of 1939 and you have <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> Uh water was brought down by donkey in metal containers from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, from <span class="DLF">natural wells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="490">But they didn't, how shall I say, stupidly or uh ignorantly enough people didn't buy blocks of ice and put this into the drinking water in order to cool it.</sentence><sentence id="491">Well the blocks of ice were made from the regular water, so that by the time we got to drink the wonderful water from the <span class="DLF">wells</span>, it was infested with .</sentence><sentence id="492">And a lot of, many many people that summer became ill with typhoid fever.</sentence><sentence id="493">All of us had diarhhea and dysentery and and whatever you want to call it.</sentence><sentence id="494">All kinds of intestinal diseases.</sentence><sentence id="495">After a while obviously you built up uh antibodies and you you can fight the disease and also you learn to eat the things that the natives eat, one of which is that had uh apparently but in those days we wouldn't touch yougurt with a ten foot pole because we didn't, it wasn't exactly what we liked.</sentence><sentence id="496">Uh but we learned to like it.</sentence><sentence id="497">And it became a necessity.</sentence><sentence id="498">And anyway uh the next really traumatic experience in my life was the fact that uh my mother became terribly ill.</sentence><sentence id="499">We were still in the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> and it was still the summer of 1939, and she was diagnosed as being, suffering from uh typhoid fever and so she was ill for a good number of weeks before finally somebody decided well it has to be typhoid fever and she was taken by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in , , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital city</span> but at that time her condition had deteriorated tremendously.</sentence><sentence id="500">She ran very high temperatureq for almost a month during which time she was hallucinating constantly.</sentence><sentence id="501">She lost a tremendous amount of weight.</sentence><sentence id="502">At the end her disease she weighed something like uh 35 or 40 kilos and uh I didn't see her for uh almost four weeks, and my father feared the worst.</sentence><sentence id="503">In fact he didn't take me there because he was afraid that I wouldn't recognize her or or anytime he went there uh he woudn't try to.</sentence><sentence id="504">She she couldn't be persuaded to eat or drink any of the, again, what was in those days used really I mean, penecillin was nonexistent.</sentence><sentence id="505">Sulfur drugs were nonexistent yet.</sentence><sentence id="506">These are things that perhaps would have cured it quickly.</sentence><sentence id="507">Uh I'm not sure what drugs were being used, but the native cure for typhoid fever is yougurt and milk because both of them evidentally contain certain antibodies that can fight the bacteria.</sentence><sentence id="508">And she would have none of it.</sentence><sentence id="509">So she was for a very long time really very very ill.</sentence><sentence id="510">She did come out of it finally.</sentence><sentence id="511">Some Italian doctor in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> treated her, I'm not sure with what.</sentence><sentence id="512">When she finally came back to it was a tremendous joy for me, but in my own life the fear from was a tremendously real one.</sentence><sentence id="513">Uh I realized that she was very very sick and I realized that the chances that she would die were very real.</sentence><sentence id="514">And I have to tell you that uh I lost my mother very early in life.</sentence><sentence id="515">Uh she was fifty- seven years old.</sentence><sentence id="516">She died of cancer in 1976, in 1961.</sentence><sentence id="517">And uh that childhood fear of losing my mother had been with me all through uh that time, even though by this time I was myself</sentence><sentence id="519">5 a mother of three children and I was pregnant with my fourth child.</sentence><sentence id="520">But uh losing her was a very real real fear, and I, that I could lose her.</sentence><sentence id="521">I understood what this fear is all about.</sentence><sentence id="522">And and how all these years, from her illness, because she uh came back and maybe misdiagnosed, I'm not sure, but the doctors had claimed that she had come away with a heart defect, which maybe was never real.</sentence><sentence id="523">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="524">But uh she really never suffered from a heart disease but I think it had inbedded it so much in my mind, and heart meant death, so that I always feare for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="525">I was always afraid that she was working too hard even after we came to to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="526">That she was working too hard, that she was over- doing it, that; she may have a heart condition and that she may die of a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="527">Of course she didn't have a heart condition I don't believe uh and she suffered for about a year from cancer.</sentence><sentence id="528">She passed away as said at fifty-seven and really both my parents never recover from in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="529">My father, he did have a heart condition, did die at sixty-five, ten weeks after my mother.</sentence><sentence id="530">So at any rate, uh ( ) I finally had my mother back and it took her a long time to recover and to get her strength back.</sentence><sentence id="531">And in the meantime in December of "39 our .</sentence><sentence id="532">The Meyers left and so I really was left only with one little girl who wasn't even Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="533">Her mother wasn't Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="534">She had followed her husband who was a Jew from uh <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and we became very good friends, but uh we played together and we lived together that entire winter on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="535">Now I'am not sure at this point how many people in number, but we were still a substantial number of families who by this time had to move out of the two <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="536">Number one we weren't enough people anymore.</sentence><sentence id="537">I don't think that we were more than maybe twenty-five or thirty people, not families.</sentence><sentence id="538">Uh many had left as I said.</sentence><sentence id="539">Some to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">European cities</span> and some to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="540">The two <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> became too expensive and we had to give them up and what we did do was that in September of "39 we found ourselves little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> which belonged to affluent Albanians from the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> who would spend their summer vacations there, but in the winter were perfectly willing for I suppose reasonable rent to give us their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and that's what we did.</sentence><sentence id="541">And it was quite pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="542">Obviously for kids to live along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and in the wintertime and during uh uh storms and and it was fun.</sentence><sentence id="543">Uh well uh, but winter went quite alright except for one small incident and that was ( ) it was a fairly cold winter, "39 and "40, and the only means of uh heating in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> was with charcoal.</sentence><sentence id="544">I mean electricity was non-existent uh or means were unknown.</sentence><sentence id="545">People cook and people heat with charcoal.</sentence><sentence id="546">It's called in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="547">And uh the only other means was what is called which is uh little uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heating units</span> fed by uh petroleum, kerosene, but uh obviously you only cook on this.</sentence><sentence id="548">You can't heat with it, so it was a and even though we never slept with it, this particular night was a particularly cold one, and we left it in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> during the night.</sentence><sentence id="549">It's very dangerous because it gives off uh carbon monoxide.</sentence><sentence id="550">And uh for some reason or other I woke up in the middle of the night not feeling well, and woke up my mother who immediately realized that she also didn't feel well, and neither did my father and we almost had succumbed to uh carbon monoxide poisoning.</sentence><sentence id="551">He had the presence of mind, my father, to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> which led immediately led right out to the open into the uh onto the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and we really rolled down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and spent the entire night lying in, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> in the cold but recovered enough to in the morning be alright.</sentence><sentence id="552">But we had almost, this was almost it.</sentence><sentence id="553">And uh we stayed on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">We moved several times because meanwhile the owner...</sentence><sentence id="556">6 Tape #3 ... uh the situation was getting very cloudy.</sentence><sentence id="557">invade <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and we are not considered Jews who had escaped <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but we are considered uh non wanted enemy aliens.</sentence><sentence id="558">As enemy aliens we couldn't remain in a strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like was and we were deported to the interior of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called .</sentence><sentence id="559">And , <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> used by the uh Albanians and I suppose was used uh prior to this by the Turks, and prior to this perhaps even by the Romans, uh as a city of internment.</sentence><sentence id="560">Uh it is about, it's a <span class="DLF">valley</span>, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ina valley surrounded by very high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, and there are only certain passes that lead out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">And you don't even have to be behind but you simply cannot get out unless you go through certain mountain passes that are guarded.</sentence><sentence id="562">And uh they deported us, however many of us were left at that point, to the city of .</sentence><sentence id="563">We arrived there probably October or so.</sentence><sentence id="564">Yes, by the, by the high holidays we were already in .</sentence><sentence id="565">And at this point we were taken over by the Albanian government.</sentence><sentence id="566">Uh you have to remember that meanwhile the uh Axis had declared war, the entire Axis declared war on the United Stateq, uh and I skipped here something very important and that is that in uh May, May 8th, 1940, the American consul had finally invited us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> to receive our visas to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">Uh this was a very important episode in our lives and my parents immediately went to the <span class="BUILDING">ministry appropriate offices</span> in trying to get a permit to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, not so much to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> as to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and uh in the meantime the Italian government received instructions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> not to allow Jews to enter uh <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="568">And uh one other friend of ours in uh the same position as ourselves who had just been called to the American Consultate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and who had rece...gotten the entry visa into the uh <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, was already in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and was called off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> because the Italian official in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had received - he didn't want to open the tele...the telegram because he knew what was going to, what the contents was.</sentence><sentence id="569">Uh someone else forced him to open it and he had to take this man off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the man spent the rest of the war .</sentence><sentence id="570">But we didn't get that far because our invitation came maybe a week or two later and by that it had become official policy not to allow Jews officially into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="571">We were stuck.</sentence><sentence id="572">And that entire summer, the whole summer of 1940, my parents used up every last penny of money that they had had to travel between and to go to each and every one, anyone who would listen to them they would go to and try to get permission to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and it just - and there were wonderful Italian officials in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> who sincerely wanted to help, who tried every trick of the trade, and it just was not possible.</sentence><sentence id="573">I think my father's very last endeavor was to pay a visit to the Viceroy in.</sentence><sentence id="574">On uh a <span class="DLF">hilltop</span> in was a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of the King which of course was then occupied by what was called the Viceroy of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and uh who was a representative of the Emperor of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albjania</span>, and uh Yakamony (ph) was his name, and to present him with the case and ask for his personal intervention and help.</sentence><sentence id="575">And again uh it was quite unbelievable how uh wonderful, naive and helpful Italians really tried to be including the Viceroy.</sentence><sentence id="576">He happened to be in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and even though one of the guards who saw my father wanted to ask him to leave the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> because he was really not permitted, the Viceroy asked what does this gentlemen want.</sentence><sentence id="577">Please let him in.</sentence><sentence id="578">And my

winter, must have been at least four or five months later, one morning two , two Italian policemen came with a scroll under their arm, with the answer from the Viceroy, and in formal fashion opened or unwound this this this document and read that His Majesty, the</sentence><sentence id="581">7 Viceroy Yakamony regrets to inform the Senor Gerechter (ph) that he tried his utmost and that the official

unsuccessful.</sentence><sentence id="583">And we were stuck in .</sentence><sentence id="584">We tried uh yet during that same summer to uh get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984" long="23.771">Athens</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, hoping to perhaps get through the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="37.984"

be a very great .</sentence><sentence id="586">Didn't do anything to help us.</sentence><sentence id="587">We even at one time tried to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> but that too was impossible uh As I say, we were stuck for six and a half years.</sentence><sentence id="588">Every effort remained unsuccesful.</sentence><sentence id="589">OK.</sentence><sentence id="590">We arrive in in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> I'm sorry - skip that one.</sentence><sentence id="591">We arrived in uh in the fall of 1940, and uh the war with <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> started pretty soon thereafter with the Albanian government at this point uh took over the handling of these few Jews ( ).</sentence><sentence id="592">They uh issued a certain amount of for our support which was .</sentence><sentence id="593">They did uh provide us with <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> or did we have to pay for it - I'm not sure but we ended up to live in a very typical <span class="BUILDING">Turkish Moslem harem</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="594">A hugh, absolutely hugh hugh <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was constructed in a very strange way, at least to my way of thinking.</sentence><sentence id="595">I suppose this is how harems are constructed.</sentence><sentence id="596">Uh when I say hugh I mean hundreds of meters of uh <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> between the two sides of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="597">One one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was an <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> (ph) and on the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, another <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, was an anteroom.</sentence><sentence id="598">The <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> is where the guard of the harem ladies uh stays and the <span

kitchen</span>, which was unbelievably .</sentence><sentence id="600">It had a clay <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> I remember, and lots and lots of rats and mice walking around in it.</sentence><sentence id="601">Uh no uh bathroom facilities.</sentence><sentence id="602">None whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="603">An <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span>, even in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this, and uh I guess we did find an outdoor bathtub which I guess was used by the ladies of the <span class="BUILDING">harem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="604">At any rate by the time we arrived there this uh uh so called <span class="BUILDING">harem</span> which I assume at one point must have been the uh glorious and splendid ediface, was completely run down.</sentence><sentence id="605">There were hardly any uh glass uh panels in the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="606">I remember that we covered the uh <span class="DLF">windows</span> with blankets and ( ) a rather cold winter because this is much more northlernly located than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> and it was a very cold winter.</sentence><sentence id="607">Uh we were living, well for me first of all, it was fun again.</sentence><sentence id="608">A huge <span class="DLF">garden</span>, pomgranites (ph) grew in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="609">I picked them.</sentence><sentence id="610">And low and behold there was a dog, a female dog, a bitch in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> somewhere, who had given birth to these three little puppies.</sentence><sentence id="611">And must have happened just as we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="612">To me this was great excitement.</sentence><sentence id="613">Very good uh much fun, and uh one morning, by chance, I saw an Albanian boy who had chased the mother away and was about to take the puppies away.</sentence><sentence id="614">And the puppies were no more than uh maybe a week or two old - they didn't see yet.</sentence><sentence id="615">In other words they really were very little, and uh I guess my father must have told me that I may have one of these puppies.</sentence><sentence id="616">So I argued with this young uh boy and indeed he did give me the puppy that I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="617">It was a white and black puppy.</sentence><sentence id="618">And uh now I had my puppy.</sentence><sentence id="619">And I called my puppy Picholo (ph) even though it was a female and she should have been called Pichola (ph).</sentence><sentence id="620">But uh she remained <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Picholo</span> for the three and a half years of her life.</sentence><sentence id="621">And uh she grew into a very loving and lovely little dog, absolutely 57 varieties, but that didn't bother me.</sentence><sentence id="622">Uh we had to, we fed her literally with a uh milk bottle that belonged to one of my dolls I suppose and uh I don't even know where we got the milk from because I'm sure my mother didn't have enough milk for me, but I do remember that she bought the uh can of condensed milk and watered that down, and that's what the poor little puppy lived on for a while, and I also remember that one day she made some cream of wheat and it burned on these wonderful uh cooking facilities, and somehow that became food for this baby uh dog, puppy, for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="623">As long as it was sour - the</sentence><sentence id="625">8 burned cream of wheat.</sentence><sentence id="626">Anyway uh that was the uh central point of my life at this point.</sentence><sentence id="627">The dog was everything.</sentence><sentence id="628">The dog meant a great deal to me, and uh my parents very much liked this dog as well, so I didn't have any difficulties uh keeping the dog in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="629">I could keep the dog with me all the time.</sentence><sentence id="630">And uh I, we really became very close friends and it became uh a I had no other choice or friend.</sentence><sentence id="631">The dog was a very uh central part.</sentence><sentence id="632">Uh the war with <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, between <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and uh Ital...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greece</span> started very shortly thereafter.</sentence><sentence id="633">We lived very close to a <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span>, and uh what we didn't know was that the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> had been used by the Italians as a storage place for ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="634">The <span class="DLF">front line</span> was quite close.</sentence><sentence id="635">At night we could see the artillery fire, the flashing uh flaming up of of projectiles - we could see them.</sentence><sentence id="636">And uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of or this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of was bombed very very often.</sentence><sentence id="637">The first time we were bombed I remember very clearly I probably had a cold or something - I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="638">My father was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with me.</sentence><sentence id="639">One other of our uh friends was with us, and my mother had left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to get bread.</sentence><sentence id="640">OK.</sentence><sentence id="641">At this time things begin to be rationed.</sentence><sentence id="642">Now ration never became a great problem in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="643">There wasn't that much of a variety of food to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="644">Uh I cannot say that uh we lacked food because of ration.</sentence><sentence id="645">I can say we lacked food because of money and we couldn't afford anything, uh but it wasn't so much that there wasn't any food because of rationing.</sentence><sentence id="646">Uh the few things that there were, we you know, we could have obtained, but we really didn't have any money, and there was a period exactly around this time that from the money that the Albanian government gave us, and I have a great recollection that this was on the order of four or four and a half lechs (ph) a day and I do remember actually going hungry.</sentence><sentence id="647">There was a period that my mother stole fruit and tomatoes out of the <span class="DLF">neighbor's garden</span> because there was really no food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="648">Uh what eventually happened is again uh somehow through my relatives for a short period of time they were able to send some money via an <span class="BUILDING">Italian bank</span> and I'm I'm not, I can't remember how it was done uh to send us some money uh or through the Red Cross perhaps it was handled - Im" not sure.</sentence><sentence id="649">But I do remember receiving once or twice a little bit of money from the uh uh from the from from our relatives in uh in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and that helped us to bridge the <span class="DLF">gap</span>.</sentence><sentence id="650">I mentioned before the fact that my father was an amateur painter.</sentence><sentence id="651">Uh we had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> some beautiful paintings which are all gone - I mean obviously they all went with the rest of the stuff.</sentence><sentence id="652">Uh and his motifs had at that time been motly uh Judeic but I have a very good collection of the paintings in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concord</span>.</sentence><sentence id="653">Uh he decided that he had to make some money and uh somehow got the idea to paint uh store signs for Albanians.</sentence><sentence id="654">Very colorful with pictures of the merchandise that they were selling and believe it or not they really wanted them and they really bought them, and that helped us tremendously.</sentence><sentence id="655">And for quite a while he uh was able to sort of uh put some food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> through making these uh signs and and painting these these signs for people.</sentence><sentence id="656">He later on really went back and painting and uh I have in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span>, and my children also have some paintings that were done by him, still while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="657">Uh he did paint uh in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when he came uh to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in "46, "47, but uh this uh did help us along, but I still remember very well the couple of weeks where we actually did not have any food uh on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="658">Uh we uh some Ital...Albanian families became very friendly, our neighbors, and uh even invited us to the uh Moslem festival of Ramadan (ph).</sentence><sentence id="659">Of course today, living in in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, we always know when Ramadan takes place, and uh uh being that they go according to a lunar calendar and don't adjust their calendar it can come out any time of the year.</sentence><sentence id="660">Uh that year I guess it was sort of winter time, and uh it uh well it's the uh four weeks of fasting, but the two days at the end of uh this fasting period are great festivities and festivities are mostly food.</sentence><sentence id="661">And uh they</sentence><sentence id="663">9 have some very lovely, as we learned there and uh it's very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="664"><span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> is (TECHNIC'AL CONVERSATION).</sentence><sentence id="665">OK.</sentence><sentence id="666">At any rate uh they took them with us to the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> and they uh treated us as uh their guests and they're exceedingly hospitable and they sent us frequently to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="667">Uh and we remained in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for I believe at least half a year if not more, but the situation with the bombardment on the part of the Allies, Eng...uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British planes</span>, air, the British Air, Royal Air Force planes came over to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> detracted from that point.</sentence><sentence id="668">I was ill that day and my mother had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to get bread because there were only certain places where they distributed bread during the day, uh and my father saw these five or seven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> in the <span class="DLF">sky</span>, and no sooner had he seen them, then they started throwing bombs.</sentence><sentence id="669">There was no <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="670">Absolutely no shelter, real <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> as we came to know them.</sentence><sentence id="671">Uh nobody knew what to believe was happening.</sentence><sentence id="672">The aim was the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> because of the ammunition and possibly other parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> also had ammunition and uh the soldiers uh were you know sent back to the <span class="DLF">lines</span> into where they would rest for a few days, so this became very much a target, a daily target.</sentence><sentence id="673">Our only shelter became a very thick <span class="BUILDING">stone building</span>, that's the only way I can describe it, which the Moslems used to wash their dead.</sentence><sentence id="674">Uh and uh that was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="675">It is windowless and it was not very far from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but during the night, or anytime, we had to run for shelter to this one uh <span class="BUILDING">hut</span>, blut it's a very very uh solidly built uh <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> out of out of very hugh stones.</sentence><sentence id="676">Uh but the situation became such that uh they would come eight or ten times a day to bomb.</sentence><sentence id="677">I mean you couldn't go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="678">You couldn't undress.</sentence><sentence id="679">There were weeks we wouldn't undress because in the middle of the night you would have to run several times.</sentence><sentence id="680">Uh it became such that you couldn't dare uh undress yourself to even wash yourself in the basin in your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because they would come to bomb.</sentence><sentence id="681">Uh one day a high Italian official came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and my mother, not being bashful, approached him in the parade and said it's impossible for us to remain here.</sentence><sentence id="682">I have a little child, and uh could we get permission, because here we were sent here by the Italian governing forces, uh could I get permission to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was called , also small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">Even a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">But there was nothing as strategic or military about it.</sentence><sentence id="685">And he said come Monday morning to .</sentence><sentence id="686">I will give you a permit.</sentence><sentence id="687">She did.</sentence><sentence id="688">He did give her the permit, and we went, we moved once again to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called .</sentence><sentence id="689">Well, we all know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="690">The Italians dreadfully failed in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="691">The Germans landed on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span>, and several other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and occupied all of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, and I believe by June or July of that year, 1941, ( ) the was was over and uh we were given permission to return to We could go back to , so that was we were no longer undesirable aliens or enemy aliens and uh we had had enough of these uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="692">Now I have to add here that uh was so infested with mosquitos ( ) my mother and I came down with uh very severe cases of malaria.</sentence><sentence id="693">Somehow my father uh escaped that, but uh my mother had just barely recovered from ( ) and I was eventually trelated with ( ) medication and I will come to that later.</sentence><sentence id="694">At any rate, ( ) was not very long, maybe two or three months and then eventually we were allowed hack into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">Now at this point there is war everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="696">Uh the Joint no longer can support us in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="697">They no longer had uh could contact or connections.</sentence><sentence id="698">The Albanian government is no longer responsible for us because now we have left the city of internment and uh we uh went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span>, found ourselves a little uh what shall I call it - really only a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and and a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> uh in a on a <span class="DLF">peasant's farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="699">The peasants lived in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we lived in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="700">And there was an <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs room</span> and <span class="DLF">porch</span> as well.</sentence><sentence id="701">But we were really about a kilometer or two away from the <span class="DLF">highway</span>, on the other side of the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="703">0 uh I'm only describing it because eventually this becomes ( ) and the Italians were in possession of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> of course.</sentence><sentence id="704">This is the summer of 1941.</sentence><sentence id="705">Uh many Italians did not sympathize with the Facist government and who therefore were not interested to serve in the armies, or who had been already in the African war and no longer were interested in fighting another war, could, I understood at that time, volunbeer to do uh Army or military service in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> in the capacity of uh to supply the army in the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were staying or just, I don't know - I'm really not quite sure.</sentence><sentence id="706">But there were a great deal of need for ( ).</sentence><sentence id="707">There's no railroad system in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> or very primative one.</sentence><sentence id="708">I I'm not even sure that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> or not.</sentence><sentence id="709">I think th,ere <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Railroad</span> was transported uh charcoal to the various <span class="NPIP">places</span>, but this was not a uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">I think toda,y there is such a thing, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, out there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="711">All the transportation Albania basically was conducted by old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="712">There were almost no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="713">When the Italians came with the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and uh uh food supplies, charcoal supplies and whatever uh military supplies were needed, they took care of them, so that they were living along the whole, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="714">Now this was no longer a question of Albanians wanting to rent their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="715">They were rather uh requisitioned by the Italians for their uh truck drivers, and many of them even came with their families to to spend the duration of the, what they thought the duration of the war would now be.</sentence><sentence id="716">END OF TAPE OK.</sentence><sentence id="717">Uh we were back I believe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span>.</sentence><sentence id="718">We were, OK, at this point uh we were no longer being supported as I said by the Joint.</sentence><sentence id="719">We were no longer supported by the uh uh Albanian government and uh working permit as such was impossible to obtain.</sentence><sentence id="720">You have to remember that this is a very small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with a very limited uh industry and very limited resources of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="721">Uh and so my father once again resorted to his painting.</sentence><sentence id="722">Uh he continued actually what he had started in , uh in , to paint the store signs and uh he even got.some uh jobs with the uh highway department to do signs where construction was taking place and things of this sort.</sentence><sentence id="723">However, that didn't really amount to mu...enough money and at this time, at this point, we were living out of the, out in the uh on the uh <span class="DLF">farm</span>, if you want to call it a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, but that's really what it was, and uh together with yet another family, friends of ours, and uh the two families, my parents and these people, Mundle (ph) was their name, Feenie (ph) and Walter (ph) Mundle, uh decided that they were going to uh wash laundry for Italian uh truck drivers.</sentence><sentence id="724">Uh if I think back of the uh laundry business, I somehow have to chuckle.</sentence><sentence id="725">The automatic washers and the automatic dryers and the running water and the hot water and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="726">I don't know what they used for so...for soap, quite obviously.</sentence><sentence id="727">One of the things that was uh popular in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> to use was the the ashes of charcoal.</sentence><sentence id="728">It's fantastic to clean your clothes with.</sentence><sentence id="729">I don't know how fantastic, but that was one of the additives to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span>, to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="730">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span> consisted of a uh uh tin cylindric uh bucket I guess you could call it, tall, fairly tall bucket with a little kind of a uh tube!</sentence><sentence id="731">in the middle into which you put charcoal and you lit the charcoal and that would warm up the water.</sentence><sentence id="732">Now if you were not carefull enough and you had your laundry touch that part of the kettlel, uh you could even get it burned.</sentence><sentence id="733">At any rate, it would be boiled in there, and then it would be put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, scrubbed with a brush, and of course rinsed.</sentence><sentence id="734">Now my job in all of this was to pull water from the uh <span class="DLF">well</span>.</sentence><sentence id="735">We had a little <span class="DLF">well</span> in the uh in our, in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but that was the drinking water and the washing water and every other kind of water,</sentence><sentence id="737">1 and uh if it was towards the summer and in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> it doesn't rain like in in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> you only have a rain period, uh the water very quickly gets exhausted and ( ) bottom of your <span class="DLF">well</span> and then you have to wait for several hours to start filling up again.</sentence><sentence id="738">At any rate I, that was my job - to fill up buckets and buckets of water uh for the laundry, for washing and for drying the laundry.</sentence><sentence id="739">And of course then the laundry was hung in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> and my mother would iron, and again, ironing was done with a steam iron, but a big heavy uh iron iron, which opened up and you put burning charcoal into it in order to heat it.</sentence><sentence id="740">How do you iron without heat?</sentence><sentence id="741">All of these things today are laughable but they weren't so laughable then.</sentence><sentence id="742">They were pretty serious.</sentence><sentence id="743">It was a living for us for a good number of years, at least two, two, two and a half years and uh my parents continued doing this sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="744">What did I do in all of this time?</sentence><sentence id="745">My dog was with me for sure.</sentence><sentence id="746">Out in the on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, this only danger really was uh snake bites and that was not so far-fetched and it was also dangerous for us.</sentence><sentence id="747">In fact my mother once found a snake in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> when she went at night to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="748">Uh the uh thing that I I had a carefree life in the sense that schooling as such for a while I didn't attend.</sentence><sentence id="749">Again, all through the uh month or however long we were in the two uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the center of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, in and , other immigrants were teaching me.</sentence><sentence id="750">I did a great deal of reading and I today speak, read, and write a perfect German and it's only due to the efforts of all these lovely people and my own tremendous hunger for reading.</sentence><sentence id="751">I read a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="752">Whatever came into my hand, be it Italian or be it German, I read it.</sentence><sentence id="753">And this was really the basis of my uh education until I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the age of 15.</sentence><sentence id="754">Uh my parents however they did it is still is a uh miracle and uh a puzzle to me, but they kept me uh fairly hap...uh happy and well-adjusted child.</sentence><sentence id="755">I can't say that I uh was not well-adjusted and I cannot say that I had a terrible childhood.</sentence><sentence id="756">The dangers perhaps I didn't understand that well.</sentence><sentence id="757">Uh for a part of our life in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> we were more or less safe and and secure.</sentence><sentence id="758">Uh the uh lack of uh material values wasn't that something that mattered to me as a child so much.</sentence><sentence id="759">We lived out on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">That was fun.</sentence><sentence id="761">There was a cow.</sentence><sentence id="762">I learned to milk.</sentence><sentence id="763">I had some chickens.</sentence><sentence id="764">Uh I collected their eggs.</sentence><sentence id="765">Uh eventually my mother found out that there was an afternoon Italian school taught by nuns.</sentence><sentence id="766">She registered me and she took me there uh and I started learning how to read and write Italian.</sentence><sentence id="767">Uh the following school year I was actually registered into the third grade - I had gone in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> just to the first grade and a few month,s into the second grade.</sentence><sentence id="768">They took me into the third grade.</sentence><sentence id="769">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was taught by nuns.</sentence><sentence id="770">It is always my favorite thing to say that I was taught by uh I was taught in a <span class="BUILDING">nunnery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="771">Uh nuns did teach me, and they were lovely.</sentence><sentence id="772">They were very good to me.</sentence><sentence id="773">They knew I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="774">There were some kids in the class as well, but for one year, one school year, I really lived a normal, uh student life.</sentence><sentence id="775">I went in the morning to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="776">Uh we had to dress in uniforms like all Italian children.</sentence><sentence id="777">A black smock with a white collar and a blue big bow.</sentence><sentence id="778">Uh the nuns were good to me.</sentence><sentence id="779">They were not pressuring unduly let's say honestly.</sentence><sentence id="780">Nuns do not walk by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="781">They're always accompanied by someone, and so at times I would accompany my favorite nun from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to her uh domicile which was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span>.</sentence><sentence id="782">She would ask me to come to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with me, to take her to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="783">Uh she would occassionally say, why, why don't you kneel down and pray with me.</sentence><sentence id="784">Nothing will happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="785">And besides, why do you people suffer so much.</sentence><sentence id="786">You really could save your suffering.</sentence><sentence id="787">But that was the most that I ever experienced in uh uh the sense of being pressured into uh accepting or believing in Catholicism.</sentence><sentence id="788">I have to honestly say they never pressured us.</sentence><sentence id="789">They never, no one every talked about baptism or anything of that sort at all.</sentence><sentence id="790">So for one year, as I said, I had a very normal childhood.</sentence><sentence id="791">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the</sentence><sentence id="793">2 morning, and I loved it.</sentence><sentence id="794">I loved it so much that in the morning when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I regreted the fact that another day was going by, and it was one less day of going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> till the vacation came.</sentence><sentence id="795">And this was the only year - this is the year 1942-43.</sentence><sentence id="796">Uh ( ) we had also uh made friends with an Albanian family.</sentence><sentence id="797">Uh their name is .</sentence><sentence id="798">He was a construction or a civil engineer.</sentence><sentence id="799">She was German, and they had two sons.</sentence><sentence id="800">Uh most Albanians who study anything - there was no <span class="BUILDING">university</span> uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> - uh Ivan studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, perhaps he even went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="801">I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="802">But this was the norm.</sentence><sentence id="803">Anybody who uh had a profession had been to study abroad.</sentence><sentence id="804">And uh this particular engineer had studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and met and married a German woman, who I assume had had adapted uh herself to the religion - I don't know what the procedure of becoming a Moslem woman is or not, but she certainly brought up her children in the Moslem faith.</sentence><sentence id="805">Uh interesting individual and uh I'd like to dwell on her for a moment only because it is such a very typical story.</sentence><sentence id="806">We were her so-called court Jews.</sentence><sentence id="807">She was such a strong supporter of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="808">In her <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> she had a tremendous colored portrait of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="809">Her, she came from which is the beginning, which was the beginning of Hitler's little band of supporters.</sentence><sentence id="810">She enjoyed telling us of the fact that uh in the late twenties and early thirties when national socialism was still illegal in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, during the Republic, uh secret meetings with Hitler took place in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of her father's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and you cannot, she would tell me mother, the charisma of this man, these eyes - I mean and she would really go into all kinds of esctasy describing this ( ) phenomenal human being that this Hitler was and so on.</sentence><sentence id="811">But she was Albanian and she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, I mean in in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, and she was a a good woman.</sentence><sentence id="812">She would come out to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where we lived and bring us food, and uh when the chips were down, that is to say in 1943 when uh, well I don't have to repeat the history which is already known, but eventually the Germans regarded the Italians as their enemies and they actually occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, and uh to the extent where they deported the Italians by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, via back into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="813">And they became the rulers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albsnia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="814">Uh at this point, it became very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="815">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> - oh, I have really skipped something that is most important, and where the family came in very much.</sentence><sentence id="816">Uh a little bit earlier on, I suppose it must have been - well, let's go back.</sentence><sentence id="817">I I'm afraid we have to go back to 1942.</sentence><sentence id="818">In 1942, first of all the Germans are occupying <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, and a group of maybe approximately a hundred Yugoslave Jews accomp...came across the <span class="DLF">border</span> at , and the Albanians let them in.</sentence><sentence id="819">Uh here the Italians are still the rulers of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, together with the Albanians, and these!</sentence><sentence id="820">Jews are escaping uh and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span>.</sentence><sentence id="821">Uh the Germans had bombarded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> for twenty-four solid hours, at the end of which they marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and some of these Jews were able to escape really literally escape by the <span class="DLF">back door</span> when the Germans already entered the <span class="DLF">front door</span>, and uh made their way to the uh <span class="DLF">Albanian border</span> and came across.</sentence><sentence id="822">And uh there were there were about a hundred of them.</sentence><sentence id="823">Eventually we met them.</sentence><sentence id="824">We are now in 1942, and even another interesting uh point that I didn't uh mention I'll briefly mention it, in this little uh <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived on the <span class="DLF">farm</span>, an Italian family eventually moved in.</sentence><sentence id="825">Our friends the Mundles, left the laundry, quote, unquote - did something else with, for a living, for a livelihood.</sentence><sentence id="826">And an Italian family moved in.</sentence><sentence id="827">He was a truck driver, and uh he rented the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> while his wife was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> giving birth to their first child.</sentence><sentence id="828">And uh she would be coming within a month's time with this baby, and indeed, this child was born, Elsa (ph) is her name, was born on the 13th of February, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="829">why do I know this date?</sentence><sentence id="830">Because that night, some Italian soldiers tried to break into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="831">Upstairs nobody lived.</sentence><sentence id="832">Our neighbors,</sentence><sentence id="834">3 the the farmer who was living in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, didn't hear us and uh we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of course, and it was a Friday night and suddenly we realized that the <span class="DLF">window</span> was being opened from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="835">And our little dog, Picholo, jumped through the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and he was the saving grace.</sentence><sentence id="836">Italians are very frightened of dog bites because of course rabies in those days was quite prevalent and was not being controlled.</sentence><sentence id="837">And uh if they would be bitten by a dog they would have had to report to their uh health authorities and where did you get the bite.</sentence><sentence id="838">Well, they let the <span class="DLF">window</span> fall down, and ran away, and we didn't hear from them, but again, this was the most frightening experience and uh the dog barked half the night.</sentence><sentence id="839">Never came back until the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="840">And really saved our life!</sentence><sentence id="841">There's no two ways about it.</sentence><sentence id="842">These two soldiers, and they were from the , the ones with the feathered hats uh and they came with that uniform on.</sentence><sentence id="843">I mean they were out to get some money obviously.</sentence><sentence id="844">But you never know what else they came out uh they were out for, and uh we reported them the next morning.</sentence><sentence id="845">That whole night we stayed up and uh we set and it was a very bad experience.</sentence><sentence id="846">And uh the next morning we informed the uh nearby, it was nearby, an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian army camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="847">The officer was informed.</sentence><sentence id="848">They came.</sentence><sentence id="849">They investigated.</sentence><sentence id="850">They asked us to come.</sentence><sentence id="851">They had the entire batallion or however many soldiers there were, uh stand at attention and asked us to identify.</sentence><sentence id="852">Uh my parents decided not to identify, even if they had the slightest doubt that this soldier or that soldier was the person.</sentence><sentence id="853">Is impossible at night to have recognized them.</sentence><sentence id="854">Uh they you know involve themselves into such a trap, and they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="855">We never were uh bothered again, but it never never was a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> again for us.</sentence><sentence id="856">Uh we lived as I said about a mile and a half or two miles away from the <span class="DLF">beach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="857">We had to go out at night.</sentence><sentence id="858">We had to uh deliver the laundry, or things of this sort.</sentence><sentence id="859">We always had the dog with us, as little as she was, but our uh landlord did two things.</sentence><sentence id="860">One, he had a big German Shepherd dog who that night was away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they never fed the dog and the dog all night long used to roam around finding food, but from here on in, he put the dog on a uh uh wire that ran around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh fed the dog well.</sentence><sentence id="861">And the other thing was he made a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in our, between our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and his so that in case something like this would happen again, we would have an escape route.</sentence><sentence id="862">We had to escape otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="863">Well, be that said.</sentence><sentence id="864">Meanwhile the Italian family moved in, and their name is .</sentence><sentence id="865">Last winter we were in (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) OK.</sentence><sentence id="866">So uh it's the uh fall of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="867">Uh we went, we heard that the Greek, not Greek, the Yugoslave immigrants who had come across the <span class="DLF">border</span> were now mostly living in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> called .</sentence><sentence id="868">And we were looking ( ).</sentence><sentence id="869">You have to realize that all these years went by and we really never had a.

now I have to add, this is true - my father did not typically look Jewish, whatever this may mean, and I'm saying this with tongue in cheek because I really don't believe in this uh kind of thing, but yet he wa...had a very light complexion, uh more or less the kind of uh upturned nose like I do, and he didn't, he he looked quite German.</sentence><sentence id="955">Uh and the...he probably wore one of those berets, and uh leather boots.</sentence><sentence id="956">They had seen him in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they were absolutely petrified.</sentence><sentence id="957">They thought ah-ha, there is a uh Fifth (ph) Column person trying to find Jews, and they actually went in hiding for the duration of his stay.</sentence><sentence id="958">He found this out only many many months later. ( )</sentence><sentence id="959">to as well and then met my father one day and told him this story, so he could have passed.</sentence><sentence id="960">You know a human contact so much for that but he almost became blind because of psychological stress.</sentence><sentence id="961">He could not take this any longer, and uh decided he's going to come back to <span

lived for all this time with this family.</sentence><sentence id="964">Our <span class="NPIP">place</span> out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, we still had our things there, but we were kind of afraid to go there because a small German group of soldiers had sort of set up a camp nearby.</sentence><sentence id="965">In fact this was really the</sentence><sentence id="967">6 way we saw one morning German soldiers in the <span class="DLF">field</span> with machine guns.</sentence><sentence id="968">And uh so everybady knew we were Jewish and after my father came back END OF TAPE ..continental waters of the <span class="REGION">Indian Ocean</span>, you know, what do you call it, uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Albanian waters</span> and then hopefully get their motors to work

Many Albanians have gone underground, young people have gone underground, have joined the Partisans.</sentence><sentence id="977"><span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had its own partisan group under

id="979">Uh but mountaneous areas were completely infested by uh Partisans.</sentence><sentence id="980">And uh here also uh throughout the years, uh the Italian con...uh truck drivers had a very hard time.</sentence><sentence id="981">Their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> were usually attacked and emptied out and so on.</sentence><sentence id="982">I mean this was how they made their

facilities.</sentence><sentence id="997">An <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> in the back of it, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="998">So uh it was maybe seven, eight o'clock in the morning, I'm not sure, and my mother was sweeping the <span class="DLF">front steps</span> when out of no where a German officer with a few soldiers appeared and said, uh , I have been looking for you for several days already and I never find you at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="999">And my mother had the presence of mind to lock the <span class="DLF">door</span> of my father, of my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> - he was upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="1000">He was luckily still in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, just getting up - she locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1001">And took the key out.</sentence><sentence id="1002">And uh he proceeded to tell her that two days ago, exactly when it was Yom Kippur and we chose to walk the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, he had came to look for us.</sentence><sentence id="1003">He had heard that we were such a uh charming German family and uh we were uh, we would be hospitable he was sure, and uh so on and so forth, and he went on and on and on, and he's so happy that he finally met us.</sentence><sentence id="1004">And where is , so my mother told him that he had gone into to look for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because it's you know, uh everybody had</sentence><sentence id="1006">7 to evacuate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> by December and uh or November or whatever the month was, and uh my father was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1007">Instead he was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1008">This is a wooden <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, every move that you make you could hear.</sentence><sentence id="1009">Under my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was a suitcase filled with his prayer books, his , and he he just did not dare, really didn't dare move a little.</sentence><sentence id="1010">Uh he told us that his soldiers were combing the <span class="DLF">beach</span> for communists, for Partisans, and if my mother didn't care too much, wouldn't mind too much, he would like to make this his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the day.</sentence><sentence id="1011">This officer really and truly stayed the entire day with us.</sentence><sentence id="1012">My mother kept brewing coffee and bring whatever refreshments she could think of, never went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1013">Somehow this never realized that we didn't go to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1014">My father sat on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, maybe six or eight hours that day.</sentence><sentence id="1015">And uh they took me for a walk down the <span class="DLF">beach</span> towards afternoon and uh wanted to take a picture with this .</sentence><sentence id="1016">I wore two long braids, wanted to take a picture of this very typical Germanic looking girl, and uh took a picture of me and also had to show off and threw a grenade into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and show ne how the fish were all dying and and foating up to the surface, and uh finally, finally at dusk, really departed from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1017">And promised that in a few days they would come and visit again and he was so interested in my father, that's all.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Well, uh fortunately we had really found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in and together with uh three other Italian truck drivers who by now really were more or less uh without work because once the Germans took over they hardly used these Italian truck drivers anymore, and they were also by now enemies of the regime and they really didn't know what they were going to do or whether they were going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or would stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> or what they should be doing.</sentence><sentence id="1019">At any rate, we were very good friends with one particular uh individual, uh was his name. ,</sentence><sentence id="1020">and uh two of his nephews I believe and together we took a uh <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of sorts in.</sentence><sentence id="1021">My mother would cook and uh in exchange I think they paid far the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> uh, you know, for the rent.</sentence><sentence id="1022">And uh here now really the worst of our stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> started.</sentence><sentence id="1023">The Germans were completely in uh control of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1024">As typical as always they uh uh put in, they never did their own dirty work.</sentence><sentence id="1025">They always would create a local SS group of uh you know natives who would do their dirty work, as in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> they had the Iron Guard and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> whatever they called them.</sentence><sentence id="1026">Here they called them the Ballistas (ph), a group of uh rough-necks really who decided to you know go on the <span class="REGION">German side</span>, Albanians uh who harrassed the Italians something awful, mostly for money.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And I remember that uh all of these uh friends of ours, these Italians, had uh uh you know, sold their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> by now because there was no more need for them, and what were they going to do for, with the with the money, and my mother was the chief uh monley uh <span class="DLF">belt sewer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1028">You know, they carried their money on the bodies in a belt kind of thing.</sentence><sentence id="1029">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1030">Uh but these Ballistas would come in the middle of the night and search their uh <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1031">they didn't come to us .</sentence><sentence id="1032">It became exceedingly exceedingly dangerous and exceedingly uh uncomfortable is uh is an understatement of the word.</sentence><sentence id="1033">Uh these Ballistas, would come in the middle of the night always.</sentence><sentence id="1034">I mean this is this is their method, this is the way of doing it.</sentence><sentence id="1035">You always create much more terror and fear in people at night.</sentence><sentence id="1036">Uh they would you know in in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> the the the uh <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were surrounded by high <span class="DLF">walls</span> and you have like a <span class="DLF">portal</span>, a big <span class="DLF">portal</span> that you close at night.</sentence><sentence id="1037">But they would come and and bang against these these <span class="DLF">portals</span> you know, and you have to open them from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and then they would proceed searching for money and for things and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1038">At any rate, uh by the winter of of uh of "43 or "44, by the winter of "44, all of these Italians who had evacuated by the Germans, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, they drove them through the whole Balkan (ph) and</sentence><sentence id="1040">8 into and back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1041">Uh I started saying something to you before that this family , I visited last year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> after 46 years and got the tale end of the story because I never knew how he got to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1042">And he told me the whole story uh how he was taken by the Germans and how they were treated, like new enemies.</sentence><sentence id="1043">At any rate uh uh the these people who, with whom we were living were evacuated and so we also had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because it was too costly for us, and we moved to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I mean we were just moving around all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1044">Summer of 1944, maybe June, July, whatever, uh notices went up on the uh on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> or on the tele...on the whatever, electric poles or whatever, uh all foreigners had to appear at <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> at such and such a date and register.</sentence><sentence id="1045">And this was the real thing.</sentence><sentence id="1046">Uh to come back to family , we still frequented their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from time to time, but it became so uh with the German officers walking in and out of there and somehow she was naive enough to not to understand that it to us was not only uh unpleasant but very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1047">It became a point you know, why aren't you in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> doing your duty and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1048">You know, my father wasn't all that old at that point yet.</sentence><sentence id="1049">Uh we ceased going there.</sentence><sentence id="1050">We simply did not go there anymore and uh uh now of course the big started.</sentence><sentence id="1051">What are we going to do?</sentence><sentence id="1052">Now some of us, by this time all, however mamy Jews were left, we were all together in , because this was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could be.</sentence><sentence id="1053">All the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> had been mined by the Germans, and uh al... altogether it was much safer I guess to to to be in .</sentence><sentence id="1054">Uh Partisan activity at this stage of the game was extemely active.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Every night, the moment it got dark, they would come down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, do all kinds of mostly attacking German positions attacking uh uh places of German concentration of soldiers, whatever - minimg <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, <span class="DLF">mining roads</span> and so on and shooting all night long.</sentence><sentence id="1056">You would hear shooting.</sentence><sentence id="1057">There was always a curfew - the moment it got dark there was a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="1058">You could never be out at dark.</sentence><sentence id="1059">Uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, in , there were <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days every Thursday.</sentence><sentence id="1060">Every Thursday, Germans through their henchmen, would hang the number of Partisans that they had caught at night or who knows how many nights before, hang them from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> uh tops and have the entire citizenry see them, and always on <span class="BUILDING">market</span> day, because that's when most people would come, go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and would see uh you know, the results of the night.</sentence><sentence id="1061">And uh not knowing what was going on, my mother and I once uh were caught by uh you know - went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and spent and saw this and it was really horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="1062">We never thereafter walked into the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh we were registered, and when it came to name and and address and where it was and how, religion, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> went over the left hand margin and they put down Jewish, so at this point we knew for sure that we had been registered.</sentence><sentence id="1064">And uh some of our people panicked and decided to uh escape to the Partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1065">There were a few uh at least male members of the family that went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh escaped.</sentence><sentence id="1066">Uh the uh they just did not want to take a chance and uh to stay on.</sentence><sentence id="1067">Uh we had a friend.</sentence><sentence id="1068">In fact, he was a cousin to this , and he had been a liaison officer between the Albanian government and the German officers, the German whatever uh general who was ruling over <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span>, and he knew exactly what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1069">He also knew of what we had heard that the Germans indeed had asked for the list of the Jews we don't know any Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1070">We only know Albanians.</sentence><sentence id="1071">And with that, the result of that was they naw had to proceed and register us themselves, and that of course caused a tremendous delay which was in our favor.</sentence><sentence id="1072">Well, this person had made arrangements with us that when the time came, and he hoped or he was sure that he would know when they would actually deport us, he would send a peasant to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and take us behind the uh <span class="DLF">Partisan lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1073">It was perhaps a tremendous chance to take.</sentence><sentence id="1074">On the other hand</sentence><sentence id="1076">9 I don't, we knew by this time that the conditions in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> were such that for a woman and a child to survive were almost nil.</sentence><sentence id="1077">Uh food they didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="1078">Uh health conditions of Partisans was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1079">And uh we took the chance and stayed.</sentence><sentence id="1080">And uh as I say, uh my parents had the number, I mean at this point they again had to make a living.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Uh my father started a bit in trading.</sentence><sentence id="1082">He would buy wholesale and he would sell <span class="BUILDING">retail</span> and make a few pennies along the way.</sentence><sentence id="1083">I was always left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they always went together, and of course they met often these very tricky situations with Germans uh in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and not being able to talk and uh the store keeper knowing that they knew German and asking them to be interpreters uh of course never realizing the danger that they were putting them into because what did they - they didn't, they were not anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Uh Albanians certainly were not like that.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And they didn't uh .</sentence><sentence id="1086">Eventually the uh the activity of the Partisans became so tremendous that uh one night it was so terrible that I remember actually ending up under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1087">I mean the dangers were terrible uh at this point.</sentence><sentence id="1088">To leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1089">Uh between being caught by the Germans; or being caught by snipers from the Partisans or being uh somebody recognizing you - I mean I can't even tell you at this point how I felt.</sentence><sentence id="1090">I think it was really one great uh feelinlg of fear.</sentence><sentence id="1091">Fear that my parents wouldn't come back if they were a little bit delayed.</sentence><sentence id="1092">Uh just fear of everything really.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1870">A: Uh well, the uh one night the shooting at dawn didn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="1871">That's quite simply what happened, and this was now the beginning of December 1944.</sentence><sentence id="1872">Uh we actually, it was so close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we, I mean all night long we were just lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> taking shelter under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or taking shelter under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1873">I mean it was all really nonsense, but that's what we did.</sentence><sentence id="1874">And as the rule was, that as soon as it got light <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the shooting would stop.</sentence><sentence id="1875">Well that day the shooting didn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And so we understood that something out of the ordinary had happened.</sentence><sentence id="1877">And uh sure enough uh fairly uh soon - I don't know, maybe nine, ten o'clock in the morning - there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, on the <span class="DLF">portal</span>, and uh my father took all of his courage to his hand and opened the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1878">I'm sure he expected that German soldiers would be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and were getting us finally.</sentence><sentence id="1879">Uh two Partisan soldiers stood there in their green uniforme with the red star, communist star, on their hats.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And we understood that during the night they had occupied half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of and we were the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in from the corner and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> were the Germans and on our side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> were the communists.</sentence><sentence id="1881">Well, they told us that uh they would suggest that we leave <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because we were much too close to the <span class="DLF">line</span> and they didn't know what would happen.</sentence><sentence id="1882">We should quickly take a uh few belongings and go up the <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was a uh wellconstructed <span class="BUILDING">brick house</span> and with a shelter and we should go there and stay there for a few days till ....Well, we did and uh we found other Albanians there.</sentence><sentence id="1883">Uh none of our own pleople lived in that uh <span class="REGION">area</span> at all, so were really on our own completely there.</sentence><sentence id="1884">Uh the only other people that we knew on the <span class="DLF">street</span> other than our landlord and land lady - and our landlord wasn,"t there because simply he had escaped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1885">He was a loyalist and he knew what was happening, that the communists were taking over, so he had to escape because of that.</sentence><sentence id="1886">Uh the only other family was a German family, no, a Swiss family, and they were Christian Scientists and they had lived for m,any years.</sentence><sentence id="1887">Anyway, we spent the night there, and what they had done was literally organize in such a way that people slept in shifts, with just a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and they let people sleep a few hours and then</sentence><sentence id="1889">0 other people.</sentence><sentence id="1890">Suddenly in the middle of the night uh somebody shouted and screamed and we all went out to look what happened and half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of was ablaze.</sentence><sentence id="1891">The Germans in their retreat, and they hadn't retreated completely yet, had set the entire old <span class="BUILDING">market places</span> on fire and there was a tremendous .</sentence><sentence id="1892">Uh the next morning my parents decided that uh there was one family by the name of who all along had lived uh way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1893">Way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, quite near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, uh the beginning of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> I think.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And uh so they decided to leave this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to uh to go there with me, and we really made it in a few hours walking time we made it there.</sentence><sentence id="1895">Uh many times uh had to lie down or take shelter of some way or other because the shooting was going on, and uh we finally got there and of course they said that we could stay there.</sentence><sentence id="1896">And they left me there and they took my, and my two parents, my parents decided they better go back and take a few belongings, and some clothes and some things, valuable things.</sentence><sentence id="1897">Valuable things, whatever there was out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and then come back and stay.</sentence><sentence id="1898">Who knows how long the war will take.</sentence><sentence id="1899">Well, they did make it back, and they may, and they did take some suitcase or two and put some belongings in there.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And on the way back, indeed they were caught by cross-fire and uh my father shouted to my mother, in German, to take shelter, to lie down flat on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1901">And a Partisan girl, soldier girl, heard them in German and of course thought that she had red-handed caught two German spies.</sentence><sentence id="1902">She marched them into the nearest uh <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of the uh <span class="BUILDING">Partisan police station</span> or whatever, and uh it was a very close call again, because as they walked in they took uh uh an Albanian out.</sentence><sentence id="1903">He was shot right <span class="NPIP">outside</span> this uh <span class="BUILDING">compound</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1904">Uh God was good to them once again, and uh one of the uh officers inside this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, inside this <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, recognized my parents from when we were interned in .</sentence><sentence id="1905">He gave them the typical Albanian hug and kiss, and told one of the soldiers to accompany them to where we were staying and warned them not to leave until the end of this.</sentence><sentence id="1906">That once he could help them, but who knows what would happen the second time.</sentence><sentence id="1907">Well, this war between uh the Partisans and the German soldiers lasted for eighteen days.</sentence><sentence id="1908">Uh they needed the <span class="DLF">route</span>, to keep an open <span class="DLF">route</span> to extract their soldiers, and they kept it open for eighteen days, and then one day we saw one single solitary <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British airplane</span> that bombed the <span class="DLF">escape route</span> for a few hours, and at the end of it all when it was really over, some of the Germans soldiers by this time had deserted, were in hiding -
