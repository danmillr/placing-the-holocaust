<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I'd like you to start off by telling me your name, date of birth, place of birth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: My name is Harold Zissman, although it is not my birth name.</sentence><sentence id="6">My birth name was Zuckerman, same Harold.</sentence><sentence id="7">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Austrofmazotyetski</span> (ph) and that was about a hundred kilometers east from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="8">My parents and grandparents and many generations before them were of the Hasidic belief.</sentence><sentence id="9">However, they were involved in business from crockery, porcelain, glassware, and they used to distribute it to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in the vicinity and in further away places, maybe 200 kilometers to 300 kilometers from base.</sentence><sentence id="10">It was a divided <span class="REGION">territory</span> that they shared among the other and it was their <span class="REGION">territory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">They would supply to the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">My father, like my uncle, like his son, all were part of the operation who used to, by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, deliver goods to the various clients each week.</sentence><sentence id="13">And this was the means of making a living.</sentence><sentence id="14">It was three generations involved in it -- my grandfather, his children, which that means my father's brothers and sister, my uncle which it was, again, part of the family.</sentence><sentence id="15">So, it was a family owned and operated, a closed corporation that all these families lived out of this business.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="27">Q: Just for the record, I don't think you told what your date of birth is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: My date of birth is 19, ah, May 10, 1922.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Well, my personal life was brought up a real strict, devote Hasidic kind of way.</sentence><sentence id="34">Besides all of that, my father was a Corporal in the Polish Army, during World War IJ, and life was strictly on a military basis, with the command, you had to do that, you were told to do it.</sentence><sentence id="35">If you didn't do it, you had to report.</sentence><sentence id="36">So, it was really a strenuous life, that it was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, especially for me since I was the oldest of four.</sentence><sentence id="37">I had two more brothers and a sister, who vanished in the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="43">Q: Did you, you went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="45">A: I graduated a tri-level school, which it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, influenced by Zionist organization, Mesrah (ph), to which my father was a member and a member of the board on top of it.</sentence><sentence id="46">Tri-level because it was Yiddish, Hebrew, and Polish; it was not just for linguistic-sake, but in history and geography and literature and so on.</sentence><sentence id="47">And later on, I graduated equal to a <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, as we talk about the modern way; the name was Dachkemone (ph).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Did you have contact with non-Jewish people as well?</sentence><sentence id="52">What was the, sort of the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: When you talk about <span class="BUILDING">scholastically</span> at the time, it was a <span class="BUILDING">sectarian school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">It was strictly boys, without girls, and it was strictly influenced by religion, so it was a boys" religion type of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>; if you wish to call it parochial, would be in place.</sentence><sentence id="55">However, from the outside world, we were living on both sides for Gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="56">So to say that I associated with Gentile boys, yes, I did, played maybe soccer with them, or just like neighbors sometimes get together.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="57">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in those days?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="60">As a kid going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it would have been sort of different as to bring it out in today's world, as we live in, in the 20th century.</sentence><sentence id="61">We used to, for instance, to give you an example, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early in the morning, carry a lantern, for instance, to go.</sentence><sentence id="62">The boys of the neighbors at that particular time, maybe would walk their dogs or stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="63">And it was nothing odd to see this dog was sent against us.</sentence><sentence id="64">Although, we were going sometimes two, three kids together, neighbors; or maybe throwing, for the sake of play, throwing a rock at us.</sentence><sentence id="65">I did not see friendliness in it.</sentence><sentence id="66">I sensed that because the words that would follow it would be sometimes easily recognizable: "dirty Jew."</sentence><sentence id="67">And the likes that kids were ready, even at that age, and I'm talking now by the age of seven, eight, nine years of age.</sentence><sentence id="68">And you probably did not, I did not get the training of hatred, but I felt my neighbors kids do what they did to us was hatred.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: How did you make sense of this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: There was no sense.</sentence><sentence id="82">You do what you've got to do.</sentence><sentence id="83">At times, sometimes maybe you throw a rock back.</sentence><sentence id="84">And that's when a fight would ensue and you'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and have to pay for it because the parents did not like for you to fight on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">So, to resist was bad; not to resist was also bad.</sentence><sentence id="86">So, it was a mix of no decision and no resolve.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="93">Q: Before 1939, what did you know about Hitler or Nazis where you lived?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: First of all, it was in our history books in 1933 when Hitler did come and became Chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="96">So we were aware historical from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">Second of all, come 1937 when Hitler drove all the Polish citizen Jews out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where they had to come back, although <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> didn't claim them, but they were Polish citizens.</sentence><sentence id="98">We were exposed to them real early because our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was about 40 kilometers from <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>; in other words, the location would be to go about 135 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kinegsburg</span> (ph) which was <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, and we were about 100 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">So, for us to see scene at that particular time was a real scene to see.</sentence><sentence id="100">The people came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they had nothing with them; all they had with them was their belongings that was on them.</sentence><sentence id="101">And I remember we would learn as a child that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> were set up for those people so they could come and have something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="102">And it was cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> for the people that somebody moved in with somebody else and so on.</sentence><sentence id="103">So the story in 1937 was not just a story that one read in the paper or one heard on the radio if, occasionally you could, because not every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> did have a radio, but you used to listen in sometimes outside near the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that did have a radio.</sentence><sentence id="104">And it looks like the people didn't mind; they were all aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="105">So it was no longer a story that was told, but it's a story that was seen.</sentence><sentence id="106">It was real; the <span class="DLF">trap</span> is there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: Do you remember your family talking about what was happening or whether there was anything for you to do, or whether it would come to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, these kind of problems?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="122">It was, a few months later, I'm talking now "37, come "38, this scene became more vivid locally.</sentence><sentence id="123">We had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">river Nalif</span> (ph) going through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">And it may sound a little funny that in 1914, during World War I, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that was occupying the <span class="REGION">area</span>, not this type of German's that they build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that was still considered new in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, crossing that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And at that particular time, the Polish Army started to start building <span class="DLF">dams</span>; in other words they wanted to flood the on-coming German Army.</sentence><sentence id="126">This is how they thought yet in their minds, that it would be.</sentence><sentence id="127">So basically, being that you were a youngster like I was at the time, that in the summertime going to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> which we used to walk and share our fun there, areas near the <span class="DLF">beach</span> became restricted because they were building the <span class="DLF">dams</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">So one could not help but see a war, sort of this kind building up.</sentence><sentence id="129">We only did not know how long it would take.</sentence><sentence id="130">So, to answer, as I just stated, we did know something tragic as war will come, but we did not know when.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Now, was there any talk of your family of trying to leave that <span class="REGION">area</span>, or at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Yes, it was a personal tragedy at my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">I lost my mother at that time and tragedy was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already.</sentence><sentence id="145">As a gesture, my mother's sister which still alive in here -- she's in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now -- and her brothers, which with they are no longer alive, tried to save me.</sentence><sentence id="146">Since she had a letter in her possession, the last letter which I have, with my mother pleading for her to save me and bring me to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">They did send me the papers and as time that I wanted to leave, I didn't make it.</sentence><sentence id="148">Hitler beat me to it.</sentence><sentence id="149">By 1939 in September, I was supposed to come for the visa, but September 1, the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="150">So, yes, as I said, we felt it and we knew it, the other tragedy.</sentence><sentence id="151">Personally at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, the size, the eminence of the other tragedy to follow, with Hitler.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="161">Q: Tell me of your memories of the war beginning, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: The preparation before the war, as I mentioned about the <span class="DLF">dam</span> and the mobilization it started already, in early "39.</sentence><sentence id="164">And at that particular time became month by month, the news became as an echo, closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, especially like ours.</sentence><sentence id="165">For instance, on <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days, before hostilities had started, we used to have an exchange of German people coming in to purchase their eggs, buy their chickens and so on, because it was an open <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was willing, we had an over abundance of food in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they were good customers so therefore, we saw all at once that not so many Germans coming to <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> did not now want to sell it to them, so before making it a total restriction, there was limitations of how much they could take out, or how much they could buy.</sentence><sentence id="166">So, one could sense a change and all of this here affected a little bit of the economy because you were built up and ready.</sentence><sentence id="167">The other <span class="NPIP">part</span>, my father would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with stories telling of sometimes inticinating (sic), stone throwing, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="168">So, on every occasion, being from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, being from for instance religious upbringing, as we used to come.</sentence><sentence id="169">I was singing in a choir at that time with one of my friends who were the cantor's children attending the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as I did.</sentence><sentence id="170">Yavnev (ph) was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, by the way for the record.</sentence><sentence id="171">And the tune of the high holiday 1938 was no longer the same as it was in "37 or prior to that.</sentence><sentence id="172">It was sort of more solemnity.</sentence><sentence id="173">So in every way of life, from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to going to the <span class="DLF">beaches</span>, one could sense a change all over.</sentence><sentence id="174">And you did not have to find out what; everyone was tuned to the news very much and the newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="175">And, in our own family, we started to prepare ourselves and my parents and grandparents remembered that in World War I, our city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranlinka</span> (ph), which I am speaking of, at the time that I was, we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranlinka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">Because prior to that, my family were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, the city of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">birthplace</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astramocietska</span> (ph) involved in the same business as I aforementioned, but they were forced, of their personal matters with one of the partner's bankruptcy, to move and they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stranlinka</span> (ph) in 1929, re-starting again only a family operation, not like before when it was multi-families.</sentence><sentence id="177">And therefore they decided, since they were remembering that in World War I, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostranlinka</span> (ph), the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally burned down by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lastrovmazofyetsky</span> (ph) not having a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> nearby, not having the main <span class="DLF">station railroads</span> remain quiet, so they decided that probably the war would not reach in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lastrovmazofyetsky</span> (ph) but it will be only in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="178">And, as a means of dividing, so they also took are merchandise from our <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and try to put it in hiding in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so in case it gets destroyed here, they'll have something to live on there and vice versa.</sentence><sentence id="179">So, yes; the family began to know before September | that world, not knowing to us that World War I was going to be named but that some war is going to break out any time, any moment.</sentence><sentence id="180">And that was what they decided to do, basically, is to divide.</sentence><sentence id="181">And closer to the war, the family, all of us, were in that city of Lastrovmazofyetsky (ph) and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> they left the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that we were living in, as sort of to the outcome it will be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: So, you all moved back before the war.</sentence><sentence id="202">When you talked about going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were you talking about?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="205">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="207">Q: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="209">A: While I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, see again, I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, looks like my parents did not know what to do with me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">So at three and a half years old I was sent to a private, to like a malamet (ph) as we say in Hebrew, which it means a tutor translated into English.</sentence><sentence id="211">And it was private.</sentence><sentence id="212">That tutor had about ten, twelve kids and it still is, I'm of age now, but it's still the picture of that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and with all the songs surrounding it, you know, with the story of a tutor still is very vivid to me to this day.</sentence><sentence id="213">So, three and a half years of age, I already was a student in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">However, it was again another story.</sentence><sentence id="215">When I reached the age of seven, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was compulsory.</sentence><sentence id="216">You had to start at 7 o'clock, at seven years old.</sentence><sentence id="217">So therefore, when I reached the age of seven, we were in a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> already, moving into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="218">At that particular time I was very advanced in my Yiddish and in my Hebrew teachings.</sentence><sentence id="219">However, Polish I could speak but I did not know enough to qualify to be in the first grade.</sentence><sentence id="220">And since it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span>, so my father would be involved paying extra money for three years for me to catch up because, according to the exams, I would qualify to go into the third grade, but I did not, they wouldn't let me be in the third grade since I did not know, had enough education in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="221">So my father hired a tutor to tutor me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in Polish only and with permission, and I was transferred into the second grade.</sentence><sentence id="222">However within the first year and the tutor, I was able to go in immediately, not even finishing the year, to third grade.</sentence><sentence id="223">So, it was rough on me even then, already, you know, as it was the rest of my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: What do you remember about the very beginning of war?</sentence><sentence id="240">Was your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> occupied?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="244">At the year that I'm talking about, to make it vivid, it falls out before the high holidays, as we call our Rosh Hashanah, the way it would be.</sentence><sentence id="245">So the day before Rosh Hashanah, while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostrovmazovetsky</span> (ph), that's when the Germans entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">That first hello from them that we had was the same very day, within hours, they occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">They started to round up Jews, in other words, coming in with their guns drawn in their hands and you they rouse, "Jew out".</sentence><sentence id="248">And we were all gathered at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> over there, where it was the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, which had a big <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="249">But, I mean the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was the <span class="DLF">playground</span> that they had.</sentence><sentence id="250">And we were made to be seated, hands over our head and the war, I cannot exactly tell you the amount, but there were a few thousand of us.</sentence><sentence id="251">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, we could see a machine gun, a big machine gun drawn.</sentence><sentence id="252">We were surrounded in <span class="DLF">lines</span> in between, with German soldiers, be they had carbines, some of them had automatic weapons.</sentence><sentence id="253">And for what reason we were there, what, known knew.</sentence><sentence id="254">But we expected the worst in the <span class="NPIP">position</span> that we were.</sentence><sentence id="255">After an hour of sitting over there, and it's already curfew time near, all of a sudden, looks like it was a command and we were told to get up and round back.</sentence><sentence id="256">As we found it out, the next day late, that Army was called to help some on the <span class="DLF">front line</span> while they were going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> at that time.</sentence><sentence id="257">In the days of the war, it was probably the fourth day of the war, and so take it, more or less, that it was September 4 at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="258">And we were driven, sort of to go back to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and shots were followed, a lot of them were killed on the way.</sentence><sentence id="259">Like, this year, my father, and as we were split up because we were not together there, and my father was running in another direction and since he was a military trained person, he knew how to go on his stomach and so on, to get out of the fire's way and he, when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, everybody was there but my father and we took it for granted for that night that probably he was killed.</sentence><sentence id="260">However, in the morning, he made his way to meet us and it was a joyful thing that my father was not killed, and he told us that story.</sentence><sentence id="261">So, yes.</sentence><sentence id="262">The first day of greeting, we found other casualties, the rabbi of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and a lot of people from the, from one type of <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, were driven with their shawls, or , as we call it, to the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we had a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">We did not have a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostravmazofyetsky</span>, but <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">At the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> there, there were lined up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German cars</span>, that they were asked to wash them with their shawls and then afterwards they were asked to go through.</sentence><sentence id="265">They did not know how to swim, so some of them drowned, you know, we knew right there.</sentence><sentence id="266">And when they came out, they were beaten.</sentence><sentence id="267">So, there were begin some casualties really known.</sentence><sentence id="268">We again found out that now, in order to, you cannot buy anything so there was <span class="DLF">lines</span> lined up near the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in order to get bread.</sentence><sentence id="269">And soon enough, the police, the local police, which it was organized with arm bands.</sentence><sentence id="270">And the Germans started to pull the Jews out of the <span class="DLF">lines</span> that the Jews cannot stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> for bakery goods, to get.</sentence><sentence id="271">So, yes.</sentence><sentence id="272">We immediately knew the expectations to a wait; that it will not get better but it

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: What happened next?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="307">A: The next thing that had happened, a local government came in there.</sentence><sentence id="308">By that particular time, it was about a week later already into the war and the following the holidays it was already , which as you know, it follows Rosh Hashana, Yom Kipper, and five days later, Sucot (ph).</sentence><sentence id="309">And the family decided to go back.</sentence><sentence id="310">We went back part, my father, I, and a few more.</sentence><sentence id="311">We were afraid to move, to touch the merchandise that was there because it would have been confiscated.</sentence><sentence id="312">However before that happened, I must not forget to tell an incident that a rumor had it that leather, shoe leather was hidden someplace because the Poles used, at that time, cooperated very easily with the Germans and the German demands were met.</sentence><sentence id="313">So if sometimes, they knew who the merchants were and who what, and they were aware that a lot of people were hiding their goods because they were afraid in case, so they couldn't find it and we, for what it's worth, that's my grandparents, both of them, my father and I were among the 10 or 12 hostages that were lined up again and they said if somebody's not going to tell them about where the shoe leather is hidden, we will be shot dead.</sentence><sentence id="314">So the first time in my life, I had the fear of being almost lined up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">Luck was with us that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> next to us, the leather was discovered and we were let to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="316">So, sort of to speak it, you were counting your blessings.</sentence><sentence id="317">So the second time that ever it happened that we were lined up, that we came out whole as far as the family, no casualties.</sentence><sentence id="318">But there were casualties already there.</sentence><sentence id="319">The chores immediately had started.</sentence><sentence id="320">The Jews had to line up on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a given <span class="NPIP">place</span> and from there cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and so on was the kind of work that we were ordered to do.</sentence><sentence id="321">And, of course, let me not forget to say it was without pay, for pay the billing was in order.</sentence><sentence id="322">And we decided at that particular time we had to have a paper that allowing us because without a paper who knows who could happen on the way?</sentence><sentence id="323">So we managed to get a paper, as refugees, that we were running, during the war to return back to our <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">And, the Germans gave, not the Germans but the local, from the <span class="REGION">local area</span> we got there.</sentence><sentence id="325">And we were on our way back.</sentence><sentence id="326">And on the way back, every time we were traveling, we were stopped by the Germans and they made us get off from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and start to look but we did not, we did not yet had anything to be heard, until we neared one <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, I think it was, maybe, I would say maybe 20 kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> lived one of our relatives and he had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">general type store</span> and we found out, because we stopped to find out what to do, we found out that they already had a small massacre of the Jews and his family was among them and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was no longer in his hands because it was confiscated.</sentence><sentence id="328">So we found out a little bit of mishap on the family right on the way there.</sentence><sentence id="329">No sooner had we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span>, back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was not robbed or anything like that; it was still there because the rest of the people in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> were there, so it was sort of like was somebody to watch it.</sentence><sentence id="330">So once we were there, again the chores started, the same as over there.</sentence><sentence id="331">My father was ordered and they put him into <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a day because he was cleaning.</sentence><sentence id="332">That was the main chores that Jews were given to do, street cleaning or any of the <span class="BUILDING">office buildings</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="333">And we noticed at that particular time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostralinka</span> that it was less of an uprise, less going on than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostravmozavensky</span>, which we found out later the reason.</sentence><sentence id="334">The Soviets were only at that particular time sharing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at the other end, one day the Soviets would come in, the other day the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="335">So we took it as an interpretation that since the Soviets were part over there, the Germans did not try to act out in the same way as they did for instance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostravmozavensky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">That was never supposed to be belonging to the Soviets so they had a more free hand.</sentence><sentence id="337">That went on for another few days while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> until one day, it was still the Jewish holidays of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soco</span> (ph), the second days, so the, it was placed notices all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that within ten hours, the Jews are to leave.</sentence><sentence id="338">Officially it said you could take all the belongings that you want.</sentence><sentence id="339">In our case, since we had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, so there were three of them so we shared it among the family and besides the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, we tried to manage to take some of our clothing and so on and to leave with that.</sentence><sentence id="340">Immediately, the same day, the Poles from farming and the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> came into the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and they were not asking, "Do you sell it?"</sentence><sentence id="341">or anything, but they took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">So our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was emptied out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> within a few hours.</sentence><sentence id="343">And there was known to stop them.</sentence><sentence id="344">We tried to open up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and maybe muster to get a few, some money out of it, of whatever it is, and no sooner we opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, a Polish person brought the Germans here.</sentence><sentence id="345">The Germans start to ask who the owners is, I was there with my uncle.</sentence><sentence id="346">As soon as we realized the questions, we took the first chance and run away from there, back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and that was the end.</sentence><sentence id="347">So in other words, that was confiscated.</sentence><sentence id="348">So however, the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> in hiding was, still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostravmozavetsky</span>, where I and a cousin of mine, in a few months, almost two months later, make a chance and cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, dressed as farmers and we make an attempt, the Germans almost caught up with us and we salvaged some merchandise from there, from the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, which it gave us an ability with, money- wise, to have for the first winter that we were over there.</sentence><sentence id="349">And it's a long story to tell until we get there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="393">Q: I have one question.</sentence><sentence id="394">I'm a little confused.</sentence><sentence id="395">These two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, were they close to each other, because you seem to go back and forth a bit?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="399">A: 40 kilometers, which, in our miles-way, we were talking about 20 miles.</sentence><sentence id="400">So you must understand, 20 miles driving with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> is nothing, but with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, it would take, with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, you know, it would take a few hours which you would be there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="403">Q: But, you seem to have the freedom to choose between these two <span class="NPIP">places</span> to go back and forth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="405">A: When do you talk about, in the first days of the war?</sentence><sentence id="406">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="407">Until we were sent out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, you needed to have a piece of paper, that in other words, you were permitted.</sentence><sentence id="408">So once you had a permit, you were stopped.</sentence><sentence id="409">They checked the permits but you could move about.</sentence><sentence id="410">Tape #2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: How long did it take before certain decrees or rules were implemented by the Germans and Poles?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="419">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="420">All the German forerunners were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="421">That's how they were, that was their infantry, starting with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and so on and armor would follow them.</sentence><sentence id="422">Immediately, their crews would post posters on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lighting poles</span> or whatsoever, wherever posters could be posted, telling the new ordinance, what it is: A.That it was curfew hours.</sentence><sentence id="423">B. That the Jews must be identified and must carry identification and in the early part, at least in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, we were supposed to wear a band with the Mark of David, with the Star of David on it.</sentence><sentence id="424">And it was told immediately if one is caught, they will be shot.</sentence><sentence id="425">That was for anything that one violates, violating the curfew was shot.</sentence><sentence id="426">It was immediately declared that Jews cannot walk on <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="427">So, the identity was the arm band and you must not walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>; you must walk just on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">And the same story was, in reading on further, one would know that Jews no longer can attend any <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, Jews can no longer own any businesses, Jews no longer have rights and that was stating according to the rules of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremborg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="429">Therefore, for the time being, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not erected as yet, that was not talked about as yet, but they always must report every morning to their assigned <span class="NPIP">places</span> for the assigned work there.</sentence><sentence id="430">So in the first days of entry, when everyone got out of their <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>, running away from the bombings, they were faced immediately with the rules and arm bands affixing and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="444">Q: Did you always follow those rules?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="447">One did not try to there because we saw the consequences how easily it was for a German to draw his pistol and even without anything, can be just target practice and there wasn't a day or anyplace, as soon as they came in, that killings were not going on.</sentence><sentence id="448">And they were not re meditated; they just a lot of times were out of laughter.</sentence><sentence id="449">And I've seen with my own eyes where a mother and her child were target practice, to shoot, to see that one bullet should kill both of them at one time.</sentence><sentence id="450">And it was not to save a bullet, but it was just that the rest of the Germans would laugh, you know what I mean, you would see a scene much rather than a murder being committed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="456">Q: What were the Poles doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="458">A: Well, the Poles at that particular time, please understand, immediately remained as, those who worked in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were left working in <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="459">Those who were formerly in the police, a lot of them escaped for fear and a lot of them were drafted to the services, so a new police force was being organized.</sentence><sentence id="460">Also they were carrying bands to identify the police.</sentence><sentence id="461">So the Poles were pretty much back to their normal lives, whatever they had to do, you know toying around with a new regime, you know.</sentence><sentence id="462">But the important thing was, as a Jew, immediately your <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> were confiscated, you know, and if you had lived 0 someplace in a nice <span class="REGION">area</span>, it was nothing to hear new that you were pushed out.</sentence><sentence id="463">But, as I said, that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lostrovmozavetsky</span>, in the first few days; but we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostravlinka</span> as I for mentioned before, things were a little bit different and not so rapidly, due to the fact that we were sharing the Soviets on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and one did not know that they may not occupy the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="464">So, therefore it was a little bit easier.</sentence><sentence id="465">So when it happened, it happened to us rapidly; ten hours and the Jews must leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="466">When we came to the <span class="DLF">borderline</span> with bayonets they went through our belongings and if like pillows, you saw feathers fly everywhere, so in other words, and if it's anything valuable, they tried, nobody dared to carry open gold or rings or anything like that, because that was confiscated on you there.</sentence><sentence id="467">So then, you would still get a few biddings and go to the <span class="DLF">borderline</span>.</sentence><sentence id="468">And there was a no-man's land shortly in that <span class="NPIP">part</span> than over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="469">In our group, the family, my grandmother, my mother's father, he spoke Russian yet because he knew to write and to read Russian.</sentence><sentence id="470">So he served at that particular time for us as the interpreter and we crossed over on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="484">Q: Now, at what point did you decide to go over on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="486">A: It was not a decision at what point.</sentence><sentence id="487">As I said, when the posters were posted that this is declared to be a city of the Third Reich, according to the Nuremburg laws, a Jew was not permitted to dwell in the Third Reich.</sentence><sentence id="488">So we were given ten hours, as I said, to move out.</sentence><sentence id="489">So, as I said, we had ten hours to leave and we had two choices to make: either to go, as we called it at that time, Congress Poland, which it means out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to any other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, or we could cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> to the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="490">The <span class="DLF">Soviet border</span> was remained open for all who wants to cross and to come there.</sentence><sentence id="491">That was the part that it helped a lot of people be saved or rather, that it saved their lives crossing like my family did.</sentence><sentence id="492">And that we went on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="500">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="501">Continue on.</sentence><sentence id="502">Where did you go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="507">We went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 36 kilometers from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lunja</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="508">And from there, about another 15 kilometers or so was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yedvobno</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="509"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yedvobno</span> translated from Polish to English would be silt;

second cousin, third cousin.</sentence><sentence id="511">And the family sort of found ways to get situated among all that family.</sentence><sentence id="512">So even if it was only one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that it was given to go in there.</sentence><sentence id="513">And immediately, we had to register with the police ask so on and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="514">And youngsters were asked to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it was September, and the school year was disrupted for a little while.</sentence><sentence id="515"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> had started.</sentence><sentence id="516">I enlisted in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that particular time, again.</sentence><sentence id="517">Since Russian was not my language, but I had to study so instead of coming in according to my education, I should have at least come into the tenth class because the Russian had a ten-year <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">I came in at the ninth with an examination because on everything I tested but Russian and I was back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and it started a new life, sort of, in a way feeling of joy, even though everything was left behind and all of a sudden we were supposed to be the proletariat.</sentence><sentence id="519">And of course, the identity that my 1 father was a businessman was a shameful thing to say, shameful enough that you could have been arrested and sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> which the bad thing for one, which like it happened to some of the family, turned out to be good wishes for later, because it since they were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, they survived the war without a lot of these problems that the rest of us had to go through, those who survived.</sentence><sentence id="520">So, at that particular time, started a new life.</sentence><sentence id="521">I, as a young person, was starting again like all young people used to get together after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the evening and it was the Russian system, which they called "Dacadumcrasne ami" (ph), which it means the house of the Red Army.</sentence><sentence id="522">And the Red Army used to supply dances, sort of in playing, and it was, you know, that was part of their propaganda, how Stalin cares for the youth and Stalin loves us.</sentence><sentence id="523">And all of a sudden, a new life had started, to listen to politicians talking and voicing opinions that we should learn the constitution of the Soviet Union and that they came to liberate us and so on.</sentence><sentence id="524">It was a new lexicon for me and many of us to indulge and I remember it was influenced on me as a young person; after all, I was only 17, going into my 18th year of life and everything coming on so fast.</sentence><sentence id="525">So, I remember when I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, starting to talk politics with my father and tell him the wrongs, the way he was doing before, without realizing, and my father told me, "Wait, son.</sentence><sentence id="526">While you're in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, you have a clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and you have food to eat.</sentence><sentence id="527">It's very nice for you to talk of it.</sentence><sentence id="528">But, when the day will come that you will have to earn your living, you will see who is wrong."</sentence><sentence id="529">Because my father, and the rest of the family, first being religious, second they were against communism or socialism to begin with and it was sort of life at a time rolled back to working with them, being <span class="BUILDING">school</span> influenced on one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and being influenced on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="530">For me, I felt good, that no longer I have to go and go attending religious upbringing and so on.</sentence><sentence id="531">So as I lot of youngsters, you choose what it's easier and better.</sentence><sentence id="532">And especially, you come at night, and you go out with all the boys and girls and it's dancing, it was sort of a different life without knowing.</sentence><sentence id="533">And you know, that was, that's blind thing that it was put up.</sentence><sentence id="534">Before long I joined even an organization called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soviehem</span> (ph); it was a sports organization so you get involved in sports and it didn't take long, when we were asked to take our passports and after then we took out the passports, things became a little bit more strict.</sentence><sentence id="535">We were restricted as we cannot live 100 kilometers from the <span class="DLF">border</span> which that city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vadlov</span> (ph) was less than a hundred kilometers, you know, to the <span class="DLF">border</span>, so therefore as refugees, we had to start moving.</sentence><sentence id="536">So the first time winter we through there, come spring, new problems had started even on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="537">Now we had to leave all this family, leave all the people that you knew and move to at least a hundred kilometers away.</sentence><sentence id="538">We choose, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galestov</span> (ph), for instance, was the big center.</sentence><sentence id="539">Big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> were forbidden for these displaced persons to live in there and we had to .</sentence><sentence id="540">That's how it happened that we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratchen</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="541">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ratchen</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that it was far enough from the <span class="DLF">borderline</span> and we were permitted.</sentence><sentence id="542">However to get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>, was again another problem over there.</sentence><sentence id="543">They were not prepared to take in this many refugees.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="582">Q: One question before you tell me more about the .</sentence><sentence id="583">Were you able to continue practicing your religion?</sentence><sentence id="584">Were you able to be a Jew under Soviet occupation?</sentence></p></dialogue>

therefore, we were doing an inhumane thing to the animal.</sentence><sentence id="640">So therefore, kosher slaughter should be forbidden.</sentence><sentence id="641">It stirred up a tremendous out pour throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because the Polish constitution of 1918, when they gained independence, and Pilsutsky (ph) at that time being the head, and since the Jews saved his life, he owed a debt to the Jews and he kept all these anti-Semites (ph) in place.</sentence><sentence id="642">He couldn't stop them altogether, but he, like a dictator, kept it undercover and control.</sentence><sentence id="643">The Jews had elective officials, even to the same as they were called the same, <span class="BUILDING">Senate</span>, <span class="BUILDING">house of Congress</span>, as you would call it, you know, and the <span class="BUILDING">Senate</span>.</sentence><sentence id="644">And the law, and it posed tremendous protest.</sentence><sentence id="645">But I blame the Jewish leadership for not coming up at that time immediately to squelch all of this here that in turn led to the officials handling black candles and they called a fast that we have to fast and punish ourselves so that God will help us, that this bad law will be change.</sentence><sentence id="646">Well, we know the outcome, that it didn't.</sentence><sentence id="647">And the hypocrisy worked on me even as a youngster.</sentence><sentence id="648">Because why?</sentence><sentence id="649">Instead of forbidding the kosher slaughter, we were given a contingency; in other words, you can kill so many so that, in its, tells the wrongs.</sentence><sentence id="650">If it is right to kill 100 pieces of cattle, why is it wrong to kill 150 or 200.</sentence><sentence id="651">So in it, one so blatantly, that anti-Semitic out burst against the Jews, even though they were constitutionally protected, that it's a part of religious ritual to do.</sentence><sentence id="652">So know, on the <span class="REGION">Soviet side</span>, all people who are before, remembered this here case and no one sort of dared to make an issue of it.</sentence><sentence id="653">However, kosher slaughter still went on in hiding, as sort of to speak that if you want a chicken to be slaughtered properly kosher, you could, there was somebody who would do it for you.</sentence><sentence id="654">But, it sort of, since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were small and the NKVD as we called it at that time, or KGB did not penetrate so much and the local people were working in the government so some how rather, it was "Hey, I don't see it."</sentence><sentence id="655">And, of course, in many instances, you paid off for all of these goodies doing it in the say way.</sentence><sentence id="656">So, religiously, again, which it was a big upheaval for people like 4 in my family at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="657">And I as a youngster, did not feel the hurt so much because I was young and foolish as the saying would be, not understanding tomorrow, you know, what it is going to bring on us later.</sentence><sentence id="658">So, as I said, I already got the taste of the coming Soviet working and being privileged to find out at that particular time, that in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span>, workmanship was by right; in other words, the bricklayer did not earn as much money, or maybe more money as the guy who was mixing the cement.</sentence><sentence id="659">So, it was not the Soviet system of socialism but it was again, capitalism.</sentence><sentence id="660">In the capitalistic system, we know there are different rates of pay, even for the same work.</sentence><sentence id="661">So, I began do get a little doubt in the system to what is going on.</sentence><sentence id="662">And that was own a year and a half on this sort of living conditions.</sentence><sentence id="663">I still was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I came back from <span class="REGION">Devon</span> (ph) back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all of this kind of life lasted, as I said; with working in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and doing all the means.</sentence><sentence id="664">And at that particular time, I used to talk to my family, why don't they try to go ahead, go move further east, but their mind was that the work cannot be a lasting one, that the war should be over and we'll be able to return back to the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we had to run away from.</sentence><sentence id="665">However, the 22nd of June, all of the dreams of yesteryears became too evil for that same day.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="744">Q: 1941?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="746">A: 1941, the 22nd of June, Hitler attacked.</sentence><sentence id="747">I don't want to have to put it in, but maybe we have to.</sentence><sentence id="748">If anyone's seen on television not so long ago, it was brought the story back to life, the way Stalin was forewarned about all the things that Hitler was going to attack but it did not want to listen to and he even went away and executed some guys, calling them propagandists and until the war broke out, he didn't want to believe that that would be the case.</sentence><sentence id="749">That's a point I want inserted because it's a true fact, the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="750">He began to see it immediately.</sentence><sentence id="751">The local population then, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> (ph), that I was, we were hiding from the bombings, when the Germans attacked and they kept saying they wished the Germans would come in already.</sentence><sentence id="752">And after us telling them we already experienced the Germans, I hope that the Russians shouldn't lose and be able, because at that particular time it was a few days the Soviets, a few days the Germans, until it was settled.</sentence><sentence id="753">Because within ten days at that particular time, it had reached almost near to be the Mensk (ph), you know, and Hitler at that particular time was the blitz , it was named, that he'll be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> within ten days.</sentence><sentence id="754">And he almost succeeded, you know, to be there.</sentence><sentence id="755">So things began to turn real fast in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="756">Again, at this time, in "41, like it happened in "39, the first thing when the Germans sent it in the Rachen, the Jews were called to meet on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the center.</sentence><sentence id="757">The center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, like in most cases in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> also, have also, you know, they call it the <span class="DLF">plaza</span> over there, what we call the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="758">So that was usually the center for the Jews to be gathered.</sentence><sentence id="759">And they drove us out over there and, again, if you want to call it a miracle be it; to me it is a miracle but it happened.</sentence><sentence id="760">While a man, a German uniform went out and spoke to us in perfect Russian and he was a, I believe a captain, if higher, spoke to us in perfect Russian and started to tell us about the new law and all of us were searched and if anybody has jewelry or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="761">So, we had a taste right away early to put it up and all of a sudden while we were there, looks like, you know, a piece 5 of artillery that it was the wrong way, hit the corner part of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and when that hit and another one followed, the Germans started it and they were being attacked now, so we were dismissed.</sentence><sentence id="762">But the machine guns were surrounding us at the time.</sentence><sentence id="763">We were not there to listen to speeches.</sentence><sentence id="764">We were there to follow through.</sentence><sentence id="765">They started to segregate all doctors needs to go to one <span class="NPIP">side</span>; you know, the right and left, if you ever heard about it, that's what, we were a part of it.</sentence><sentence id="766">To the right, to the left; no one knew whether the right <span class="DLF">line</span> is the right <span class="DLF">line</span> or it is the wrong <span class="DLF">line</span>, you know, to go.</sentence><sentence id="767">And you had no choice about it.</sentence><sentence id="768">They would go ahead and look, right, left, and every time they was said, was always with a and that saved us, that explosion from this here artillery piece and all of a sudden the Germans were starting to run around like mice and we were returned back to our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="769">Until a couple of days later, the <span class="DLF">front line</span> started to come for fuller, the Soviets, whatever was left, retreated and that was when life under the occupation with the Nazis began.</sentence><sentence id="770">A <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> (ph) was formed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="771">A <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> means actually a government -- it was not appointment.</sentence><sentence id="772">It wasn't even elected but then, we would line up.</sentence><sentence id="773">He would point the finger to one, he would go out to the right or to the other one and they would appoint about maybe ten people.</sentence><sentence id="774">Then they told them, "You are the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span>," and they said, "You are going to be the president and this is where we'll begin to have a government," and a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed.</sentence><sentence id="775">So, for the first time, a new life starts again, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>; which it meant they mapped out a few blocks of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which could house only probably a tenth or maybe less than a tenth of the population, and it was with barbed wire surrounded all the way around, with <span class="DLF">doors</span> and we had the police, the local police which they assigned to; it used to be on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="776">The Germans could always go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> to the police, but the restriction was for farmers or Gentiles to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="777">We could only go out with a "shine" as they used to say in German; in other words, a paper which was a permit and groups used to be started in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="778">We would line up near the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span>; these ones are going, those are the carpenters.</sentence><sentence id="779">They're going to do carpentry work.</sentence><sentence id="780">Those are the electricians, going for electrical work.</sentence><sentence id="781">The other ones we'll send to cleaning the various types of <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> or the <span class="DLF">streets</span> or whatever ensued later, like it was winter for instance, to go to clean the snow.</sentence><sentence id="782">6 Tape #3 A. ... arithmetic of the case, since Jews were only 10 percent of the population, how come so much anti-Semitism could reach. (</sentence><sentence id="783">Another speaker, unintelligible.)</sentence><sentence id="784"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amoshik</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="785">So it could not be right. (</sentence><sentence id="786">Another speaker; "They wouldn't have to kill anybody.")</sentence><sentence id="787">It means the three half million people, all turned onto families.</sentence><sentence id="788">The families, let's say make it 3 or 4 per family, so it would be a fourth of that would have been.</sentence><sentence id="789">So they should have been. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="835">Q: I think you were talking about (unintelligible)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="837">A: Life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> (ph) on the occupation and with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> (ph) in full swing, brought new problems and killings day by day.</sentence><sentence id="838">They were not killings because they were called for, but it was the criteria I have aforementioned.</sentence><sentence id="839">If a policeman wanted to have fun, he killed a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="840">Or, when he was working something and if he did not work as fast as the policeman told him to do, that was a good way to basically not shoot him, but beat him to death.</sentence><sentence id="841">So everyday used to go on in the same.</sentence><sentence id="842">I had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with me a brother to my father who he was, in part, responsible for helping me with my religious education and he was a graduated rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="843">We still used to, by his demands, when I would come from work and we used to sort of talk about the Torrah, a little bit here and then the other.</sentence><sentence id="844">All of that was very distasteful at the time to me, but I loved him enough to listen to him.</sentence><sentence id="845">He's the man at that particular time came to me since maybe I didn't mention, and Luse that word, "ota defid" (ph), you know what I'm referring to?</sentence><sentence id="846">That's a French saying for "burning" and that was sort of burning on display.</sentence><sentence id="847">All religious scripture, be the Torrah, be books and everything, were ordered by the Germans to be making in a bonfire which they had burned it.</sentence><sentence id="848">They were so scared for knowledge that people could be aware that this was, again, a part of showing to the Jew which it belonged to a part of the de- humanization program.</sentence><sentence id="849">Because, you must remember that we went through certain stages.</sentence><sentence id="850">As I have aforementioned before, the laws of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> were the first laws to give them the guide.</sentence><sentence id="851">And in these laws, a Jew was not a human.</sentence><sentence id="852">A Jew loss all his rights and therefore he was a person without rights.</sentence><sentence id="853">So, the same as I have aforementioned before, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started, it was the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="854">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, a Jew could walk every <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="855">But even by marching to work or doing your chores that you were ordered to do, the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> was forbidden for a Jew to walk on.</sentence><sentence id="856">So,....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="877">Q: You mean <span class="NPIP">outside</span>? ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="879">A: Outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">Even while you were doing your duty.</sentence><sentence id="881">The only time he could walk out was when he had a broom in his hand and sweeping the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> so therefore.</sentence><sentence id="882">But otherwise, this was forbidden for Jews to walk on those <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="883">Every time you saw a German, a Jew was asked that he must salute him and say "Good morning" and so on.</sentence><sentence id="884">If you didn't, that was good enough cause for the Germans to beat you, kill you, or whatever it is because we had no rights, so he did not have to bring in front of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="885">You were executed on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="886">Quite often when the killings went on, I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and talk to my uncle and say, "Look, I'm very despondent today.</sentence><sentence id="887">7 I've seen a child being molested and killed."</sentence><sentence id="888">Or, "I've seen another instance where that happened."</sentence><sentence id="889">And basically, that was, then the <span class="DLF">dig</span>.</sentence><sentence id="890">They started to do a dig at that particular time in the out skirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="891">A <span class="DLF">pit</span> big enough for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, mind you, to go around and turn.</sentence><sentence id="892">And that ultimately was supposed to be the burial places that was intended for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but it did not happen that way because of the Protestants in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, which I'm going to get to it a little bit later, when we get to talk about the Protestants.</sentence><sentence id="893">But, right now, I'm only trying to touch base with life and what went on, the kind.</sentence><sentence id="894">Let's say when the winter came, a lot of Jews were killed and lost by sending them to go ahead to clean the snow.</sentence><sentence id="895">And they did not have the proper equipment.</sentence><sentence id="896">The Germans didn't provide shovels, it was our job that we, the Univad (ph) of the Jews had to have shovels.</sentence><sentence id="897">And to get tools at that time, it wasn't like you go into a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy it.</sentence><sentence id="898">You paid dearly through the local population to get it for you because Jews could not travel around and go to purchase things.</sentence><sentence id="899">So, in order to purchase things, that's what you had to do, the outside connection.</sentence><sentence id="900">Another thing which I do not want to leave out: the creation of the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span>, a new thing and a new word began to make its <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="901">The word was called "contribution" .</sentence><sentence id="902">Now, in the normal language when we use a contribution in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> United States, we talk about a donation.</sentence><sentence id="903">You contribute something to a welfare, to a cause.</sentence><sentence id="904">That word "contribution" was done exactly opposite; that was a punishment.</sentence><sentence id="905">In other words, it means the <span class="BUILDING">Univad</span> could be called and was beat up to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the Gestapo and they were given an order that within, for instance, ten hours for so, this community, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is to write one kilogram of gold.</sentence><sentence id="906">They did not care whether you had the gold, but if you didn't have the gold, they wanted a kilogram of gold.</sentence><sentence id="907">Maybe they were successful to bring 14 ounces; they accepted the 14 ounces, and but on another contribution, which in other words.</sentence><sentence id="908">So, little by little, all the laws began to be of that nature.</sentence><sentence id="909">Jews cannot wear leather shoes.</sentence><sentence id="910">Jews cannot wear any leather clothing.</sentence><sentence id="911">So, in other words, all of this type; if you had boots or you had shoes with leather, you had to turn that in.</sentence><sentence id="912">So all of this here was the part of the dehumanization program and the part of breaking us morally and shy away how to resist the enemy, you know.</sentence><sentence id="913">So you haven't got this and you haven't got that and you can't get the others and before long, and we used to have to come every morning and stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> to receive the amount of ounces of bread prescribed.</sentence><sentence id="914">In other words, it wasn't a matter that you go out to buy, but it was a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and the Jews used to be delivered bread and the bread was not made of flour.</sentence><sentence id="915">If you heard stories that were, you know, putting in sanding from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span>, you know, things like this.</sentence><sentence id="916">It was true.</sentence><sentence id="917">It was like that.</sentence><sentence id="918">And that the Jews had to pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="919">Labor, you didn't get paid.</sentence><sentence id="920">So you used to go through all of this here, stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> to get the ration for the day of bread.</sentence><sentence id="921">So food became a problem, and talking about smuggling was again an issue.</sentence><sentence id="922">Since my brother used to know the farmers, that he used to speculate before with the Russians, now he used to, as a child it was easier; he was four years younger than I was, so we split up at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="923">I was with the family of my father's and my brother, my two brothers and my sister went to live together with my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="924">My grandfather on the father's side was dead;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1865">A: As L aforementioned, to relocate my story right now, my rest of the guys, two men and one young lady, were getting to the point where we are to meet.</sentence><sentence id="1866">I met with them and I said, "Now, it's a little bit too light yet.</sentence><sentence id="1867">I did not want anyone to see that we are going to have to dig our way out underneath the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1868">So we must wait until dusk comes, a little bit darker."</sentence><sentence id="1869">And I know people were not on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in those days, in other words.</sentence><sentence id="1870">But still and though for the if and I wanted to dig out my bayonet from underneath there for that.</sentence><sentence id="1871">So I waited until it turned a little bit darker and we started with our bare hands.</sentence><sentence id="1872">We did not have no shovel; with our bare hands to dig a <span class="DLF">path</span> underneath because it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, that's on the other end, and it was the time of year when it wasn't frozen.</sentence><sentence id="1873">And we made a dig over there so that we were able to lift up the <span class="DLF">wire</span> and one by one, we slid on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, pushed back the sand to demarcation, so it should not be a mark seen that someone was doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1874">And, we immediately went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I said I had put my bayonet in there.</sentence><sentence id="1875">And I had a part of a piece of grass over there that I knew once I pulled it out, I wouldn't have to dig because I wanted to be on the ready with it.</sentence><sentence id="1876">I got my bayonet, put on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> "and everybody held whatever they had with them.</sentence><sentence id="1877">That's all we had, was coats.</sentence><sentence id="1878">We didn't have anything else.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And we started on our way.</sentence><sentence id="1880">I knew my directions and I therefore, at this time I'm explaining it to them.</sentence><sentence id="1881">I says, "Look straight ahead and you'll see from a distance the lights.</sentence><sentence id="1882">That's where the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="1883">We cannot go this way straight because we may run up on police or Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1884">So, what we will have to do is go out of way until we cross the main <span class="DLF">road</span> leading from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zulva</span> (ph) to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonya</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1885">That was the main <span class="DLF">artery road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1886">Once we crossed the <span class="DLF">road</span>, we have to go to the other <span class="NPIP">position</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1887">So, I explained to them that that's going to be, and I explain to them that that's going to be, and I tell them, "We are not going to go like a column, but we're going to be spread out."</sentence><sentence id="1888">So, the four of us, in case someone sees, you know, should not be able with one shoot to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1889">So, we will keep distance, distant enough.</sentence><sentence id="1890">We will not talk loud at all.</sentence><sentence id="1891">If you have to say something to somebody, come over, make a marker to stop and we'll talk because we definitely do not want anyone to hear.</sentence><sentence id="1892">The language that 2 we will talk will be Russian and, in part, we will talk Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1893">So, that if somebody should hear us, should hear any of the two languages; but definitely, by all needs, no Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="1894">To camouflage our <span class="NPIP">whereabouts</span> and who we are.</sentence><sentence id="1895">We came, as I showed it to the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we started to check and in the same spread out wing, we ran through the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1896">It was not a big <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1897">We ran through the <span class="DLF">road</span>, away from the <span class="DLF">road</span>, inland, which it was like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shrubs</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1898">And we turned, as I say, and I knew exactly the locations where it was going on by this particular time.</sentence><sentence id="1899">We had to turn a little bit forward ahead because we were getting to be closer to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, that little <span class="REGION">forest area</span>, they were making a big dig which I said.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And be that it is at night, I still was afraid who knows whether police or Germans, you know what I mean, may not be in the vicinity on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1901">So, everything was thought out by me and I outlined, I explained it to them, that's what it's going to be.</sentence><sentence id="1902">And after that, we have to cross another <span class="DLF">artery road</span> which was leading into the Rachen and then with the <span class="DLF">fields</span> alongside that other <span class="DLF">road</span>, we would walk until it becomes <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1903">Forested area, from that point of view that we were from the city of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> would be about maybe 10 kilometers, here you're talking about five miles; that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> would start.</sentence><sentence id="1904">So it was a smaller <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest area</span>, where they used to have hay, you know, to cut hay.</sentence><sentence id="1905">And at certain times of the year, there used to be water, you know; it was not that you could sink in, but it used to be the water.</sentence><sentence id="1906">That's why they used to, some of them, have to store their hay on elevated things for the farmers so in the winter they could come back with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleds</span> and get the hay for the feeding of their cattle and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1907">We did achieve that and I explained it to them: by good working through the night, we should achieve a target which it was called at that time, there was maleojaky (ph) and bulchenavitz (ph), the small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> was called one settlement and the bigger <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> was the other settlement.</sentence><sentence id="1908">I knew that I had some Gentiles, farmers, over there that I dealt with, with the hope that may be they could help us out.</sentence><sentence id="1909">I also did not mention over here that in the winter, I was working with a fishermen's crew while in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and this crew purposely was sent to bring fresh fish for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1910">So, while we were working on the ice over there and wherever we were sleeping, they were given <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> to sleep in, so I knew again.</sentence><sentence id="1911">So I tell them, I says, "Tonight, this was going to be for me to know that I'm on target.</sentence><sentence id="1912">I'll have to hear that much.</sentence><sentence id="1913">And, we'll have to go out to the <span class="DLF">road</span> to see because there's signs, certain signs on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1914">So we planned in the little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> away from it, over there we will have to spend the day.</sentence><sentence id="1915">And that's what we were planning to be our march, which we were talking about give or take at that night to make no more than about 10 to 12 miles.</sentence><sentence id="1916">Because, remember, we cannot march.</sentence><sentence id="1917">We did not have our dinners and suppers and breakfasts before going, so we sort of gone, it was sort of carrying us, the will was doing it, not that physically we were built to be able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1918">And as prescribed, we came to the same, I said the small <span class="DLF">pond</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1919">There were more than one <span class="DLF">pond</span>, so let's call it <span class="DLF">pond</span> instead of, you know, <span class="DLF">water ponds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1920">And now by that particular time that we got that far, we were already seeing that daylight was coming.</sentence><sentence id="1921">And with daylight coming, we were fearful; we were fearful of anything.</sentence><sentence id="1922">We were fearful for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, we were fearful for the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1923">So we decided to break and go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, find a <span class="NPIP">bushy place</span> and one would stay awake while the other three would be asleep and we would sort of maneuver around.</sentence><sentence id="1924">So it was all planned out well and that's how it was done.</sentence><sentence id="1925">They realized in the morning, now, you will see the shepherds because the <span class="REGION">area</span> used to bring 3 out the cattle for the grass feeding and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1926">And at night, evening time, they were taken back.</sentence><sentence id="1927">So since we didn't eat all night and the walking, so we decided to send Heinka, was the girl's name, Heinka, that I said she was a nurse.</sentence><sentence id="1928">Somehow or other, a female could camouflage their way more as a farm girl or farmhand than we, as men.</sentence><sentence id="1929">And she was speaking good Polish or good Russian so we decided to send her out, to the closest <span class="DLF">chimney</span>, so out to the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and you could see the smoke coming through the <span class="DLF">chimney</span>, so that means, they were over there.</sentence><sentence id="1930">So, we picked a singled out farmer, away from all the rest, and she went in there.</sentence><sentence id="1931">She said to them that she is looking for work and she mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> quite in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were, going to hit; in other words, that she comes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warla</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1932">Warla was the name of, I don't know how to translate Warla, the meaning of it in English.</sentence><sentence id="1933">But, you know, when a chicken, where the food comes in over there on the little part, that's a Warla, for instance.</sentence><sentence id="1934">You know what I'm saying.</sentence><sentence id="1935">So, that's the pocket over there.</sentence><sentence id="1936">So, that was a name, also there was a Big Warla and the Small Warla.</sentence><sentence id="1937">So, she was saying that she comes from that.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And why <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warla</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1939">That was poor farming over there.</sentence><sentence id="1940">There was nothing but sands so the <span class="DLF">fields</span> were so bare they could only grow red potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1941">And the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span> used to come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to work to earn a living, or there was a place where they used to make turpentine and the other one.</sentence><sentence id="1942">So all of them used to, that was their means of making a living.</sentence><sentence id="1943">So she pretended, because often people from that would be looking for farm work.</sentence><sentence id="1944">And she came in to that woman, and told her that she was looking for work, and if they could use her.</sentence><sentence id="1945">And they told her, no, they can't.</sentence><sentence id="1946">She says, "Do you mind sharing some food with me?</sentence><sentence id="1947">I don't have any."</sentence><sentence id="1948">And the woman asked her to sit down and eat but she did not want to.</sentence><sentence id="1949">She says, "Give me some food."</sentence><sentence id="1950">And she brought, you know what I mean a piece of bread and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="1951">Now, all four of us were sharing it and we decided to sort of sleep awake, awake and sleep; you know what I'm saying?</sentence><sentence id="1952">So we heard the shepherds coming nearby with their cattle and shepherds usually baked potatoes; that's the old time trick which shepherds would do.</sentence><sentence id="1953">They'd make them in the fire.</sentence><sentence id="1954">So we hoped that some potatoes is going to be left, which, again, if they cannot eat it, they're not taking them with.</sentence><sentence id="1955">You cannot re-bake it.</sentence><sentence id="1956">So, the same day after the shepherds left, we immediately went to follow these <span class="NPIP">places</span> to see and dig in and sure enough, we did find a few potatoes that were left over.</sentence><sentence id="1957">So there again, we had our food source for the day and that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1958">And we decided to march again.</sentence><sentence id="1959">So, to give you the perimeter, we would manage to be, assuming in our language, about two to five hundred yards away from the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1960">Therefore, you saw the <span class="DLF">telephone poles</span> as it was.</sentence><sentence id="1961">So he could go by that <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> because once you got into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, you forget where north and south and east and west is, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="1962">So, this sort of gave me like a compass-way, being in danger, when we heard any movement, either <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or stuff like this here, we immediately retreated deeper into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and stay on guard, which it happened through the course of the night, that you would see some traffic going through.</sentence><sentence id="1963">And our hope was, maybe we'd encounter partisans so we can surrender to them and beg them for help.</sentence><sentence id="1964">To make it a little bit shorter was, it took us three weeks until I finally stumbled on to one farmer -- and here I want to explain something as a note, footnote.</sentence><sentence id="1965">After two weeks almost walking around and not achieving anything, that same Soneg Bornstein (ph), he used to be in large, before the war, a columnist writer to a Jewish/Polish paper, in large, that guy.</sentence><sentence id="1966">He 4 says, "Harold."</sentence><sentence id="1967">He says, "I think we are losing track.</sentence><sentence id="1968">Look at it.</sentence><sentence id="1969">It's two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1970">We haven't seen or heard one partisan."</sentence><sentence id="1971">So, I said to him, we used to call him Sonic (ph), at that time, like in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1972">I says, "Sonic, so what do you want me to do?"</sentence><sentence id="1973">He says, "Why don't we take and make a vote whether we go forward or whether we go back."</sentence><sentence id="1974">I says, "You know, we were four of us.</sentence><sentence id="1975">If all three of you want to go back, you are welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1976">I am not going back.</sentence><sentence id="1977">If I have to be killed, I'll be killed here.</sentence><sentence id="1978">I'll go to achieve my goal, what I set forth to you."</sentence><sentence id="1979">So, they looked sort of at each other and says, "Well, we'll go with you."</sentence><sentence id="1980">I says, "Let it be clear; I will not stop.</sentence><sentence id="1981">I will not go back.</sentence><sentence id="1982">I feel as bad as it is."</sentence><sentence id="1983">Until finally, one, a few, I mean because right away that it happened; it happened quite a few days afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="1984">And I'm already by distance into the bigger <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1985">And over there, they had more like colonists, you know, one <span class="DLF">farm</span>, maybe two, three <span class="DLF">farms</span>; you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="1986">But not a settlement anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1987">And the settlement, the last one, was Slechy Podraberska (ph); again it's a name that's on the map, mapped out.</sentence><sentence id="1988">And in front of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> was the river Shars (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1989">And on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> used to be, before the hostilities, it used to be a prom (ph) as we used to call it.</sentence><sentence id="1990">A prom is like a passage way, you know, that they lead it, that it's built like on barrels like this here.</sentence><sentence id="1991">So they come and they cross the cattle or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="1992">And at that time, later on, the partisans destroyed it by the way, because we did not want to make it easy on the Germans to be able, if they go to the police, to go through.</sentence><sentence id="1993">We destroyed it and the Germans started to build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that they wanted and after they built the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, we needed it too, so we let the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> be there.</sentence><sentence id="1994">But that prom as we would call it, that passage way, we didn't like the idea.</sentence><sentence id="1995">Not we, I mean, the partisans in general, the command decided that they were going to destroy it.</sentence><sentence id="1996">So we come there and from distance I remember the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because I used to deal with them often.</sentence><sentence id="1997">The father was with one leg, and he was, and so I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1998">And his son was a blonde guy.</sentence><sentence id="1999">I recognized that I knew him.</sentence><sentence id="2000">As I come near, that dog is beginning to bark.</sentence><sentence id="2001">And the dog was on a chain, running around the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2002">That dog just was tearing my heart out, he wouldn't stop.</sentence><sentence id="2003">Before long, they're in back of me and I'm at the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2004">All of a sudden, I see a guy coming out without his shirt on, in pants, and I take a look.</sentence><sentence id="2005">He has tatoos on his hands.</sentence><sentence id="2006">With tatoos on his hands, it leaves me to believe immediately that he is Russian because local people did not have tatoos on their hand.</sentence><sentence id="2007">It wasn't, but the Russians, quite a number of them, especially a lot of them who used to serve in the Army or Navy for so many years and part of makeup, you find it a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2008">As I take a look and come closer, I see a gun.</sentence><sentence id="2009">It is in his pocket, hanging out.</sentence><sentence id="2010">I hope that you will believe me that when I tell you is exactly the way it happened.</sentence><sentence id="2011">I froze.</sentence><sentence id="2012">He pulled out the gun and he told me to stop, halt.</sentence><sentence id="2013">I halted.</sentence><sentence id="2014">And I say to him, I mentioned the farmer's name.</sentence><sentence id="2015">I say, "I want to see him."</sentence><sentence id="2016">And the son, after all of this here, seeing that the -- the guy's name is Misha Dubakof (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2017">He's a Soviet as I expected.</sentence><sentence id="2018">I came out and I recognized him, calling him by name.</sentence><sentence id="2019">He said right now to the Soviet guy, or I will call him to the easterners, is an easterner.</sentence><sentence id="2020">He says, "Put, Misha," he says, "put your gun in your pocket.</sentence><sentence id="2021">That's a friend.</sentence><sentence id="2022">I know who he is.</sentence><sentence id="2023">Let me go ahead and talk with him."</sentence><sentence id="2024">So I un-froze, sort of and I start going and I come in to him.</sentence><sentence id="2025">I shook hands with Misha first, and then with him.</sentence><sentence id="2026">And he starts asking me, "What are you going here?"</sentence><sentence id="2027">I says, "I'm looking to join the partisans."</sentence><sentence id="2028">I tell him the story already about it.</sentence><sentence id="2029">He says, "Tell them they are safe.</sentence><sentence id="2030">Let them come in here."</sentence><sentence id="2031">I start, they saw me and what had happened, they 5 immediately run away further.</sentence><sentence id="2032">Now I have a hard time with my yelling and talking, bringing them back to me.</sentence><sentence id="2033">And I keep talking to them in Yiddish, basically to understand that if I talk Yiddish, I'm safe.</sentence><sentence id="2034">And I tell them, "We are all right.</sentence><sentence id="2035">Please come out here, all of you."</sentence><sentence id="2036">And they finally come out and we all go into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2037">I get that man from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I hug him and tell him, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2038">By that time, he asks me about my brother and this and that and the other.</sentence><sentence id="2039">I says, "I cannot tell you anything."</sentence><sentence id="2040">I says, "You know, I just escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2041">It's been three weeks that I've been away from there.</sentence><sentence id="2042">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2043">Have you heard anything?"</sentence><sentence id="2044">He says, "No, nothing special had happened.</sentence><sentence id="2045">You usual."</sentence><sentence id="2046">Because this gentle people used to keep, were the ones who would keep tabs on the partisans in the same way, and they knew what had happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2047">So, at this particular time, he introduces me back to Misha Dubakof (ph), as he's the partisan.</sentence><sentence id="2048">I says, "I have one favor from you."</sentence><sentence id="2049">I did not mention it at first.</sentence><sentence id="2050">On my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> coat, I removed the star I used to wear.</sentence><sentence id="2051">At one time we were wearing round things, yellow, and at one time we were wearing the star.</sentence><sentence id="2052">I did not remove that from the bottom, but I removed it from the top that it shouldn't be seen.</sentence><sentence id="2053">Be for what it's worth, .</sentence><sentence id="2054">I says, "Misha, do me a favor and have the honors.</sentence><sentence id="2055">I want you to cut this identity of mine.</sentence><sentence id="2056">You know, as Luse the word the shameful thing of recognition.</sentence><sentence id="2057">And I says, "From now on, I won't need it anymore."</sentence><sentence id="2058">I says, "I hope I can become a partisan."</sentence><sentence id="2059">We are served to eat right now and for the first time we are seeing food?</sentence><sentence id="2060">And the farmer keeps talking to us, "You can eat.</sentence><sentence id="2061">Eat."</sentence><sentence id="2062">I says, "We've not had food in months and months so much, so we'll just eat a little bit."</sentence><sentence id="2063">And we thanked them, we did not know, crying, all of us, how to thank these people for what they did to us and he explained to us that a commander in charge of the local partisans will be here maybe in a few, not tonight, but maybe in a few days.</sentence><sentence id="2064">And Misha Dubakof (ph) therefore, is taking charge of us and he is going to go ahead and keep us comfort and covered until the, the name of the commander was Zotsof (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2065">Zotsof is rabbit, from a, like Mr. Rabbit; you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2066"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zitz</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2067">Zitzaf (ph) was like a tartar, if you know what I'm saying about a tartar.</sentence><sentence id="2068">You know, there is a nationality in Russian, the Tartars.</sentence><sentence id="2069">They are all short people and their skin is like with little holes and so on, not a smooth skin but like this here.</sentence><sentence id="2070">This man was a lieutenant in the Army.</sentence><sentence id="2071">He was left; he did not want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of war camps.</sentence><sentence id="2072">And now I must tell you how the partisans got started with.</sentence><sentence id="2073">Like Misha Dubokof (ph), like Zitsof, many decided that they did not want to fall into the hands of the Germans and they remained in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with the retreating armies.</sentence><sentence id="2074">What they used to do, find farmers who needed help.</sentence><sentence id="2075">If maybe the son was drafted or killed or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="2076">So, they would cork for their keep, only for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board.</sentence><sentence id="2077">By day, they would help him and if the Germans would come, or the police would come to the <span class="REGION">area</span>, they would be signaled by one another.</sentence><sentence id="2078">They kept on a tab and they would escape to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to hide themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2079">This is the way that the partisans really had started.</sentence><sentence id="2080">With the local people who had to run away because they were working with the former Communist government, and they knew that they must stay away, otherwise they would all be killed.</sentence><sentence id="2081">So in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span>, some of <span class="REGION">local area</span> turned in those people, to make good with the Germans; you follow me?</sentence><sentence id="2082">So, between the local left overs that were involved and between the retreating armies, those who didn't want to become prisoners of war, this is where they choose that life.</sentence><sentence id="2083">And later on, the Germans got hold of it because the Volasof's (ph) Army already was surrendering and they had all a new 6 Army of Ukrainians who used to work for the Germans now and fill-in for whatever they need, in local or on the <span class="DLF">front line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2084">So the Germans permitted all the farmers who do need help, if they see a prisoner of war, because that's how they were able to get hold of the prisoners that were in hiding, that all they have to do is register them.</sentence><sentence id="2085">Once they're registered them, they can keep them as working.</sentence><sentence id="2086">A lot of them did register and then they went on the <span class="REGION">Germans side</span>, joined the police force or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2087">Others were really killed; you know what I mean, by the Germans or sending them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2088">But, I'm talking about those who succeeded in their mission to stay out, becoming POWs or working with the farmers and that's how the partisans started.</sentence><sentence id="2089">At that particular time, the partisans, I want to tell how the rest of it a little bit later, but I want to tell about us.</sentence><sentence id="2090">We had to wait a couple of nights until Zitsof (ph), as I'll use the name, Zitsof, which he was the commander.</sentence><sentence id="2091">And like I say, he still had the ammunition, leather jacket, and everything that he was wearing at the time when they retreated.</sentence><sentence id="2092">And he was a very nervous kind of guy, heavy smoker and drinker, just as much.</sentence><sentence id="2093">But he was a skillful shooter.</sentence><sentence id="2094">He could go ahead and 1, 2, 3, you know what I mean, and aim target and have it there.</sentence><sentence id="2095">And I had the pleasure of meeting him at that time and all of us, so he came in and one by one, we went for interviews with Zitsof.</sentence><sentence id="2096">And I told him that I was sort of the leader of the group.</sentence><sentence id="2097">I helped them out, told him about myself.</sentence><sentence id="2098">He says, "Tell me, what you're doing is good.</sentence><sentence id="2099">But, what do you think we have <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> here with weapons?</sentence><sentence id="2100">I know you want to join.</sentence><sentence id="2101">We'll take you in.</sentence><sentence id="2102">Where are we going to get weapons for you?"</sentence><sentence id="2103">I says, "Where do you get weapons for the others?</sentence><sentence id="2104">Tell me and I'll get them." "</sentence><sentence id="2105">Well, you've got to go kill a policeman or German."</sentence><sentence id="2106">I says, "We are already.</sentence><sentence id="2107">Whenever you go to, that you are going to do these kind of ways, to set up an ambush, we volunteer."</sentence><sentence id="2108">He says, "Okay."</sentence><sentence id="2109">He okayed us, all four and we had a good few drinks with him together to prove it, our loyalty and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2110">And the day afterwards, we were taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">semi-camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2111">What was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2112">A <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> deep over there with big palm trees.</sentence><sentence id="2113">We used to spread out, you know what I mean, something underneath what they used to cover the horses with and that was your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2114">You did not have no pillows.</sentence><sentence id="2115">Your rifle was between your legs and that's how you were, you know, until you were, they used to have an Army, sort of, <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> set up with a fork of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> made, and buckets and that used to cook whatever we could get, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2116">Because we would have to go to farmers and wait for and ask, but this time we used to go with weapons and ask for food and we would get it.</sentence><sentence id="2117">So, we had the first taste that we joined.</sentence><sentence id="2118">The second news was that we were going to have a ambush in the next few days and all of us would go.</sentence><sentence id="2119">I was elected to climb up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and be the observer.</sentence><sentence id="2120">So I was given field glasses.</sentence><sentence id="2121">All the other ones, there was a group altogether of about ten partisans and they heard the news that Germans and the police and Fritz, which I had mentioned his name before, who was the head of the Gestapo at this time.</sentence><sentence id="2122">On this particular ambush, we, all right, Fritz remain wounded but he, they took him back, you know what I mean to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span>, but this is to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen ghetto</span> at that particular time aware of partisans that was over there, but it didn't do much good.</sentence><sentence id="2123">There was no organization.</sentence><sentence id="2124">So we went on that <span class="DLF">ambush</span> and succeeded.</sentence><sentence id="2125">And I ran to get, the first thing I got was a pistol and I got a gun from somebody else, I mean a rifle from somebody else.</sentence><sentence id="2126">And before long, as you know, all of us had weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2127">So, at least, but my job on the top of that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> was to signal to somebody 7 at the bottom of how far and how many.</sentence><sentence id="2128">The policemen were riding on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and Fritz was at that time on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> driving; that's how he used to drive.</sentence><sentence id="2129">You know, he had, sitting like a king.</sentence><sentence id="2130">You know what I mean, driving.</sentence><sentence id="2131">And there was a contingent of maybe 10 or 12, you know, call it, you know, that they wore over there.</sentence><sentence id="2132">And what do you think they used to do, come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> either to go ahead, take certain things that they wanted, food for themselves, you know, like ham and the other things.</sentence><sentence id="2133">The farmers always had it.</sentence><sentence id="2134">Or if not, they went to go to come to the farmers to have a good time.</sentence><sentence id="2135">That's where they used to come in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">junkets</span> like this here.</sentence><sentence id="2136">We attacked.</sentence><sentence id="2137">They started to retreat, but one of them got killed right away.</sentence><sentence id="2138">The other one injured, which we killed him anyways.</sentence><sentence id="2139">And Fritz escaped.</sentence><sentence id="2140">So this was my first participation as a partisan and I felt myself right now ten feet tall.</sentence><sentence id="2141">Here I got a pistol, got a rifle.</sentence><sentence id="2142">Later the pistol I gave away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zotsof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2143">He didn't want it.</sentence><sentence id="2144">They didn't let you have a pistol right away.</sentence><sentence id="2145">So I had a rifle and I was full of joy, full of hope that now I'm doing something worthwhile.</sentence><sentence id="2146">Now the story of the fights and the partisans is a big story to tell which it would take.</sentence><sentence id="2147">I wish you would tell me how much further you want me to detail on it, or to go a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="2148">So, you tell me.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2441">A: Until I reached the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, I never experienced using a weapon in my life.</sentence><sentence id="2442">And after the ambush, when I got that rifle, I asked later to be instructed of the usage of the rifle, and which I was shown how to clean it and how to use it.</sentence><sentence id="2443">And I still remember vividly the first time when I fired the first shot, which it was in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2444">But, holding the rifle the way I was instructed to hold, it gave me a bounce that I fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2445">And the instructor at that time told me, "That's all right.</sentence><sentence id="2446">Don't get scared about it."</sentence><sentence id="2447">But, you will learn that you, I held it too strong to my body instead of a little bit aiming it and having the touch and feel.</sentence><sentence id="2448">So, that was really my first experience that day, in my life, where I went away to use a weapon.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2463">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2464">The concept at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before the war was that killing was not a Jewish way.</sentence><sentence id="2465">The Jewish people did not hold guns, you know what I mean, like this here, like, in other words like joining, like a lot of people join the rifle club or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2466">In the Hasidic way of life, you could never encounter that.</sentence><sentence id="2467">I believed the news breaking about a Hasidic person holding a gun, that change came in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and it only came after World War IL.</sentence><sentence id="2468">It only came after the Holocaust when finally, the people who cherished a religion became understanding that you must learn the art of weaponry.</sentence><sentence id="2469">Because basically, historic the Jews were warriors.</sentence><sentence id="2470">They had warriors or they could never have Samson, they can never have King David and they can never could have all the era of history.</sentence><sentence id="2471">But, the Diaspora (ph) was a different element what Jews lived in and weaponry was not the form for them to be.</sentence><sentence id="2472">They were afraid, they were guests in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they felt like it, that therefore they should not antagonize by it because the only kind known to me when Jews were practicing weaponry was in Europe, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, who belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batar</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2473">But my family had no dealings with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2474">My upbringing, I ama Batar person these days but I only switched, I only changed after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2475">But in those years, I was not.</sentence><sentence id="2476">So therefore on the Jewish scene, with the exception, not 100 percent, with the exception, weaponry or rifle clubs was not a Jewish life.</sentence><sentence id="2477">And it was not part of the Jewish way of life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2493">Q: So, it was very clear to you at this time that this was the way you were going to proceed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2495">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2496">And this is why the change in my life came later, just because of that perhaps, I say that.</sentence><sentence id="2497">And that's where the change came.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2503">Q: After this ambush, what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2504">Why don't you continue?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2507">A: Well, after the <span class="DLF">ambush</span>, now, we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, trying to join the rest and just to bring to understanding an average day of life in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, what did it start?</sentence><sentence id="2508">The underground was living in at that era of time, in bushy parts of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2509">They used to see separately a company; in other words, you couldn't come into an <span class="REGION">area</span> and you found a thousand partisans.</sentence><sentence id="2510">Perhaps to find a thousand partisans, which they were in the local, was probably in ten different <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2511">So we used to be living like in <span class="BUILDING">companies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2512">A <span class="BUILDING">company</span> could consist of a maximum of 100, maybe not so close.</sentence><sentence id="2513">And then it had so many platoons.</sentence><sentence id="2514">At times used to have two platoons, at times we used to have three platoons, depending on the way it was.</sentence><sentence id="2515">And, I must mention here the commander's name; whatever his private name was, was the name of the company; like for instance, Zitsof (ph), which I joined with, the name of that company was Zitsof.</sentence><sentence id="2516">There was also Blatoz (ph), there was Fadyakomorov (ph), there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Lanskytrak</span> (ph); there were a variety of more.</sentence><sentence id="2517">And all of that goes, didn't change until about 1943 when we used to be when we started getting para troopers who used to be dropped at a bigger force of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naliboky</span> (ph) and then they used to make day away to our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2518">When the partisans were organized under the direct command of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2531">Q: What was your <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>'s name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2533">A: Leipachani (ph) forest is where I am dwelling at this time in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we were.</sentence><sentence id="2534">And I <span class="REGION">geographical area</span> would be between one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> named <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chara</span> (ph) and another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> named <span class="COUNTRY">Yemen</span> (ph) and <span class="COUNTRY">Yemen</span> was the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2535">And literally located, it was between the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slomun</span> (ph), between the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novogrudate</span> (ph), and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.883333" long="25.3">Lida</span> (ph) and that was the perimeter in which we were located, which on the map it would be found.</sentence><sentence id="2536">Now, this is the way we started; as time went on, it diversified, it became bigger.</sentence><sentence id="2537">When the Germans would attack us, at times when we became too powerful, we again would have to breakup in smaller groups, operating in various <span class="REGION">areas</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2538">The brigade used to assign areas of where which way we were.</sentence><sentence id="2539">Now, the other <span class="NPIP">part</span>, how did they achieve all of that?</sentence><sentence id="2540">They used to have like a parole or consult.</sentence><sentence id="2541">Every time, every night, or rather, every day for 24 hours, he used to be a parole name, maybe tonight, today, the next, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2542">So, the partisans would meet with partisans.</sentence><sentence id="2543">The base at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, we knew that they were also partisans because we operated at night and you couldn't, a lot of times see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2555">Q: Who gave you that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2557">A: Well, the staff which it was the general staff and the local area staff used to decide on all of these here things.</sentence><sentence id="2558">At first, when we were groups by itself, like Zitzof (ph) groups and the other, I remember we used to do it by whistles.</sentence><sentence id="2559">And I would, we used to do three whistles as a response, two whistles as a question, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2560">So it went on from time to time more modern it came when we were more organized, when the content was.</sentence><sentence id="2561">When each <span class="BUILDING">company</span> used to have a radio man, the whole tune and everything else changed.</sentence><sentence id="2562">But that didn't take place until about mid 1943 when we were equipped with our radio man 0 and immediately we could have the direct contact with the staff, let's say, from the brigade or the brigade could get immediately in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2563">For instance, at one time through 1943, when the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> began turning the other way, that the Germans were starting on the retreat.</sentence><sentence id="2564">Stalin gave an order and he talk about the partisans, but the greatest help to the war was through the partisans because we kept the Germans busy.</sentence><sentence id="2565">The more Germans we kept detained in garrisons towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, the more we kept for them towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> because they couldn't depend on the local themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2566">The last man power, they were able to send to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2567">The more <span class="DLF">mines</span> we used to explode to stop, even if it meant stopping the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, going in a certain direction to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> for one day, one day's supplies means a big deal to the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2568">So it came up on order at one time which it was coded "rail".</sentence><sentence id="2569">That was the code name, "rail".</sentence><sentence id="2570">On this night there was a direct order from Stalin that under all circumstances, wherever this is a partisan between the Soviet Union to the farthest <span class="DLF">line</span> of the front or behind.</sentence><sentence id="2571">On this night, every partisan must contribute to destroy as part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2572">In many <span class="REGION">areas</span> we were sending in small groups to make the damage bigger and in other <span class="REGION">areas</span>, it was an order that we had to fight our way because the Germans began already to watch the <span class="DLF">railroads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2573">Which again, and in the meanwhile, we gave them additional people to use for watching the <span class="DLF">railroads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2574">So they started instilling a system which it was like electrical wire but it was not the wire electrically, it was like through bells.</sentence><sentence id="2575">Then we would come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, we would stumble on something and that would sound off a sound.</sentence><sentence id="2576">So at times we would not even know.</sentence><sentence id="2577">At another times, they would go ahead and put <span class="DLF">mines</span> alongside for the <span class="DLF">infantry mines</span> so once we would come to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, therefore we could be killed or that would send off a signal and save a <span class="DLF">mine</span> from coming.</sentence><sentence id="2578">They had to include the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> to detect.</sentence><sentence id="2579">So we involved in one <span class="NPIP">way</span> or the other much grief and problems for the Germans through that.</sentence><sentence id="2580">So Stalin gave therefore that order that the rails on this night and on that night, that's why it was.</sentence><sentence id="2581">We, through power of attack, which were otherwise, everyone of us was given a piece, it looked like a white piece, they used to call it in Russian, "towel (ph)" , that's the plastic explosives as we call them of today.</sentence><sentence id="2582">It was an oblong piece like a piece; it had one piece like to put in the capsule and these capsules were various.</sentence><sentence id="2583">They were capsules where you could go ahead to detonate them, it would draw a <span class="DLF">line</span> from a distance so much away and as you pulled it, it triggered it off and you would explode it.</sentence><sentence id="2584">Other times we used more; we used to make this together in bigger amounts and put them out underneath there and wait.</sentence><sentence id="2585">We used to do it in <span class="NPIP">places</span> where it curves, on a big curve.</sentence><sentence id="2586">And on a big curve, everybody knows the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> slows down.</sentence><sentence id="2587">So before it goes into the curve, once past the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span>, we always wanted to hit the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> when we used to make an explosion because if the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> explodes, no matter how much damage you didn't do to the rest, but this here causes so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> passing that to de-rail.</sentence><sentence id="2588">So it was all strategy involved.</sentence><sentence id="2589">They used to sometimes put in a wire into the ring and that wire we used to put right near the rail so as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> would travel, it would trigger either by weight or it would trigger to touch, this here part of the wire, and the explosion would occur.</sentence><sentence id="2590">We used to retreat to quite a distance, so, but the <span class="DLF">distance</span> far enough that we would hear it, sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="2591">On other occasions, it happened, your <span class="DLF">mine</span> did not explode because it was a faulty capsule.</sentence><sentence id="2592">We did not have the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">equipment</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2593">So before we had this fancy explosives, because when we were in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>, they dropped 1 by air all of this kind of things in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and it used to be distributed to the other partisan organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2594">Before that, what we used to do, so many, as I aforementioned, the soldiers who knew ammunition and every <span class="BUILDING">company</span> has at least a few guys who knew ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="2595">They used to take, for instance, the shells from the artillery shells.</sentence><sentence id="2596">The artillery shells basically melt them out into a box or square or whatever it is and we would now how much explosives, put in just one of these here capsules to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, wire it, and you take this here and that served as an explosive.</sentence><sentence id="2597">At times, while the capsule was there, in the artillery shell, we would mend it to be able to form, to make a capsule.</sentence><sentence id="2598">There were specialists.</sentence><sentence id="2599">I, only have seen it, worked with it, I couldn't tell you, I can only tell you of one incident that one time that we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span> and we were on a very special mission, as Poles, sort of, going and on the way when we reached our mission and we turned back to go way, as partisans, and we had to demolish a few <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2600">And at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span>, I was wearing a long coat and all of us had enough to drink before.</sentence><sentence id="2601">And I remember seeing that wire almost, if that wire had been a little bit more touching it, we all would have gone to <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2602">But again, drinking was a part of the insecurity that one lived.</sentence><sentence id="2603">So, in the partisans, it used to be a slogan, vethum (ph) "let's have a drink".</sentence><sentence id="2604"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swabota</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2605">Now there is glory, today there is victory, so we got to take a drink.</sentence><sentence id="2606">Then we had another way that we were sad because we had, we suffered losses, we were ambushed or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="2607">So, of course you have to, so one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="2608">Moonshine, we did not have regular vodka, moonshine was part of the diet that I would say 99 percent of the partisans used to be involved.</sentence><sentence id="2609">And you couldn't help it, you lived at a time that the next minute, you could be dead.</sentence><sentence id="2610">You were not responsible for yourself, so that was part of the irresponsible that it was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2611">However, I think the Russian Army still is involved in a lot of drinking.</sentence><sentence id="2612">I don't say that the American Army isn't, but I'm sure it's more visible as the way the Russians were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2669">Q: You're talking about drinking and getting drunk, or drinking?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2671">A: That's the true answer, both ways.</sentence><sentence id="2672">One time, you drink for everything, celebrating, and you drink so much that you got drunk.</sentence><sentence id="2673">On the other hand, you came into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that you became drunk by not being able to handle that, you know what I'm saying? .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2677">Q: Did the drinking help seal the comraderie between the Jewish and the Soviet soldiers?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2679">A: Well, the comraderie or vice versa was no contribution to the drinking.</sentence><sentence id="2680">It was basically, we must understand that these people had lived in a poisonous area before they came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2681">The poison that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or the anyway Nazis did through all kinds of propaganda, somehow or the other penetrated to them.</sentence><sentence id="2682">And a lot of time, it was a cause why so many joined to become anti-Semites was not directly but it was just, became a part at first like in a joking way.</sentence><sentence id="2683">For instance, I remember when we got the paratroopers to us and at one time jokes started to penetrate and go around about Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2684">And the first time I ever heard the expression with the long "r" instead of abram (ph), you know, the different way.</sentence><sentence id="2685">Because a lot of Jewish people pronounced it that way.</sentence><sentence id="2686">And like one of the jokes, for instance, we were telling was, if fight, let us fight, but send me on the last 2 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2687">This is only to tell you that they existed and though existed in a more way than that.</sentence><sentence id="2688">And the biggest problem was, when we knew that this were, that the paratroopers came and trained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2689">This is why it would irritate one to realize that the poison was not planted down here, but the poison was already planted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> or other there.</sentence><sentence id="2690">We did not know at the time of the atrocities that Stalin did and the killing of Jewish people, that it went on at that time.</sentence><sentence id="2691">We didn't, this type of communications we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2692">But we did know that many in the rank, of high rank, Captain Lavida (ph), for instance, in our <span class="REGION">area</span>, in our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and he had, he's, the man was sent down for one thing, political.</sentence><sentence id="2693">He started printing a paper and that paper was distributed in the <span class="REGION">local area</span> and so was it distributed to the partisans at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="2694">As I mentioned, the politicalization of the Russians began to come back to us in the year of 1943.</sentence><sentence id="2695">And we had to listen to a little bit more coaching and teaching.</sentence><sentence id="2696">While we were at war, and we were not there, but we still, they had to bring us in.</sentence><sentence id="2697">So all these changes, changing of the name, changing in command, different things, while some of them were positive, there was a lot of negative.</sentence><sentence id="2698">And at that particular time, one could not go ahead sort of, in a way, feel out as we were so mistreated by the outside world and so many anti-Semites were around, that it was sort of small wonder, that somebody else is joining the same.</sentence><sentence id="2699">As it looked like, the whole world was against us.</sentence><sentence id="2700">And that's the feeling that we all had.</sentence><sentence id="2701">So, it used to be at times, when we were done, meaning the partisans in general, the Jews would not be all to themselves because basically, when they came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, a lot of the Jews came ina group.</sentence><sentence id="2702">For instance, in our <span class="REGION">area</span>, we had Dr. Atlas.</sentence><sentence id="2703">In our <span class="REGION">area</span> we also had the Alonzos (ph) which comes from my wife's <span class="REGION">area</span>, you know, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jetel</span> (ph) or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jachoviz</span> (ph), whichever way you want to call it.</sentence><sentence id="2704">There were groups, 100 percent Jews that they escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the massacre and they came then.</sentence><sentence id="2705">So the commander, for instance, like Dr. Atlas was there.</sentence><sentence id="2706">And he was the one who was practicing doctor, but the man went to battle.</sentence><sentence id="2707">And he gave his life in battle.</sentence><sentence id="2708">But his group was called the Dr. Atlas group.</sentence><sentence id="2709">Later after he passes on, this group changes its name and we get an escapee from the POWs by the name of Sherbin (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2710">Sherbin was a very beautiful commander, at that time when he took it over.</sentence><sentence id="2711">But, after he took it over, they did not let it be anymore the whole 100 percent Jewish, they incorporated other partisans.</sentence><sentence id="2712">So the change went on like integration.</sentence><sentence id="2713">Yes and no.</sentence><sentence id="2714">When the times were good, they didn't want to separate Jewish groups.</sentence><sentence id="2715">When the times were bad, so even the Abramofs (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2716">You know, it was at one time the commander at that time was Abramof.</sentence><sentence id="2717">In Abramof's group, there were 80 percent Jews and 20 percent non-Jews, and the mistreatment was clearly.</sentence><sentence id="2718">In other words, what kind of a word was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2719">And, you know, when, in these kind of cases, he was not Jewish, Abramof, you know; or even if he was, he was not telling about it.</sentence><sentence id="2720">And anti-Semitism was a clear venture to see in the everyday affair.</sentence><sentence id="2721">And I want, for instance, right now to dwell one day life as a partisan.</sentence><sentence id="2722">We used to have a wake up time, but now with the Army, somebody was blowing the coronet or whatever it is, but it used to be a wake up time that we had to get up.</sentence><sentence id="2723">And then we used to have to get up and there was a briefing time.</sentence><sentence id="2724">That took place already where we were under the direction.</sentence><sentence id="2725">The <span class="BUILDING">company</span> was called to order.</sentence><sentence id="2726">The commander was coming out and tell the details for the day, whatever we had, each company has to do.</sentence><sentence id="2727">Maybe this one is going for an ambush, the other one is going for provisions, the other one is going someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="2728">So, you were 3 called to order and after that, you had breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="2729">Our breakfast was, in that part of the world, you don't have a breakfast like in the <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2730">The breakfast could have consisted of good meats or something, maybe pasta mixed into it.</sentence><sentence id="2731">It was a soup and meat combination, one way or the other.</sentence><sentence id="2732">And it was on a, built like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bonfire</span> and in the middle of it a bucket.</sentence><sentence id="2733">And, so, if you had at times a Ukrainian being the chef or sort of, the cook, we ate a lot of Ukrainian-style meals.</sentence><sentence id="2734">And if we had that it wasn't a Ukrainian, so we had another style.</sentence><sentence id="2735">But the same thing that I'm bringing out, after you had your bite, then you had, there was an order everyday, cleaning the weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2736">And it was not easy to keep the weapons clean as you would, you know, as if you would be outside of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2737">You had to go ahead at times, your platoon commander would have to go ahead and check whether the weapons were cleaned.</sentence><sentence id="2738">Then, you used to sometimes go ahead, you had recruits or whatever it is that just came in.</sentence><sentence id="2739">We did not know how to handle <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2740">I remember taking my platoon at one time to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2741">When you detonate a hand grenade into a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>, there is no sound.</sentence><sentence id="2742">So we used to go ahead and teach them how you pull out the button and you hold on with your hands and throw it, because we used to have a German hand grenades; used to be with a handle, the Russians were without a handling.</sentence><sentence id="2743">They were like an egg with little schrapnels in it.</sentence><sentence id="2744">And we would go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="2745">And then we had fish afterwards, because from the explosion of that, the fish come up, surface at the top, you know what I'm saying?</sentence><sentence id="2746">So, we couldn't go ahead, for instance, to train a machine gunner how to shoot, you know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="2747">Only by explaining it.</sentence><sentence id="2748">Because it would have been, first of all, a waste of bullets which you could not afford to waste and second, it would be a give-away of the <span class="NPIP">location</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2749">So, there were a lot of things under consideration.</sentence><sentence id="2750">But, yes, the guards; every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that we set up used to have certain <span class="DLF">guard posts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2751">And the platoon commander used to have to assign from his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> who goes where.</sentence><sentence id="2752">Then there was choice for the platoon commanders.</sentence><sentence id="2753">Everyday was the man of the day; in other words, he was the commander of the day.</sentence><sentence id="2754">So, he could have been only a platoon commander but today you were in command.</sentence><sentence id="2755">So, actually, if we had to go fighting, you were instructing until the commander, the regular commander, would take over and you would go into battle.</sentence><sentence id="2756">So, the assignments were a regular routine, almost like Army life and we had to participate.</sentence><sentence id="2757">So, cleaning of the weapons; now, the attitude.</sentence><sentence id="2758">A lot of weapons, as we are talking now from between "42 and "43, the retreating armies left a lot weapons behind.</sentence><sentence id="2759">Some of the farmers took and hide some of the weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2760">We had trained enough Russian soldiers who were able to rebuilt weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2761">So, from three rifles, maybe we only rebuilt one because you couldn't, you needed a certain <span class="NPIP">part</span> here and another <span class="NPIP">part</span> there and they would skillfully do it together.</sentence><sentence id="2762">We would clean the bullets.</sentence><sentence id="2763">We did not have any other means but sand, but we'd sand.</sentence><sentence id="2764">They would have to clean and polish so we would have bullets.</sentence><sentence id="2765">A lot of it was retrieved from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> because while retreating, they put a lot in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> instead of leaving it for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2766">We pulled out of Pancer (ph), <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Pancer truck</span>, from the river Shar, and my commander at that time, Pechulud (ph) which it was his name.</sentence><sentence id="2767">And he and other crew refurbished and rebuilt it from another one; from two of this year or maybe more of them, wound up to make the motor work and everything else.</sentence><sentence id="2768">And we used it at one time, on two occasions into battle, when we had to attack.</sentence><sentence id="2769">So, the same thing achieved to build up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Howitzer</span> (ph), 122 millimeter, you know, where the sacks of the gun powder comes separately from the 4 shell.</sentence><sentence id="2770">And again, we had to retrieve these here things from what we found.</sentence><sentence id="2771">The Germans had the farmers or the <span class="REGION">local area</span> retrieve all the weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2772">At that time, they used to purposely clean it and at times, while their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would keep up these weapons, we would ambush and maybe take it from them.</sentence><sentence id="2773">It was a life of dog eat dog everyday, about obtaining.</sentence><sentence id="2774">In those years I'm talking with polishing the weapons and re-building, did not have command posts.</sentence><sentence id="2775">We did not have no orders from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and to get ammunition was the only way to get it from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2776">So we used to attack a <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>, for instance, we were able to, we attacked it basically to obtain weapons.</sentence><sentence id="2777">We knew they were going to come back, but we got so many rifles, so many machine guns, so much of the bullets, and everything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2778">So, that's what the attack on the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> served for.</sentence><sentence id="2779">Now, another daily routine which it was, where we used to be sent out in various <span class="NPIP">places</span>, to cut telephone.</sentence><sentence id="2780">Military phones, you know, in those years, you couldn't have the walkie-talkies as we know today.</sentence><sentence id="2781">So, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> had to have telephone wire.</sentence><sentence id="2782">And the connection between one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">outpost</span> to the other with wires.</sentence><sentence id="2783">And we literally would have to have groups of guys because to cut telephones, there would be enough to send a group of two, three guys; one at that stay watch and two to do the work, cutting it down.</sentence><sentence id="2784">We used to sometimes utilize civilians.</sentence><sentence id="2785">We would come into a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, take some civilians, make them be the laborers.</sentence><sentence id="2786">So the three guys, they went away and got three more farmers so each one of us could do certain jobs that much faster.</sentence><sentence id="2787">Some of the farmers did it out of cooperation with us; some of the farmers did it under the gun; we made them do it.</sentence><sentence id="2788">But, this was a regular routine of cutting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephones</span>, at times burning <span class="DLF">bridges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2789">The <span class="DLF">bridges</span> leading to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forested area</span>, we always wanted it not to be around, because we did not want to have it easy on the Germans to come in with their Penser (ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or to come in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">light tanks</span>, or whatever it is to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2790">So at times they would go ahead and lay a pentun (ph) or something and come.</sentence><sentence id="2791">But all of this here were efforts that gave us more time either to organize, either to retreat.</sentence><sentence id="2792">If we knew that a big Army was coming, it was no use to set up battle against them.</sentence><sentence id="2793">But, to send up explosive areas, to do damage, to make them believe that who knows is behind or to have a big armies to go, that's what we achieved to do.</sentence><sentence id="2794">And if I was to say to you and tell you, battle by battle, I have that recorded.</sentence><sentence id="2795">But, it would take me too much to name you the way it was organized.</sentence><sentence id="2796">I can tell you one battle in particular points which it was, which is of trying to tell you because we had girls and boys as well in our fighting.</sentence><sentence id="2797">And I'm talking about, not that I'm trying to change the subject; I'm talking about Jewish girls and boys who were not skilled in being shooters or killers, but they had to turn to the savagery of the times because that was the only way for us to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2798">One, for instance, that I left behind after I escaped, Rusha Batskin (ph) was her name, and we were, she was in part of what I said to begin with, Dr. Atlas group, and later under Shuben (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2799">She was Shuben's girlfriend, for instance; even love went on in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and babies were born in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, or they were killed, and abortions were going on in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2800">We had a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span>, sort of for a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, in hiding.</sentence><sentence id="2801">It was very well sealed.</sentence><sentence id="2802">The Germans in our <span class="REGION">area</span> never got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>; now, that's how it was sealed through little <span class="DLF">walk-ways</span> to go in, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> were they couldn't come, they couldn't come over it with heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> or anything like this here.</sentence><sentence id="2803">So, we were organized at that time knowing that the Germans are trying to come to the <span class="REGION">area</span> to collect wheat.</sentence><sentence id="2804">All the farmers -- do we have enough time to go on? .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2933">Q: We have another minute or so left?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2935">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2936">The Germans used to give to the farmers like tax, that they need from them so much wheat, so much butter, so much chickens, so much livestock and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2937">Each time, the news would be spread around to the farmers, we would get hold of the news and set up ambushes.</sentence><sentence id="2938">So, to give you an example, if we were to set up an ambush on them, and we wouldn't touch them while going to collect it, but after they made their collection, the farmers were to distribute it in this and that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2939">Then they would re-load it and start taking it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2940">So beforehand, the farmers used to bring it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2941">When the partisans became organized, no longer would we permit them to take it to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2942">So, either we would get it from the farmer and give him a receipt, or we would make an ambush and when the halting is organized, kill all the Germans or the police, and then turn around, with all of these horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with whatever it is; livestock, if not livestock, it was wheat or oats, turn them around, bring them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forested areas</span> to the poor farmers because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forested areas</span>, farmers were not well-to-do farmers.</sentence><sentence id="2943">But they allowed us to be there and give it to them.</sentence><sentence id="2944">It was taken from the rich to give it to the poor, as it said.</sentence><sentence id="2945">But in our case it was taking it from the Germans and giving it to them.</sentence><sentence id="2946">6 Tape #7</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2959">Q: Also?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2961">A: Well, this is why I made my business to go ahead and write that manuscript some 35 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="2962">Believe me, it was the wrong time that I did it, because when I did it with my English of today, it would have been published probably ten times over and would have a movie done because all these fights and going on, you know, you've seen probably partisan movies, maybe like it went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> with Marshall Tito.</sentence><sentence id="2963">He was the chief. .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2967">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2968">Hold on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2971">A: Due to the fact that the Germans were supposed to collect that contribution from the farmers of wheat, when it came to our command's knowledge, we set up an ambush.</sentence><sentence id="2972">We were trying to ambush the Germans at that particular time before.</sentence><sentence id="2973">While other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambushes</span> were done after they would have already the collection made, this time we wanted to set them up that they should come and we wanted to really show them that we are a power in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2974">On that <span class="DLF">road</span> leading to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, between the city of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> and another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudayaverska</span> (ph), since it was, that <span class="REGION">area</span> was Lipichani (ph) forest, were three, before you came to that river Shara (ph), there were three little <span class="DLF">bridges</span> on our <span class="DLF">perimeter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2975">The little <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were served from the farmers as drains from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> to go into the <span class="DLF">canals</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2976">So they were of use to the farmers and that's why they were built, was drainage of the <span class="DLF">canal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2977">We decided that we were going to use explosives on it and burn them up.</sentence><sentence id="2978">So, the first <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we decided which it was closer to the Rachen, that that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we will explode the first.</sentence><sentence id="2979">So, since our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> by way of espionage, found out and they had onlookers from the distance seeing what is coming in, so they were no Penser (ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, there were no Pensers or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> or anything like that.</sentence><sentence id="2980">It was just that they were on horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, which it was carrying the police and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2981">So, we decided at that particular time to let a certain amount, since the police used to always be in the front; the Germans used to not be in the front, but the back.</sentence><sentence id="2982">So, the police we let through first to come in there and then we decided to blow the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2983">When the explosion of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> was, was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> got caught in the delay and it blew up because of the gasoline and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2984">Immediately they descended into both sides of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, starting to shoot on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> and we saw their <span class="NPIP">positions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2985">So once they started to shoot clear and they got up, we immediately started to shoot against them.</sentence><sentence id="2986">So, then they were in total confusion, because on this side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> was shooting to them and on this side.</sentence><sentence id="2987">But the way we were placed in such a position that we should not, our fire shouldn't be shot against each other on the other side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2988">But in this particular time, the way the Germans laid themselves out, it was almost sort of the way it was meant to be, that our fire would go against them and not against our own across.</sentence><sentence id="2989">So when we started shooting, when we started firing, all of a sudden, hands went up to the top.</sentence><sentence id="2990">Those big heroes, the Germans, as well as the police, no longer were tough guys and they started to plead and beg.</sentence><sentence id="2991">Ammunition on the side was collected and we started lining 7 up.</sentence><sentence id="2992">Among the Germans over there, there were the Desunden Freur (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2993">On our side of the <span class="DLF">perimeter</span>, I was at that time a machine gunner and I had a Russian type of machine gun with a round disc on the top and I was placed from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> were to attack and where to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="2994">And before long I found out that we had a casualty of someone that I knew close, which was a girl, tall girl and a brave girl.</sentence><sentence id="2995">She always used to go to battle whenever her brothers.</sentence><sentence id="2996">She was with three brothers together and one of them used to be a machine gunner, used to, Anamoxinkas (ph), we used to call him.</sentence><sentence id="2997">Anamoxinkas is a water-cooled machine gun.</sentence><sentence id="2998">And her other brother, which it was the oldest one, became at that particular time the commander of the platoon, of the former Dr. Atlas's group.</sentence><sentence id="2999">And she was the casualty of the day.</sentence><sentence id="3000">She was shot from this, when I said the Germans started to shoot on this <span class="NPIP">side</span>, so she was a casualty and we just found it out.</sentence><sentence id="3001">As I go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to clear, to look for Germans or police who were either wounded or whatever it is, I come and near me I see another girl from the Rachen, which she was also with us all the time, Rasha Baskin (ph) is her name.</sentence><sentence id="3002">I don't know her whereabouts today, because when I escaped the Soviet Union, she was, she remained behind and I have no contact with her.</sentence><sentence id="3003">But, she spotted, she says, "Look, Harold.</sentence><sentence id="3004">Look, Harold.</sentence><sentence id="3005">Here's the Zundenfuer (ph)."</sentence><sentence id="3006">.The Zundenfuer means that he was the head of the <span class="REGION">region</span> from the Gestapo, and he was there.</sentence><sentence id="3007">And as we approached him, I approached him now with the machine gun, she had at that time a rifle only in her hand, and he says to her, "Don't."</sentence><sentence id="3008">And he starts pleading we shouldn't kill him, whereupon he pulls out a pocket from his pocket, photographs of the Rachen girls.</sentence><sentence id="3009">Whatever this man, either he was in love with them or had love affairs with them or what, we at that time did not know.</sentence><sentence id="3010">And neither did I want to listen, so I wanted to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="3011">She starts pleading with me, "Harold he is mine.</sentence><sentence id="3012">You're not going to kill him.</sentence><sentence id="3013">I am."</sentence><sentence id="3014">And she basically, with the rifle went and smashed his head to pieces, because after seeing the pictures of these girls, we know any SS guy or Gestapo who has pictures from girls which they used to do at practice, have sex with them, then taking pictures with them yet, understand.</sentence><sentence id="3015">All of them, you know what I mean, to put into sort of their collections.</sentence><sentence id="3016">Now, at one time, I must say, that I had to give a good reason and a good thanks to Rasha Baskin for killing a person.</sentence><sentence id="3017">And it was beyond my personal belief, in a way, but in battle you see the enemy and you don't see anything else.</sentence><sentence id="3018">And that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="3019">And we moved on.</sentence><sentence id="3020">Of course, she says she's going to take his gun.</sentence><sentence id="3021">I let her take his gun because trophies; there was plenty of ammunition for everyone to pick up.</sentence><sentence id="3022">By that time, I had a German luger at that time that I took and I wanted to carry it, but at that time I turned it in to the command because what would I do for getting bullets for a German luger?</sentence><sentence id="3023">It was easy for us to get bullets from Russian-type guns than to get for Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3024">We used to get enough ammunition of theirs, but that was hard.</sentence><sentence id="3025">Now, after the first <span class="DLF">battle line</span> was over, our command ordered us to go back to <span class="NPIP">position</span>, only changing position because we expected that this will not be the last battle.</sentence><sentence id="3026">So all of these killed, including the Zundenfeur (ph), the officer, our command ordered to go ahead, to strip their uniforms off of them and just naked and covering with a blanket, put them back on a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we took one of the farmers, send them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to turn in their corpses and give them a note, "Don't fight us, because that's the way you're going to see the rest of you come back."</sentence><sentence id="3027">It's true enough that we were there and the following day the commander decided that we should be on guard again because they probably will send in 8 a second force.</sentence><sentence id="3028">And they did.</sentence><sentence id="3029">On the second force what they sent, that's why I could understand why they went to burn up the last <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to us, but the first <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to them.</sentence><sentence id="3030">And the other two, we mined at this time, one at a time.</sentence><sentence id="3031">They came with a light <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> at this time and they came, again, Germans and they had the police which they were a makeup of Ukrainians and the other Russians and they started to do the same thing and we again let them cross that second <span class="DLF">bridge</span> before the explosion was made.</sentence><sentence id="3032">The explosion got at this time, caught that small task that they had.</sentence><sentence id="3033">And it was done, you know, they couldn't have maneuvered; they would have to have heavy equipment to pull it out, which they came days afterwards to try to pull it out because of fear that the partisans may go ahead right now and re-build it.</sentence><sentence id="3034">You know what I mean?</sentence><sentence id="3035">They got espionage the same way as we did, to know what we were up to.</sentence><sentence id="3036">And again that was <span class="DLF">battle line</span> number two.</sentence><sentence id="3037">We were still waiting and a couple of days later they sent a bigger force again and again at this time, we ensued battle and realizing the roar of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that it came a big force.</sentence><sentence id="3038">Our command decided to retreat and we retreated to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3039">Then they came in with a bigger force to the farmers at that time for the contingent what they had to get from them of the wheat, but at this time we could not control it.</sentence><sentence id="3040">But the mere fact was that in order for them to collect the taxed wheat or provisions from the farmers, no longer could be gotten from these <span class="REGION">areas</span> without a fight.</sentence><sentence id="3041">So we achieved our purpose that we made this fight.</sentence><sentence id="3042">Before long a change in all of that had happened.</sentence><sentence id="3043">The Germans decided to build, as they called, a self-defense team.</sentence><sentence id="3044">And in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span>, they were ordered to join on doing that.</sentence><sentence id="3045">They used to hang up a piece of rail or a bell and as soon as partisans would show in that vicinity, the bell or the rail piece would start making noise on the ring.</sentence><sentence id="3046">It would carry from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> to the other, until it would come to the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3047">Then the police would have to come out, put some on ambush or come searching to catch the partisans.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3125">Q: Who did this?</sentence><sentence id="3126">The local people did it for the Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3129">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3130">They did it for the Germans to alert them that partisans are out.</sentence><sentence id="3131">And in the meanwhile, they would send a force against us.</sentence><sentence id="3132">On three occasions, luck was with me, that I was struck on this type of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambushes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3133">And either my number wasn't up or my alertness was good, that I was able to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, because we used to use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> to come there.</sentence><sentence id="3134">And I shoved myself up, turned over on my belly, into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and three days later I showed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, on each of these occasions.</sentence><sentence id="3135">I don't mean on that particular day; on each of these occasions, when I came, I was looked upon like I returned from <span class="NPIP">death</span> because they already had given up on me, because a number of us used to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="3136">And the command decided that no longer could that be tolerated.</sentence><sentence id="3137">Otherwise, we would have to leave the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3138">And leaving the <span class="REGION">area</span> was not saying we'll move on elsewhere.</sentence><sentence id="3139">The elsewhere, if it works, it will work elsewhere the same way.</sentence><sentence id="3140">Our command decided on teaching a lesson and we had to do it the German way.</sentence><sentence id="3141">We took a <span class="DLF">farm area</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lansovicha</span> (ph) and we surrounded it one morning with our troops.</sentence><sentence id="3142">There were a few hundred people in participation.</sentence><sentence id="3143">And the first thing, we waited for somebody to come and hitting the bell.</sentence><sentence id="3144">Somebody did come and as soon as he hit the bell, machine gun was fired and that man was dead and more people who started 9 to run out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, were dead.</sentence><sentence id="3145">They realized the casualties and all of them began all of a sudden to be alert.</sentence><sentence id="3146">We started a fire because their <span class="DLF">roofs</span> were made out of straw and we had the special bullets, fire bullets, to start fire, on purposely to make a little panic.</sentence><sentence id="3147">While a certain group of ours were taking charge of the livestock, everybody tried to drive their livestock out because they were afraid it will burn up, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3148">So, while they were, the farmers were driving out, our people were taking over, lining them up and they were driven to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> while our command decided to share this cattle among the poor farmers in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3149">That was left to be a lesson that any settlement that will cooperate with the Germans and will alert our moves, whatever partisans in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, can expect the same treatment as Lansovich (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3150">And that, after that, they didn't remove it, from there on, after that time that it happened, the farmers in the <span class="REGION">area</span> understood that either, if you listen and do for the Germans, you'll get killed from the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="3151">And if you listen the other way, you'll get killed from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3152">So, therefore, they tried to play a little bit of a different game.</sentence><sentence id="3153">And it no longer was the success as the Germans anticipated it would.</sentence><sentence id="3154">The reason that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peklansavichy</span> (ph) was because from that settlement, there were a number of guys serving in the police force in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3155">And we had our contact man who our command could get all information needed, because we also had local people who were working on our side and they were actually against the Germans and what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="3156">But, it had to be done in a hiding kind of way.</sentence><sentence id="3157">The story, after that what had happened with that battle, changed.</sentence><sentence id="3158">And really, here, at one time, we made almost like calling a massacre because quite a number of casualties.</sentence><sentence id="3159">The farmers would go out and start pleading, "Don't burn, don't burn up my <span class="DLF">farm</span>," and this and that and the other.</sentence><sentence id="3160">And we knew the families that were there;

after it was all over and the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> retreated back, that's when around this here <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> where the police force was staying, they built a <span class="DLF">wall</span> with <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> that if we were to have this here kind of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> before, we would never be able to succeed to attack.</sentence><sentence id="3536">We made use of the time, since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span>, that the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> became busy, slaughtering meat, and it was salted down into wooden barrels and sent to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> by a contingency of partisans that we had who were capable of making salami and so on, and they were salted down as to food and scattered around the various parts of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, which only a few people knew.</sentence><sentence id="3537">So, in the event we should have been surrounded and not be able to go out, that we should be able to have supplies for where to survive.</sentence><sentence id="3538">My good friend, Barnovsky, (ph) was leading on, we told of this year, doing, he was a butcher by 5 trade and he knew the art of making the salami and all of that do.</sentence><sentence id="3539">So, he was leading and it became a very busy <span class="NPIP">place</span>, that <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3540">To tell you, we kept it for almost three months and until the Germans decided to make an onslaught and come back to return to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3541">With Zidsov (ph) as I went into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I came into a Gentile person who knew even my grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="3542">And he touched me badly, the way he said it in Russian, " ," which translated into English, means, "Are you still alive?"</sentence><sentence id="3543">And it rubbed me the wrong way.</sentence><sentence id="3544">Had I not had Commander Zitsov with me, I would have ended him right there.</sentence><sentence id="3545">But being with my Commander Zitsov with me, I pretended that I didn't take it, instead of him showing the joy that I am alive, he asked me, "Are you still alive?"</sentence><sentence id="3546">So, and that rubbed me in the wrong way and he ordered us, he ordered for him and his wife to make breakfast for us and a few more from the command came into the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3547">And even though we had to drink and to eat, but these few words never left me.</sentence><sentence id="3548">And I had a hard time, sort of, forgetting about it, that even after I left all of my family and lost them over here, that that man would have the audacity to ask me, one person who remained alive, in these words, with his cruel words: "Are you still alive?"</sentence><sentence id="3549">And he thought that that was a way of greeting me.</sentence><sentence id="3550">In other words, that he sort of jokingly thought.</sentence><sentence id="3551">I did not make any mention in front of my commander, but my anger was burning in me, coming back in the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I did not even know which of the <span class="DLF">holes</span> my family is buried, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3552">Because they threw lime afterwards on it and it was brought to burial, the <span class="REGION">area</span>, after the war when the partisans returned to the <span class="BUILDING">Rachen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3553">It was a big piece of news for the whole <span class="REGION">area</span>, because the respect date.</sentence><sentence id="3554">And what we invited upon ourselves, after that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, after that Rachen occupation and what we do.</sentence><sentence id="3555">That the Germans had to bring a tremendous force in surrendering all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, extending maybe in diameter, maybe 30 to 40 miles.</sentence><sentence id="3556">Which, again, for the Soviet Union, it served a good purpose.</sentence><sentence id="3557">When they have to take in one <span class="REGION">area</span> to use so much military to do a big job like that, the <span class="DLF">front line</span> is .</sentence><sentence id="3558">That's when the Soviets were winning.</sentence><sentence id="3559">But, it was a lot of casualties on our part and that Fall, when they made, because we were so sure of ourselves that we became too cocky.</sentence><sentence id="3560">We used to travel by day, coming to the <span class="BUILDING">Rachen</span>; going here and doing there.</sentence><sentence id="3561">We thought there is no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that it can stop us.</sentence><sentence id="3562">And this is the time that we relaxed a little bit too much and the casualties happened.</sentence><sentence id="3563">So then we heard the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> coming in, we started on the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> from all <span class="NPIP">places</span> to put up, at that time, a defense.</sentence><sentence id="3564">And we didn't wait for them to attack us, we started to attack them, realizing the kind of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the kind of fighting that no longer were we dealing with the police, the local alone, but at this time we were dealing with a trained Army.</sentence><sentence id="3565">So, our command immediately recognized the situation and they broke through an <span class="REGION">area</span> in a few <span class="NPIP">places</span> to make it, and we were ordered to retreat.</sentence><sentence id="3566">We retreated until the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> almost around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilda</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3567">It was very, a traumatic move at that time for us, that all of a sudden, we had to, I would say in miles, I would say we must have retreated about 150 yards from our base.</sentence><sentence id="3568">The good part of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">base</span> was that we knew the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlements</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3569">We knew which way it leads.</sentence><sentence id="3570">And then you come in a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> altogether, it was hard to go ahead to carry out any of the type of work that they did over there.</sentence><sentence id="3571">So it was a set back port partisans.</sentence><sentence id="3572">The good news however was that after that, we saw the paratroopers come in to the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3573">So, 1943, about mid, we decided to organize a new action.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3630">Q: I want to go back for a moment.</sentence><sentence id="3631">You have mentioned on and off a Dr. Atlas.</sentence><sentence id="3632">I believe he was also involved in that battle, so I want you to tell me something about him.</sentence><sentence id="3633">Who was he?</sentence><sentence id="3634">What kind of a man he was?</sentence><sentence id="3635">What he was doing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3642">A: At the battle of the Rachen, Dr. Atlas was involved.</sentence><sentence id="3643">And he retreated away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rachen</span> quickly.</sentence><sentence id="3644">Not with his troops, because he had some medical missions that he had to attend to at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="3645">While he was the commander, he still used to attend to certain patients, which was farmers.</sentence><sentence id="3646">His good rule, what he did to the farmers helped us with leads of informers that we could get.</sentence><sentence id="3647">And because they wanted Dr. Atlas to continue with the work, we prospered with it.</sentence><sentence id="3648">So, yes; he was in the battle.</sentence><sentence id="3649">He originally was leading his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> over there to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Rachen</span>, but he after it was over, the fight was over, he had to retreat.</sentence><sentence id="3650">His men remained there.</sentence><sentence id="3651">Now, for instance, we knew a few casualties of the Rachen boys who did lose their life, like I mentioned before.</sentence><sentence id="3652">Benjamin Dumbrovsky, he lost his brother at that particular time.</sentence><sentence id="3653">But all the casualties we had were due to bravery; they were really fighting and they really wanted to see and show the police over there that somebody has got to be accountable for the way they did in that massacre against the Jews so well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3666">Q: Did his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> come from that <span class="REGION">area</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3668">A: The platoon that he was leading was, I would say, about 80 percent of the Jewish people who came from the Rachen and they came after the massacre of the Rachen.</sentence><sentence id="3669">That's why they were so eager in the fight of to go back and sort of, vengeance was a good driving force in them, to do what they were doing at the present time.</sentence><sentence id="3670">So, it was not idealogy in part, all the way, that they were trying to fight for the Soviets, but a lot of times it was vengeance against those who did so cruel to our families there.</sentence><sentence id="3671">So his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">platoon</span> remained until afterwards when the General's staff ordered everybody to retreat.</sentence><sentence id="3672">Because after the first day, or the second day, we used to go back by day to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and by night come and still do that.</sentence><sentence id="3673">We did not want to get caught in the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that the Germans should go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="3674">So we used to have, more or less, platoons, a platoon maybe would stand guard and about on the lookout over there.</sentence><sentence id="3675">But the whole Army was where we were, about five or six hundred partisans, were sent back to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3676">Dr. Atlas was also a DP like I was myself.</sentence><sentence id="3677">I knew him not like I knew, for instance, the other doctors; no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3688">Q: But you came in contact with him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3690">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="3691">It's worth mentioning here, about Dr. Atlas's past.</sentence><sentence id="3692">He was a displaced person, like I.He was someplace from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3693">And that man practiced medicine all the time and with the German onslaught, the way it happened, he decided to be treating patience on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3694">So he, instead of remaining in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, was away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he used to, sort of, be the doctor of the farmers.</sentence><sentence id="3695">And they did not disclose him from the Germans, to the Germans, rather.</sentence><sentence id="3696">With the onslaught and organization of partisans, as soon as he heard about partisans in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, he came voluntarily and joined but he still maintained a good relationship with the <span class="REGION">farming area</span> over there and they became very useful to the 7 partisans, right now for the information.</sentence><sentence id="3697">He was a man about my height, slimmer than me, I mean you know, I wasn't as fat as I am now, but a little slimmer.</sentence><sentence id="3698">And he had one thing, you could see fire in this man, talking to his guys all the time about vengeance and fight. "</sentence><sentence id="3699">When you going to fight, fight to the end.</sentence><sentence id="3700">Fight to win."</sentence><sentence id="3701">And he was a good leading commander.</sentence><sentence id="3702">We had a lot more of, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buloks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3703">Bulok was a local commander who had mostly Gentiles, or the other Russians, not so much of the Soviets, true Soviets, who remained in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that didn't go into the prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="3704">But he organized his group mostly from his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement area</span> and around there.</sentence><sentence id="3705">So the people, as I say, his group, they all used to ride more, a lot on horses.</sentence><sentence id="3706">So, they would come because they had their own <span class="DLF">farms</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3707">So a lot of them used to have to man the <span class="DLF">farms</span>, and at night, whatever the partisans needs was today, they would be working on that <span class="DLF">front line</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="3708">But the unfortunate situation happens, Dr. Atlas, in one of the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambushes</span>, which it was following after the liberation of the Rachen, that's when Dr. Atlas is killed in battle.</sentence><sentence id="3709">So, I mean, he didn't die just a normal death.</sentence><sentence id="3710">He was killed while fighting, being a fighter and commanding.</sentence><sentence id="3711">That's when the takes over.</sentence><sentence id="3712">That man, I just mentioned, misfortunately meets his death in , in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, while on his way escaping the Soviet Union, and while on the way in a kubutz (ph) which it was illegal immigration to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3713">And being <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on patrol, a Polak shot and killed him.</sentence><sentence id="3714">As you've heard perhaps or not, that in and in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, after 1945, when the war as over, and the Jews were running from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or from hiding, they still were not ready to give away what they robbed from the Jews, so they had one way of doing it: kill them.</sentence><sentence id="3715">And therefore, we know later on, what went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3716">So, a lot of these guys like , met their death after liberation.</sentence><sentence id="3717">And it was a big hurt to feel that a guy was patriotic all the way and that that was the way for him to die.</sentence><sentence id="3718">So, why almost after three years in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, or two and a half years, rather, and being in battle and to come out all right.</sentence><sentence id="3719">In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> he only lost his sister.</sentence><sentence id="3720">His brothers, the other two brothers that survived, to the best of my knowledge, are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3753">Q: Now, we have I guess about ten more minutes and I'm wondering.</sentence><sentence id="3754">There are two thoughts that I have.</sentence><sentence id="3755">Either, and maybe you can explain to me about this reorganization that took place?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3759">A: Yep.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3761">Q: Or possibly tell me about an experience, or running into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span>, whichever you think is appropriate at this point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3763">A: Well, I can tell you first about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span>, rather than getting into this subject, because that's a more lengthy subject to talk about.</sentence><sentence id="3764">I did not mention at great length, that in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> there were also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3765">However, let us make clear about it.</sentence><sentence id="3766">When I use that word, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span>, I only mean others an expression.</sentence><sentence id="3767">It was not a camp of people with families or elderly, that they were supervised by others.</sentence><sentence id="3768">It's just that they were, sort of, not elected to be able to be among the fighting force.</sentence><sentence id="3769">And therefore, when we came to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, escaping from the massacres, there was only one thing for them to 8 do, and that was to be in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3770">So, a lot of them, a majority of them who were capable, joined one company or the other and they were there.</sentence><sentence id="3771">And those who couldn't, for instance, had the lot left to them to be there.</sentence><sentence id="3772">Every time the Germans attacked the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, the ambush or otherwise, the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> or small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> were the first prey that they attacked.</sentence><sentence id="3773">And at times, it was, they were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, sort of, with victory, thinking that they killed partisans while they actually, the one that they killed was the ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3774">Because as soon as the shooting was started, not too far where we were in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, so we would exactly, at that particular time join and attack them instead of.</sentence><sentence id="3775">And from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span>, they had an easy prey.</sentence><sentence id="3776">All they could throw is a few hand grenades, open up a machine gun and boom, then they found them.</sentence><sentence id="3777">So, those who were living in hiding survived the massacre, or the onslaught.</sentence><sentence id="3778">Those who were not living in hide outs, but they just lived in the <span class="DLF">open</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3779">They were first prey.</sentence><sentence id="3780">So, the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> was, while we had so many fighting groups, really, no one cared to provide the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> with provisions, even food or clothing.</sentence><sentence id="3781">However, some of them had relatives, brothers or other ones, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fighting camps</span>, which they would care to bring something.</sentence><sentence id="3782">But, it was never an organized effort by the partisans, in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I was in.</sentence><sentence id="3783">I don't know what it was in other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>; maybe in other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> it was different.</sentence><sentence id="3784">But, I believe that we would have heard about it and know about it.</sentence><sentence id="3785">They were an open prey.</sentence><sentence id="3786">They escaped.</sentence><sentence id="3787">At types, they used to have problems with the partisans.</sentence><sentence id="3788">The partisans, especially the women, and there were younger girls; the partisans, in most cases the Gentiles, would come and rape them, attack them in this way.</sentence><sentence id="3789">So they were open prey to all kinds of enemies: our local enemies, the partisans which they couldn't protect themselves from, and against the Germans and the police when they would attack and they would normally, you know what I mean, pick their <span class="NPIP">spots</span> as of their probably spies them where they were located and that's what it would be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3817">Q: Did, do you think that Jewish members of the partisans ever took advantage of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> in that way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3819">A: The Jewish guys used to help one way or the other, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3820">But, that was, again, a not official way, it was an unofficial way.</sentence><sentence id="3821">That we would sometimes drop some food over there.</sentence><sentence id="3822">But we were starting to stop over there to visit and usually we would come with some food leaving them.</sentence><sentence id="3823">But it was not a case that a command told us, "Hey, why didn't you deliver some potatoes from wherever you can, or something else, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="3824">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> were strictly left on their own and if we were to have the figures at hand and starting to make justification or comparisons, we would find that the biggest amount of casualties as per amount coming to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3831">Q: Was there constant enemy presence?</sentence><sentence id="3832">I mean, were you always afraid of bombing and advances?</sentence></p></dialogue>
