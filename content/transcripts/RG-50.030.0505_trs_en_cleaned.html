<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="744">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="746">Q: Yes, okay.</sentence><sentence id="747">Did you see them?</sentence><sentence id="748">Those Jews who went out and th -- you didn't --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: No, no, no.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="750">Q: -- you didn't go there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="752">A: No, I didn't go there, no.</sentence><sentence id="753">But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and Lithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between two super powers.</sentence><sentence id="754">And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn't be different, that for Lithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians still, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better.</sentence><sentence id="755">And I learned now recently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people were deported, and how many people came back from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="756">So I was told that in "41, the last</sentence><sentence id="758">1 information is 17,000.</sentence><sentence id="759">After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000.</sentence><sentence id="760">So -- including the Jews, who were also deported.</sentence><sentence id="761">So, as a whole, about 150,000.</sentence><sentence id="762">Now, from the people who were deported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not very precise figures.</sentence><sentence id="763">And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until deg51 or deg50 -- I don't know how long, think un-until "51, or maybe "53, I don't remember now exactly, the deportation -- 70 percent came back.</sentence><sentence id="764">From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it was still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it's a paradox, but in some way they were saved.</sentence><sentence id="765">And for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and he could -- he suffered his whole life.</sentence><sentence id="766">Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his whole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation.</sentence><sentence id="767">They got killed in -- in the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="768">So it is -- yeah.</sentence><sentence id="769">But, also among the Lithuanian, I would say, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volkspartei, the -- no, they were not socialists, but close to socialists.</sentence><sentence id="770">So they were thinking, what's better, the Germans or the Soviets?</sentence><sentence id="771">And they decided better the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="772">Why?</sentence><sentence id="773">Because under <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, under the German governance, for instance, <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="774">No -- no -- no traces of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> any more.</sentence><sentence id="775">And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn't disappear, but we developed our, in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, the resistance movement.</sentence><sentence id="776">The -- the -- re-revival of the nation.</sentence><sentence id="777">So, that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="778">Then also, some people, they're fascinated, like for instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they were fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet Union, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights.</sentence><sentence id="779">So it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the</sentence><sentence id="781">2 German army was met by Lithuanians with flowers.</sentence><sentence id="782">So -- but that's also understandable, because it was like saving from the deportation to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="783">Was a very complicated situation, and is very interesting that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not -- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed.</sentence><sentence id="784">So it is also in the <span class="REGION">region</span> where the Soviets were before, where the deportations took place, and so on, you see?</sentence><sentence id="785">Then there is also another such moment, which can't be forgotten.</sentence><sentence id="786">Of course in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, the Jews had cultural autonomy and -- autonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="787">Jews couldn't take government positions, high up positions in the army.</sentence><sentence id="788">They served in the army, but not on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on.</sentence><sentence id="789">And they didn't feel like equal citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that's a very short time.</sentence><sentence id="790">And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody's equal, and quite a few Jews got into the administration, got into, you know, official positions.</sentence><sentence id="791">I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it was like an illusion that now we are equal.</sentence><sentence id="792">But this was absolutely illusion.</sentence><sentence id="793">And i -- and I must say ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother, Jorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and he came back and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of course, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="794">So, you see, he was still a -- a very much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on.</sentence><sentence id="795">But -- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very complicated.</sentence><sentence id="796">I don't know if I expressed myself clearly now.</sentence></p></dialogue>

became a little bit dangerous to stay there because they were all very good people, but you know, sometimes when they got drunk, they got -- they were talking too much.</sentence><sentence id="2345">And also, he was engaged to a woman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span>, Janni, who of course didn't know that I lived there, and some rumors came that a young girl lives with him, so she got a little bit like jealous and wanted to find out who is this girl, so I had to disappear from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2346">And then I got to -- to a family of a Lithuanian Colonel Meskauskas, who was arrested by the Soviets already, in "41, to his widow and daughter, who lived on <span class="DLF">Gedimino
