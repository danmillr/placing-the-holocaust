<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: And can you describe to me a little more in terms of a physical description, your <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a rather elegant <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">It was situated right above these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, which were at ground level.</sentence><sentence id="195">My grandfather owned the property, and there were at least three to four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span>, a large <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, then there was -- the living was qua -- w-was -- the efs -- there was [speaks German], which is a <span class="INT_SPACE">smoking room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">So it's a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">smoking room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">My parent's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, my brother's <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and mine, and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">guest bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">And everything was rather elegantly furnished.</sentence><sentence id="199">We had a maid who took care of my brother and myself.</sentence><sentence id="200">Her name was Alvina, and she was with us for many, many years.</sentence><sentence id="201">I have a picture even now of Alvina and my brother and I being at the wedding and I was the flower girl, age about four or five years old, with little flowers in the hair.</sentence><sentence id="202">But I do have the picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alvina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">She married a man who was a carpenter, and my parents asked this ge -- this gentleman to make a copy of our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, so I had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, a replica of my parent's <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and as a child I played with that a great deal.</sentence><sentence id="204">And when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> my par -- parents actually sent that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">children's furniture</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">What happened to it, I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: They were happy memories and I remember the first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, where my friend Ruth Lindheimer [indecipherable] and I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="225">And children at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> get like a big bag, like a huge cone out of cardboard, and that is filled with candy and toys and pencils.</sentence><sentence id="226">So that was a very happy kind of memory.</sentence><sentence id="227">That was approximately 1935, and I was at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> until the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was closed, and that was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: So one of your first memories is -- is probably the first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and -- and tell me more about <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, other memories you have of the early days of being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: I guess things were still quite normal in the early days.</sentence><sentence id="235">For instance, Hebrew was taught from the beginning on, like a foreign language.</sentence><sentence id="236">Later on I would learn a foreign language by translation.</sentence><sentence id="237">And so we translated prayers, and not only learned to translate word for word, but also how to make little sentences, so that we had a fairly good knowledge of Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="238">I can still read Hebrew, although I must say that when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I had little contact later on with Jewish people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="244">Q: So you were at a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="246">A: Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was religious and the headmaster's name was Luntner, Herr Luntner.</sentence><sentence id="247">That family had five children in various ages from -- some -- the older one was called yo -- Jota, and she came with me to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> on the day I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">But <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a happy time, and it seemed perfectly normal, we did the usual things, like gymnastics.</sentence><sentence id="249">I would walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it was not very far, probably a 10 minute walk.</sentence><sentence id="250">And having been back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> a couple of years ago, I saw the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> again.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="256">Q: Do you know the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="258">A: Yeah, this was the Juda [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">How many chil -- students were there, I don't know, but I do have a picture of all the students</sentence><sentence id="262">together, taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> at a time when my brother and I were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together, and my friend Ruth, and her present husband Henry are also on that picture.</sentence><sentence id="263">There are approximately 40 students on that photo which I have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="272">Q: Now tell me a little more about your brother, his personality and when you were very young, did the two of you get along, did you fight?</sentence><sentence id="273">Tell me about him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: Well, my brother was, as I said, five years older than I, and he seemed to be very proud of having a little sister.</sentence><sentence id="277">He often told me later on as we were growing up that he said [speaks German here].</sentence><sentence id="278">In other words that means I or -- put in an order for you.</sentence><sentence id="279">So he was very proud of having a little sister.</sentence><sentence id="280">Although, as I grew up, I think I was sometimes a bit of a burden when my parents said they had to take me along, and I would drag behind all these boys, who were teenagers by then, and they had to take along the younger sister.</sentence><sentence id="281">So it wasn't always great fun for him, but perfectly normal.</sentence><sentence id="282">However, my brother took great responsibility for me.</sentence><sentence id="283">Obviously, my parents must have said that he should keep an eye on me always, and he always did because the two of us were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, even though we were not together.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: And what about, since you were at a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, I'm imagining the other students are Jewish, did you have any non-Jewish friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: I can't remember any discrimination, but I actually don't think that among my circle of friends that there were non-Jewish friends, because they were probably children I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, and children whose parents my parents knew.</sentence><sentence id="295">So I don't have any real collection -- recollection of anyone non-Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: Now, when the Nazis came to power, you were very young.</sentence><sentence id="299">And tell me what your very earliest memories are about the beginning of the Nazis and the Hitler regime.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="305">A: You know, times were not like they are today where you put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span> and you see instantly what is happening in some other part of the world.</sentence><sentence id="306">And I think my parents shielded us from any extra worries, or extra concerns.</sentence><sentence id="307">However, I do remember seeing signs in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> that said, Juden [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="308">That means, Jews are not welcome here.</sentence><sentence id="309">And I would question that sort of thing by -- because I could read by then.</sentence><sentence id="310">In 1933, Hitler came to power on my birthday, January 30".</sentence><sentence id="311">Other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> had a holiday because Hitler was in power, it was a day off from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">Not in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>, we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">And then one day, coming from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and this would be closer to like 1938, other kids would call across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, look at those Jews, look at those Jewish children, and the kids would throw stones at us.</sentence><sentence id="314">And I said -- I could not understand, why would they be throwing stones at us, we weren't doing anything.</sentence><sentence id="315">And you'd run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as quick as possible.</sentence><sentence id="316">So these are my first bad feelings on knowing that something was going on beyond our control.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Well, you would run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you would probably talk to your parents about this.</sentence><sentence id="330">What were they telling you?</sentence><sentence id="331">Do you remember any of the discussions with your parents?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="539">A: Since that was my parent's wish, to have us in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>, my parents were actually very clever, because when I think about how my parents handled discussing this with me, I only realize how very wise they were.</sentence><sentence id="540">For instance, both my parents said, look how lucky you are.</sentence><sentence id="541">You will be learning another language, you will be seeing new people.</sentence><sentence id="542">And they just made me feel like I was very special and very fortunate, so I believed that and -- and left quite happily, not realizing then that I would never see my parents again.</sentence><sentence id="543">And of course, I must add that we were all in hopes that we would be reunited in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="544">If that quota number had come through and had not been a war declared, eventually my parents would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>,</sentence><sentence id="546">4 and we would have joined them.</sentence><sentence id="547">And that was the fact with many of the other children who came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> like I did.</sentence><sentence id="548">I was not one of the fortunate ones.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1121">Q: Tell me more about them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1123">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="1124">Well, when I first ca-came to the <span class="BUILDING">Allen's house</span>, Mr. Allen was sick at the time, so he was bedridden with something, no-not on a permanent basis.</sentence><sentence id="1125">But he was a very patient and kind man, so I spent a lot of time at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedside</span>, and he would teach me English.</sentence><sentence id="1126">He would point to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and say <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>, I would say <span class="DLF">ceiling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1127">He would pa -- point to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and say <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, I'd say <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And I repeated everything that he said and then he would point again and see if I would remember it.</sentence><sentence id="1129">And I did fairly well.</sentence><sentence id="1130">Then he went t -- he asked me to bring his wallet, I brought his wallet.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And he took out all kinds of change.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And he said, this is a penny, that's a threepenny bit, that's a sixpence, that's a <span class="BUILDING">shilling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And so I said, a penny, a threepence -- I couldn't say threepence, that was very hard, because to put your tongue between your teeth to do a t-h, doesn't exist in German.</sentence><sentence id="1134">So I probably said tripence, but it's threepence, three pennies.</sentence><sentence id="1135">And sixpence, a <span class="BUILDING">shilling</span> and I think that's as high as it went.</sentence><sentence id="1136">When I had it all correct, he said I</sentence><sentence id="1138">8 could keep it, it's <span class="DLF">mine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1139">That I understood.</sentence><sentence id="1140">So I thought I was very rich, I now had all this change, which of course I wrote to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1141">I wrote, I have a penny, a threepence, sixpence, and a <span class="BUILDING">shilling</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1142">And my father, which I have in the first letter said, now that you are so rich, shall I send you the safe which we used to have?</sentence><sentence id="1143">You see, we no longer had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1144">He said, because you need to put all that money in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1145">So my father's good humor always came through.</sentence><sentence id="1146">But Mr. Allen was very, very kind and very patient, but he was a true businessman, very, very successful.</sentence><sentence id="1147">Hubert, the son, who was in his early 20's, was one who played cricket.</sentence><sentence id="1148">He had this cricket outfit, and at Christmastime would sing in the Christmas carols, there were all these young men, they were there.</sentence><sentence id="1149">They were all a lot older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="1150">But he was very, very nice and very kind to me.</sentence><sentence id="1151">He was already active in the business at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yelloway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1152">And Mrs. Allen was the typical English housewife.</sentence><sentence id="1153">When I look back on the times with Mrs. Allen, she was very spoiled, because she had everything done for her.</sentence><sentence id="1154">She had maid service all the time, she had a chauffeur just to take her around.</sentence><sentence id="1155">And she lived -- could live very graciously, but she had phobias.</sentence><sentence id="1156">She thought people were laughing at her.</sentence><sentence id="1157">I could not understand these things, because a youngster does not understand that.</sentence><sentence id="1158">But she was a very kind person, and as I said, they told me to call them Pop and Ma, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="1159">And Hubert, who was the big brother.</sentence><sentence id="1160">And I was very happy.</sentence><sentence id="1161">It became a new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="1162">By now the war was on one year, two years, and a ve -- at one time, after Mrs. Allen had been sick again and hospitalized, she got a shock me -- treatments, several times while I was there.</sentence><sentence id="1163">So they told me that they would send me away.</sentence><sentence id="1164">And I couldn't understand that.</sentence><sentence id="1165">They said, well we did not know that the war would go on so long, and we will always take care of you, and they gave me all these stories.</sentence><sentence id="1166">But I was extremely upset.</sentence><sentence id="1167">I think it was much more upset -- maybe more upsetting for me to leave the Allens, because it was a second, complete upheaval.</sentence><sentence id="1168">The first one I was well prepared for.</sentence><sentence id="1169">The -- leaving the Allens I was</sentence><sentence id="1171">9 not prepared for, and I didn't have that security behind me as having parents, real parents.</sentence><sentence id="1172">So they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>, which is in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1173"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> in the state of Kent.</sentence><sentence id="1174">And that was a -- don't remember the exact year, but probably 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1175">There was still a letter from my parents saying that I should not leave the Allens, please stay with the Allens, but this was beyond my control.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1231">Q: Did you talk to the Allens?</sentence><sentence id="1232">Did you tell them that you were unhappy?</sentence><sentence id="1233">Do you remember conversations at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1237">A: You know, this was like a fait accompli, they n -- this was it, I could not argue with anyone about anything, because they made the decisions.</sentence><sentence id="1238">They told me how much they loved me, and I have all kinds of letters from them, how much I meant to them, and they wanted to have a child of their own, but I would have to be of their religion and they fou -- noticed that they could never change my religion, I was probably too old and too strong for that already.</sentence><sentence id="1239">And eventually I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1243">Q: What was their religion?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1245">A: Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="1246"><span class="BUILDING">Church of England</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1249">Q: And can you tell me what -- what are both of their first names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1251">A: Margaret was Mrs. Allen, Margaret Allen, and Herbert Allen was Mr. Allen, and Hubert, the son.</sentence><sentence id="1252">Now, the son eventually got married, and I -- and has a d -- one daughter, and I am still in touch with the whole family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1255">Q: So you were probably with the Allens for at least a couple years, or what do you recall?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1257">A: Two to three -- two to three years, I don't know the date exactly, although in my diary it might record what date I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1258"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I presume</sentence><sentence id="1260">0 they made the arrangements through <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span>, because all the children who were refugee children were sponsored through <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1267">Q: So what age are you at about this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1269">A: By then I was 12.</sentence><sentence id="1270">12 to 13, maybe 13 when I got to <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1271">The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>, and The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> has been a very big part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="1272">Of course, I didn't realize that at the time, I was unhappy getting there, but then I suppose every other child who was there probably felt the same way about leaving their guardians.</sentence><sentence id="1273">Cause every child who was at The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beacon</span> had a guardian somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1274">And suddenly here we were, we found ourselves all together.</sentence><sentence id="1275">There must have been maybe 50 children or more, of different ages, who had all come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the kindertransport.</sentence><sentence id="1276">But now the war was in progress for a couple of years, and the guardians did not realize that they would have these children for so long, and sent them to this particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, called <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1277">They -- the children there were in age from approximately six to 16.</sentence><sentence id="1278">When I first got there I was a junior.</sentence><sentence id="1279">Later on we -- we became middles and then we became seniors, depending upon your age group.</sentence><sentence id="1280">And we shared one large <span class="INT_SPACE">dormitory room</span> together for at least 12 or more girls in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1281">And we got to know each other very, very well.</sentence><sentence id="1282">The same girls who were at The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> then are still my closest friends today.</sentence><sentence id="1283">Some of the girls stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when the war was over, and others went to different parts of the world.</sentence><sentence id="1284">A few were fortunate enough to be reunited with their parents.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Some knew that their parents were alive.</sentence><sentence id="1286">I was among those who were hoping that the parents were alive.</sentence><sentence id="1287">But, to no avail.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1307">Q: Do you think you stayed pretty optimistic throughout this time period of your life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1309">A: Yes, I believe so.</sentence><sentence id="1310">I think I have always had an optimistic nature, that's probably inherited.</sentence><sentence id="1311">But I don't think I ever thought about not seeing my parents.</sentence><sentence id="1312">I just presumed that when the war was</sentence><sentence id="1314">1 over, I'd find them somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1315">We did not know that they were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, not until several years after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1325">Q: So tell me about the physical surroundings.</sentence><sentence id="1326">What -- what was the -- set the scene a little bit at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1329">A: Well, The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> was an old <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> many, many years ago, and when I think about it from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I think of it as a huge, huge <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1330">When I went back there for a reunion after 50 years, it's not as big as I thought it was, it's just an average big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1331">But it was a gracious <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, and there was lots of laughter and lots of -- of good fun among the girls, although we lived under pretty meager conditions.</sentence><sentence id="1332">This was, after all, wartime.</sentence><sentence id="1333">Food was rationed, and we had a cook at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>, her name was Mrs. Hayward.</sentence><sentence id="1334">That name Hayward was important in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1335">Mrs. Hayward was the cook, and we had certain assignments to help.</sentence><sentence id="1336">To either peel potatoes or help with the dishwashing.</sentence><sentence id="1337">After all, there were many, many children there.</sentence><sentence id="1338">The food was mainly boiled fish, boiled cabbage and boiled potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="1339">So you weren't really hungry, because you could eat more potatoes, and you could eat more potatoes, but it was pretty awful.</sentence><sentence id="1340">I mean, it was very healthy food because everything was boiled.</sentence><sentence id="1341">They did not have fats.</sentence><sentence id="1342">You did not have oil, you didn't have butter.</sentence><sentence id="1343">These things were highly rationed during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1344">And we did not see fruit, but vegetables were growing in the <span class="REGION">area</span>, and there were beautiful, beautiful <span class="DLF">grounds</span> attached to The Beacon, with three what we called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span>, but they were really puddles.</sentence><sentence id="1345">What we thought was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>, we took an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedstead</span> and thought that was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1346">We paddled around in that.</sentence><sentence id="1347">We improvised with everything.</sentence><sentence id="1348">Occasionally clothes came from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1349">There would be a bunch of shoes, and you could try them on, and if a pair fitted you, they were yours.</sentence><sentence id="1350">So we had a lot of clothes like that.</sentence><sentence id="1351">Schooling was at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>, it was not too great.</sentence><sentence id="1352">Later on they sent us to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was called <span class="BUILDING">Holy Trinity</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1353">It was worse.</sentence><sentence id="1354">It was really not</sentence><sentence id="1356">2 a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="1357">I was able to take an exam for a special <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1358">Like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> we have <span class="BUILDING">Stuyvesant High School</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Bronx Science</span>, a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1359">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge</span>, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1360"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge</span> was maybe 10 miles away.</sentence><sentence id="1361">I passed the test, but then they -- the government said I was not a British subject is what they called it, so I was not able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but continued at <span class="BUILDING">Holy Trinity</span>, which was not much of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1362">But I read a lot and eventually, at the age of 16, I was still there, we all had to choose a career of some sort.</sentence><sentence id="1363">Most of the girls went in for <span class="BUILDING">nursing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1364">And I said no, I didn't want to be a nurse.</sentence><sentence id="1365">And how about a <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1366">I said no, I didn't think I would like that.</sentence><sentence id="1367">They said, well what would I like to study?</sentence><sentence id="1368">So I said art.</sentence><sentence id="1369">So I di -- took some kind of art exam, probably drawing something very basic, and I was able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1370">So I went to the school of <span class="BUILDING">arts and crafts</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>, and loved it.</sentence><sentence id="1371">We drew from the skeleton, and Michelangelo, and nude figures.</sentence><sentence id="1372">And I think I did quite well, but one of the ladies from the committee who took care of The Beacon girls said, you have to learn a profession where you can earn money.</sentence><sentence id="1373">I hadn't really considered that, seriously.</sentence><sentence id="1374">So they told me that I should concentrate on dress design and dressmaking, and they did teach that at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, at the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1375">So I learned how to draw dresses and how to make patterns, very basic patterns.</sentence><sentence id="1376">And I took an exam while at the school of arts and crafts for the [indecipherable] of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and I got a degree in fashion at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1377">I was still very young, and enjoyed doing that.</sentence><sentence id="1378">However, after about two years at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, they said you now have to take a job and earn money.</sentence><sentence id="1379">And that's rather difficult in the <span class="DLF">fashion field</span>, especially when you have no background.</sentence><sentence id="1380">So one of the ladies from the committee of <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> had dresses made at a very fancy <span class="BUILDING">couturier shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1381">So I had -- they told me I would have a -- get a job at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1382">And my</sentence><sentence id="1384">3 brother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> by that time, so that was a very good thing for both of us, because that -- from that time on, my brother and I were always in touch, I think we saw each other daily.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1445">Q: Now, just to go back, when you arrived to <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>, were most of the other girls at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1447">A: All the children were Jewish, all the children were refugee children like myself, and they all had different stories to tell.</sentence><sentence id="1448">Some were with very good guardians and some were not.</sentence><sentence id="1449">So we -- we knew all about each other, we were like a group of sisters, and I would say we still are.</sentence><sentence id="1450">Half of them now live in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and ha -- maybe half in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and a few are in different parts of the world.</sentence><sentence id="1451">But th -- all the children had a similar background.</sentence><sentence id="1452">Now, the interesting part is that I had a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, her name at The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> was Sylvia Balbera.</sentence><sentence id="1453">Her married name was Schneider, Sylvia Schneider.</sentence><sentence id="1454">And she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> until last year, she passed away.</sentence><sentence id="1455">If you asked Sylvia about the years at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>, she would give you a completely different story about how dreadful it was, not only the food, but the way we were dressed, and that nobody loved us, and nobody cared.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And yet, I look at the same years as saying they were productive.</sentence><sentence id="1457">They made us realize what is important in life and what is not so important in life.</sentence><sentence id="1458">Cause we had next to nothing, and yet we had each other.</sentence><sentence id="1459">I think it taught us a great deal about the values of what is important and what isn't important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1473">Q: Did you also feel more comfortable being around Jewish friends again?</sentence><sentence id="1474">Did that make a difference to you at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1477">A: I think it gave all of us a certain comfort knowing, for instance, on a Friday night we could have prayers over the bread and wine, and basic things that I remembered from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I think I was pretty much the leader.</sentence><sentence id="1479">They said I was very much of a leader type person.</sentence><sentence id="1480">When the s-</sentence><sentence id="1482">4 superior there said that to me, I didn't know what she was talking about, but in life she was actually quite correct.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1491">Q: So, while you were at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>, what did you have to -- you -- you started to talk about how you eventually learned you needed to make money, but while you were still studying at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span>, what -- how were you taken care of in terms of money?</sentence><sentence id="1492">Were the Allens sending you money, and -- and what did you need in those days in terms of money?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1495">A: I don't remember receiving money from the Allens, although I visited them, I would say, about twice a year.</sentence><sentence id="1496">I would go to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- you had to get pol -- permission from the police department that you were leaving your <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>, since we were known as enemy aliens all during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1497">All the children were enemy aliens, cause we were not British subjects.</sentence><sentence id="1498">But that was not difficult, to get the permit to go.</sentence><sentence id="1499">So I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> I would get on one of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span>, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And most of the drivers knew me from the time I was a little girl.</sentence><sentence id="1501">So I did visit the Allens on a somewhat regular basis, and they always wrote to me.</sentence><sentence id="1502">But now The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beacon</span> really was our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1503">The one thing I need to mention is that when I was told that I need to have a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, Mrs. Hayward, who was the cook, had her son and daughter-in-law as visitors most weekends.</sentence><sentence id="1504">And they came there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> with a young couple, to stay with her because there was a lot of bombing going on.</sentence><sentence id="1505">This was the height of the war, and the doodlebugs, which are one kind of bomb, would come over the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span>, and they had <span class="BUILDING">balloon barrages</span> up to prevent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> from reaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1506">However, this couple, Hayward, Alec Hayward -- Alec Hayward, right, and Agnes, would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> most weekends.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And Alec was an artist.</sentence><sentence id="1508">So he and I would do some sketching together.</sentence><sentence id="1509">We would draw The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span>, or we would draw a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>, or whatever, and I got to know this couple</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1512">5 quite well.</sentence><sentence id="1513">So Mr. Hayward, this is the young Mr. Hayward, said to me, where are you going to live when you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1514">And I said I don't know yet.</sentence><sentence id="1515">I did not know.</sentence><sentence id="1516">So he said, well if you would like, you can live with us because we have a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Wickham</span>, which is just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and we have an extra <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>, and if you like you can stay with us.</sentence><sentence id="1517">And that is what I did, I then lived with the Haywards in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1518">I did not make enough money to pay for the train fare, and I paid a little bit to the Haywards for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board, it wasn't very much.</sentence><sentence id="1519">But the <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> helped out at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1520">So <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> paid the ou -- the Haywards something towards my keep.</sentence><sentence id="1521">And I earned 35 shillings at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span>, and I learned the dress trade from the bottom up.</sentence><sentence id="1522">I started by picking up the pins off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with a magnet, and then they let me put in some basting threads, and take out basting threads.</sentence><sentence id="1523">I was allowed to do little things, but gradually I learned more and more.</sentence><sentence id="1524">And in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> one learned a profession by being an apprentice.</sentence><sentence id="1525">It's not necessarily a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1526">At the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I had learned the

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2231">A: Well, the English and German is not a problem for me because both languages are identical.</sentence><sentence id="2232">I have no problems speaking either one, but emotionally it brings back things that I'd just as soon not think about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2235">Q: Do you think that's helped you in a way, not to dwell on the memories, the bad -- the -- the difficult memories?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2237">A: I believe so.</sentence><sentence id="2238">I don't believe in <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> on difficult or bad times.</sentence><sentence id="2239">I would rather think about the positive, but that's the way I am, it's the -- my nature.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2243">Q: And what about with your children?</sentence><sentence id="2244">Did you talk much about your experiences as a youngster with your children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2247">A: No, didn't talk about it at all.</sentence><sentence id="2248">Our children were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2249">We lived in a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Middle Village</span>, and they grew up with all the other neighborhood American children.</sentence><sentence id="2250">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in -- in the <span class="DLF">park</span>, very close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2251">And actually the conversation never came up, even though my husband and I both speak German fluently, we really did not use</sentence><sentence id="2253">5 the German language.</sentence><sentence id="2254">My husband was also born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gettingen</span>, but at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we just spoke English, with one exception.</sentence><sentence id="2255">When Jerry's mother, my husband's mother came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war and I met her, she didn't speak English, she would speak German.</sentence><sentence id="2256">And I always understood it, but I hadn't used the language for so many years in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2257">So she would say well, why don't you answer me in German?</sentence><sentence id="2258">And I really hesitated to speak German, but the more she insisted and the more she spoke German, I understood everything, and eventually I would speak to her, so the children would hear a little German here and there, when -- you know, when the grandmother came to visit, which was every weekend.</sentence><sentence id="2259">But my husband and I only speak English at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2260">But a ga -- regarding whether we spoke about our childhood and kindertransport, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2261">I don't think the children were even aware of any of this, except that we visited the Allens with the children when they were about five and six years old, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and visited the Allens, who were, of course, very, very proud to have me back and to see our children, and they were very, very kind to us.</sentence><sentence id="2262">And at one time they came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and visited us in our little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Middle Village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2263">So there was always this connection, and I told you that I am still in touch with the granddaughter, very much so.</sentence><sentence id="2264">And just a year ago the granddaughter, with her seven children, came to visit our son in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span>, and then to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2265">So it's like part of my life is definitely in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2287">Q: Why do you think you didn't talk much about this, or at all, with your own children?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2289">A: I don't know that it was deliberate, except for the fact that I wanted the children to have a very happy childhood, and I didn't believe in burdening them with anything that was an unpleasant past.</sentence><sentence id="2290">But the time did come when they started posing questions.</sentence><sentence id="2291">And the first question I remember, the boys are only 14 months apart in age, one of them saying at Thanksgiving time, they were now in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, saying, everybody is going to their grandmother's and</sentence><sentence id="2293">6 <span class="BUILDING">grandfather's house</span>, why don't we have grandparents?</sentence><sentence id="2294">So now the question came from the children, and I told them in short that there was this bad man in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and because of that I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and I said, you know, Pop and Ma in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and of course they did, because they had visited and they knew them very well by now.</sentence><sentence id="2295">And I said, well that's why I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2296">But I would make it very short, I never dwelt on it, and neither did my husband.</sentence><sentence id="2297">It was just, when they asked a question they got a real answer, but we never talked much about politics, we just wanted them to have a happy childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2309">Q: So now if you would tell me about what happened with the other items, this sort of surprise phone call that you received, other items that wound up being -- belonging to your family, and that you didn't even know about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2311">A: All right.</sentence><sentence id="2312">Well, it's just a -- a little over a year ago, in 2005, and we're now in 2006, I received a phone call from this woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, Jutta Dick at the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span>, and she said, "Lilly, I had a phone call from somebody called Horst Hesser, do you know Horst Hesser?"</sentence><sentence id="2313">And I said, no, I don't.</sentence><sentence id="2314">She said, "Do you know Horst?"</sentence><sentence id="2315">So I thought about it, and I said, "Well the only Horst I know is the doll I had.</sentence><sentence id="2316">My little doll I played with in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a boy doll, and his name was Horst."</sentence><sentence id="2317">I said, "That's the only Horst I know."</sentence><sentence id="2318">But I must have called that Horst after -- that doll after somebody, somebody I liked, but I couldn't remember.</sentence><sentence id="2319">She said, "Well, Horst Hesser is trying to reach you, and he says he has some items that belong to you."</sentence><sentence id="2320">I said, "No, that can't be, I -- I just don't know anybody."</sentence><sentence id="2321">So she said, "Well, he said he has certain belongings from your parents and he has looked for you all his life, and he just found you through the internet, through the computer."</sentence><sentence id="2322">Well, apparently Horst Hesser has a son-in-law and he is very creative with the computer and Horst has said to him at various times, could you put in the name of either Vanna Cohn or Lilly Cohn and see what happens.</sentence><sentence id="2323">And</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2326">7 over the years, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And Horst said that when he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, he would always ask, what happened to that family, Cohn, and anyone he would ask would say, we don't know, or we'd rather not talk about that.</sentence><sentence id="2328">So this time this son-in-law put in the name Lilly Cohn, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, and it came out that it said, Lilly Cohn, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> is now Lillyan Rosenberg, tour guide in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2329">So he was extremely excited and went to see his father-in-law and told him, I think I found her.</sentence><sentence id="2330">So one thing led to another, they contacted the guide association in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and said, do you know Lillyan Rosenberg?</sentence><sentence id="2331">And they said, oh sure we do, because of course, they speak different languages and I did tours in German.</sentence><sentence id="2332">They said she was president of the multilingual guide association.</sentence><sentence id="2333">He said, well how can we reach her?</sentence><sentence id="2334">So they told him how they could reach me, and that is how Horst called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and she told me to get in touch with Horst.</sentence><sentence id="2335">So now I called him, and one f -- morning I called, and of course my German is fluent, and I said to him, "Here is Lilly Cohn."</sentence><sentence id="2336">And he said, "Are you the little girl I played with?"</sentence><sentence id="2337">I said, "I don't know, I can't remember."</sentence><sentence id="2338">He said, "Well, if you are the one," he said, "our parents were very good friends and they used to have coffee and cake at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and you and I would play under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and do some crayoning or play."</sentence><sentence id="2339">I must have been all of seven years old at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2340">And sh -- he said, "While I am speaking to you, I have paintings in front of me, and these paintings were done by your mother, and they have your mother's signature."</sentence><sentence id="2341">And so I said, "That can't be."</sentence><sentence id="2342">He said, "Yes, I have several items from your parents."</sentence><sentence id="2343">And he told me that his father and my father were doing business together.</sentence><sentence id="2344">So I believe that after my father's <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed, he still sold linens by going to <span class="BUILDING">people's houses</span>, or business, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2345">But with a suitcase I remember him getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and that was after the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed, before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2346">So apparently he knew this family well.</sentence><sentence id="2347">So ma -- now --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2348">Q: And where -- and where were they, where did they live?</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2353">A: They now live in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwerin</span>, but at the time, his father and my parents lived like 10 miles apart.</sentence><sentence id="2354">He -- the father of Horst and family, they lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, a real farm country.</sentence><sentence id="2355">Like we have Pennsylvania Dutch, real <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2356">There'd be one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here, and a half a mile away, another <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2357">That's how his parents lived.</sentence><sentence id="2358">So apparently, during the war, my father said to Horst's father, would you come and get some of our precious belongings in case we ever have to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and would you hold them for safekeeping?</sentence><sentence id="2359">So apparently, Horst's father, at great risk to his own life, came in the middle of the night with, I think a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, and took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and carpeting and silver and paintings, a s -- little statue, and various items from my <span class="BUILDING">parent's home</span>, and he drove them during the night because nobody would see him where they live, and he hid them in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2360">So these items were hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> all the war years.</sentence><sentence id="2361">And of course, eventually, my parents had to leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, their ho -- our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2362">And after the war, Horst's father said to his two sons, who were now teenagers, "We have belongings from a Jewish family, the family Cohn, and I'm trying to find them, and if I don't find them, I want you to promise me that you will always look for them, and we have to return these items to that family."</sentence><sentence id="2363">So I couldn't believe what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="2364">But it was just a year ago in July that we made arrangements then to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and that Horst and his wife would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, and then my husband was coming with me, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2365">And the two sons said, "Well then, we'll go too, because if you're going, we'll go."</sentence><sentence id="2366">And the three grandchildren said, "Well if you're all going, we want to go, too."</sentence><sentence id="2367">So on July of nine -- of 2 - "05, we all arranged to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2368">So it was the two sons, one daughter-in-law, and the three grandchildren and my husband and I, we all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and we met Horst and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="2369">They are also in their 70's, like I am, but he's a little bit older, and they're a very charming couple.</sentence><sentence id="2370">And we spent a few days with them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2371">And there were great festivities, if</sentence><sentence id="2373">9 one may call it that, because there was the press, and television and newscasters, all at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> where this took place.</sentence><sentence id="2374">And some students, and outsiders.</sentence><sentence id="2375">It got a tremendous lot of publicity and Horst returned the paintings to me, and a whole set of silverware with the initial C for Cohn, and a little statue.</sentence><sentence id="2376">It took quite awhile, but eventually it reached our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and we are now blessed to have the paintings and the silver and the statue in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2402">Q: I want to ask you first of all, when's the first time you ever went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war?</sentence><sentence id="2403">Tell me a little bit about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2406">A: Well, I was once in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when I was working at the German national tourist office, and I acco-companied American tourists to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I was more or less the interpreter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2408">Q: And when was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2410">A: In 19 -- approximately 1974.</sentence><sentence id="2411">I worked at the ger -- <span class="BUILDING">German tourist office</span> for five years and gave advice to American travel agents and tourists who were thinking of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2412">Of course, I don't remember <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as such, I only know the map, and I studied that.</sentence><sentence id="2413">But eventually I had to take American travel agents to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and I would have a local tour guide over there explaining things to me in German, and I in turn interpreted it into English.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2418">Q: So tell me, how did it feel the first time you were back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, how did that feel?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2420">A: I decided that I will think of it as if | was in <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>, because it was all strange to me anyway, and I did not like the idea of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and on my own, I would not have gone.</sentence><sentence id="2421">But that was business, and I did what I had to do, and it was successful.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2424">Q: Did you feel uncomfortable around Germans, especially if they were of a certain age, old enough to have been active during that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2426">A: At times very much so, because -- , Side A</sentence><sentence id="2428">0 Beginning Tape Three, Side B</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2432">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg.</sentence><sentence id="2433">This is tape number three, side B. So you were telling me about your interaction with every day Germans, I guess whether that first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, or tourists who came here and any of the discomfort that you may have felt in the earliest times that you can recall?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2436">A: I did not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> voluntarily, but since it was part of my job, I decided that if I didn't do it, somebody else would be doing it.</sentence><sentence id="2437">And we visited a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and my question was to the guide who showed us around, who was wearing a yarmulke, you know, skullcap, a-are there any Jews who ever come here?</sentence><sentence id="2438">And he said no, there were no Jews who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span>, but they built a token <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> like a goodwill, restitution thing.</sentence><sentence id="2439">But the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is used at times by American soldiers who are stationed in the vicinity.</sentence><sentence id="2440">So it was used there, but otherwise there were no Jews who came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span>, which was a very active Jewish community before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2446">Q: So that was your trip in the 70's, is that right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2448">A: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2450">Q: And then you were starting to tell me about perhaps feeling uncomfortable, even German tourists -- did it make you uncomfortable sometimes to meet Germans who you wondered about what they had done during the war time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2452">A: Well, very often they would ask me political questions.</sentence><sentence id="2453">Now that I was dealing with them -- with German tourists in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2454">But I -- I would turn that around very quickly by saying, my job is to tell you about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I want to tell you about the <span class="BUILDING">Empire State building</span>, or the <span class="BUILDING">Chrysler building</span>, or whatever, and I never really went into my background.</sentence><sentence id="2455">It was only once, when German tourists introduced themselves on one of my longer tours, where I have people</sentence><sentence id="2457">1 coming up to the mic, and they say, I was a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, and the other one says, oh I'm also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, so they got to know each other.</sentence><sentence id="2458">And this one woman said she's from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2459">So that took me by surprise, and I didn't know just how to handle that.</sentence><sentence id="2460">And I did not tell her that I was born there until the last day when I took them to <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2461">I decided on my way there that I would dec -- would tell her about it.</sentence><sentence id="2462">And I asked her what kind of work they were doing, and she said, we made uniforms in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2463">So I wasn't too happy, and I did not want that to be the conversation on the whole tour, because I'm dealing with Germans, and Australians, or Austrians and English, they could all be in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, but I really didn't want to have that as a conversation piece.</sentence><sentence id="2464">So in general I avoided having these kind of conversations.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2480">Q: Now when's the next time you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and what were the circumstances of that journey?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2482">A: We got this letter from Jutta Dick from the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, saying we would like to invite you to come over to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and this was approximately year 2000, approximately.</sentence><sentence id="2483">And she said, would we be willing to address some of the students of the vicinity, and it was mainly because of the diary I kept, because I sent a copy of the diary, I think it's about 66 pages, I sent a copy to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>, because they're trying to show what life was like in that community.</sentence><sentence id="2484">And that tagabu, this diary of mine, which I have right here, became a textbook for the students in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2485">And they studied my background and the way of life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2486">So she asked if I would address students and come over there and s -- that they could a -- meet somebody and speak to me directly.</sentence><sentence id="2487">So my friend Ruth Oppenheimer, who I mentioned before, and her husband, and my husband Jerry and I, and one lady from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, her naveda -- name is Judith Beerun, and she goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> fr -- quite frequently from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, she is older than I am.</sentence><sentence id="2488">We were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> together, and we</sentence><sentence id="2490">2 had interviews, mostly at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and sometimes at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where students of a -- an age about 16 to 20 -- not the youn -- very youngest, could ask questions, anything they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2491">And being that my German is quite fluent, they -- they would speak to me and give -- and I would answer their questions.</sentence><sentence id="2492">I also offered them that if they had any questions that they could write to me and I would answer their letters, which indeed I did.</sentence><sentence id="2493">One of the letters which is outstanding in my mind is where a young student wrote to me, of course all in German, I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and wherever I go in the world, wherever my parents and I travel, people always refer to us as Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="2494">What can I do about it?</sentence><sentence id="2495">After all, I wasn't even born.</sentence><sentence id="2496">What can I help what my grandfather may have done, and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="2497">So I gave it quite a bit of thought how to answer such a letter.</sentence><sentence id="2498">And I wrote back and I answered every letter, but this came up in several versions.</sentence><sentence id="2499">And I said, you know, you are not responsible for things that happened before you were born.</sentence><sentence id="2500">But you're very responsible for all the decisions you make in your lifetime.</sentence><sentence id="2501">And therefore, all I can tell you is that you do not have to feel guilty for things that happened before your time, but be very sure that whatever decisions you make in your life will be the right decision, and not only because of the majority doing it.</sentence><sentence id="2502">So I ho-hope that I gave the youngsters the proper advice.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2526">Q: Did you feel -- on these trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, did you feel a certain inevitable resentment toward Germans, toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2528">A: I must carry on for what I just said.</sentence><sentence id="2529">I feel that the young people are not responsible for that which happened before their time.</sentence><sentence id="2530">I look at the old people in a different way.</sentence><sentence id="2531">And yet I feel life must go on, and we must be positive.</sentence><sentence id="2532">I cannot say that one can ever forget the type of childhood that I had because of the loss of my parents.</sentence><sentence id="2533">I cannot forgive them for that, but I cannot hold it against all the Germans, because I think they're doing the best they can to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and I have found many, many positive things, including some very, very good people, including this Horst</sentence><sentence id="2535">3 and his wife.</sentence><sentence id="2536">They had, for instance, the various pieces of silver for my parents, which my parents might have hidden somewhere, I don't know, and that was distributed among the various members of the family.</sentence><sentence id="2537">And yet when they heard that we were coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they all gave it back and we have all these things from all the various members.</sentence><sentence id="2538">So there are many good people, and we have to realize that and go ahead.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2551">Q: What about Horst himself?</sentence><sentence id="2552">During the war time, was he of age to be in the German army?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2830">Q: Okay, and let me see if I have any other questions to ask?</sentence><sentence id="2831">Did you keep this baby doll that's named after Horst?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2834">A: No, unfortunately I only have the picture of the doll called Horst.</sentence><sentence id="2835">And one of the newspapers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> put the title, a doll called Horst, and had two full pages on the story of the reunion with Horst and myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2840">A: I look at that as though my life, which I didn't think was so -- so unusual, because when I have a -- neighbors here, and they say, oh you have such an interesting life, and I'd say where</sentence><sentence id="2842">0 were you from?</sentence><sentence id="2843"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2844">I'd say, I wish I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2845">I don't want such an interesting life.</sentence><sentence id="2846">But now that it is the way it is, I would like it to be a contribution to history, so that no one will ever doubt what has happened to children like myself.</sentence><sentence id="2847">And on a positive vein, I would say that of all the people I know who have grown up under very difficult conditions and I s -- look at their family and their children, they have all done a very good job with their sons and daughters, and most of them are professionals and doing very, very well.</sentence><sentence id="2848">So I believe we've been able to teach them very good values.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2862">A: Yes, I believe so, even though I think children of kindertransport parents feel that they are overly protected.</sentence><sentence id="2863">That is a complaint we get from all the children.</sentence><sentence id="2864">They will say my mother wants to know where I am, my father wants to know where I am, they're always keeping tabs on us.</sentence><sentence id="2865">That might be some of our insecurity of people like myself.</sentence><sentence id="2866">But when I watch my children, who now have teenage children, they're doing the same thing with theirs -- children, they're bringing them up the same way, and I must say I'm glad about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
