night, you know.</sentence><sentence id="305">It was no light was allowed during wartime.</sentence><sentence id="306">Otherwise the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming for surveillance or bombing, they could pinpoint the <span class="REGION">area</span> easier.</sentence><sentence id="307">So, it had to be always dark, darkness.</sentence><sentence id="308">So on a certain date we dug under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> and during the night we slipped out under the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and they were waiting for us with pistols.</sentence><sentence id="309">And they used to -- they gave us a pistol and a couple of rounds, couple of magazines of bullets, rounds.</sentence><sentence id="310">And they told us that anybody wants to ask for identification, shoot them right away.</sentence><sentence id="311">Had to shoot them, otherwise they'd shoot you.</sentence><sentence id="312">Because as a Jew -- they what they did is, when they asked for identification from you, and they wasn't satisfied with it, they used to take you under the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and you had to show your penis.</sentence><sentence id="313">It was only Jews, they were they were circumcised in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="314">So if they showed, they show you your penis they'll shoot you right on the spot, so we had to shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="315">That was an order, to shoot them.</sentence><sentence id="316">And again we got into the this safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, you know, when the this underground fighters they gave us directions you know which way to go and how to get there.</sentence><sentence id="317">We were a little familiar with the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">We got there so the our command--- the commandant, you know, the commandant, he was he was he was 22 years old you know, but he spoke fluent German so he was questioning us, you know, if he want to be sure you know, we're Jew, we're Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="319">And we had to show him our penis, you know, we are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="320">In a couple of days he was crash training -- how to use small arms, fire arms and machine guns and grenades, how to throw effectively and in after two days we went to our first job.</sentence><sentence id="321">So there were about 15 of us.</sentence><sentence id="322">So I asked him, where we asked the lieutenant -- we used to call him lieutenant, he was 22 years.</sentence><sentence id="323">His name was Laci, Leslie you know in English.</sentence><sentence id="324">So he said, "You'll find out where we're going.</sentence><sentence id="325">So, first we had to steal a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>."</sentence><sentence id="326">A couple of boys knew how to drive, so they saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we used to follow each other about 50 feet, you know, not to be suspicious you know during the -- it was dark, very dark.</sentence><sentence id="327">So they find the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">They put the, cross the <span class="DLF">wires</span>, and off we went outskirts to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> is two -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Danube</span> divides

id="332">So, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span>, the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="333">So, finally we had a discussion that says we're going into this <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span>, but it was circled and was pro-protected with the Hungarian patrol.</sentence><sentence id="334">So, he went there by himself alone.</sentence><sentence id="335">He was dressed as a Hungarian officer uniform.</sentence><sentence id="336">He spoke fluent German and Hungarian, of course.</sentence><sentence id="337">He was asking for the -- he was asking direction.</sentence><sentence id="338">So, we park that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, you know, for a short distance from this <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span>.</sentence><sentence id="339">Two guys, both <span class="NPIP">side</span>, two, always two of us one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and two on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">Two patrols.</sentence><sentence id="341">We grabbed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span>.</sentence><sentence id="342">We was told what to do you know before.</sentence><sentence id="343">Close his mouth with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bayonet</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="344">We had to stab him that many times and this has to be repeated about two, three times before we got into the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span>, dump, <span class="DLF">dump site</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">So there we gathered all we could -- the most important thing was <span class="DLF">mine</span> -- to get <span class="DLF">mines</span> to -- because our purpose was to delay their supplies and sabotage their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>, you know, the supply.</sentence><sentence id="346">So we got as many, much heavy machine guns can and grenades and <span class="DLF">mines</span>, as much as we could carry, you know, 15 people.</sentence><sentence id="347">And we loaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> -- we loaded -- got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> loaded and about two sappers stayed behind to, you know what a sapper is.</sentence><sentence id="348">They put four, five different <span class="NPIP">places</span> but mines in into the <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> in a few minutes.</sentence><sentence id="349">Didn't go more than 500 yards.</sentence><sentence id="350">We saw the like a fires -- what do you call it -- blaze, you know.</sentence><sentence id="351">It was like we destroyed the <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> you know, when it were up.</sentence><sentence id="352">They were searching for us all over you know.</sentence><sentence id="353">And they were going to spy, disperse the personnel, you know.</sentence><sentence id="354">They had to hide.</sentence><sentence id="355">The <span class="DLF">mine</span> was the most important thing we have to go in during the evening at night to mine the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> and <span class="DLF">bridges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">So, but they start to repairing it you know, the faster and faster, the because they had no more men than we were, you know, the army, you know, the Hungarian army and German collaborators.</sentence><sentence id="357">So it was, it was -- I remember the date -- was it September, September 1944, and Horthy,(r) I told you that Horthy Miklos -- he was chancellor already in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and this visit came out from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> on a false pretense and this Jew-hater Szalasi, he took over the reign, and he was a well-known Jew-hater.</sentence><sentence id="358">He was worse than Horthy Mikles, but when he spirited Horthy Mikles out they called him he was he was a Jewish collaborator already, Horthy Mikles.</sentence><sentence id="359">Besides they call him anything else.</sentence><sentence id="360">So in March, in September seven -- 17, we heard on the radio that they going to make a big parade, when they took over the reign from Horthy, on <span class="DLF">Vilmos csaszar street</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">So we had the order from the American and British intelligence, because we worked for them because that's the underground fighter -- they told us that we actually worked for the British-American

class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">We, the night before we placed heavy machine gun and all kind of fire equipment, you know, with submachine gun and grenades and you name it.</sentence><sentence id="366">We had it.</sentence><sentence id="367">Pistols, were 200 of us.</sentence><sentence id="368">Two hundred people, you know, could do a lot of lot of damage.</sentence><sentence id="369">I remember the waiting in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>, wherever we were stationed.</sentence><sentence id="370">And we heard the column.</sentence><sentence id="371">The column was coming and saw the cheering of the Christians well wishers, you know, with the fascist flags.</sentence><sentence
