of <span class="REGION">White Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">So we were, we're now only with our father and we were separated from our second mother and it was just terrible, but our whole life was up-side-down, from this time, because when the Russian came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie</span>, you know, the first thing what they did, they said that my father is a rich man.</sentence><sentence id="74">They called him bourgeois and they didn't give him a passport and he was now like an enemy of the people.</sentence><sentence id="75">Even he, he didn't do anything to..., he was working very hard to be an owner, he was considered persona-nongratta(ph) and | couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solie</span> because there was no <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and | just started go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, so | was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dushanitover(ph</span>) was the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and my father rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there and | attended this <span

complete division, my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, my beloved <span class="BUILDING">school</span>...the</sentence><sentence id="81">children couldn't go there because they had to learn Lithuanian and some of them went to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">It was a big, big, upheaval in our young life.</sentence><sentence id="83">So when | came back, | was heartbroken because everything that was dear to me was kind of destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="84">But, then came June, 1941...this was when the German army came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but before they came, | wanted to tell you that my father was thrown out from, by the Russian, from the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, and he was made a manager in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astroegetts(ph</span>), so they had to move there.</sentence><sentence id="85">And, of course, he was very disappointed, but he was trying to do his best and he became very friendly with a young doctor that was living just near us, and this was actually in his only companion because the cultural level of the town people were very low.</sentence><sentence id="86">So here | am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astroegetts(ph</span>), | just came for vacation, it was June, and I'm sitting and reading a

saying "Your father wants you right away, the German invaded and they are coming to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>."</sentence><sentence id="88">We were strangers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Astorgetts(ph)</span>...we just couldn't make friends in such a short time so we didn't have, like, roots there.</sentence><sentence id="89">When | cam running, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> standing with Russian doctors and Russian nurses who were good friends of my father and they asked my father we should go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they will take us to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">And, my father took me and my sister into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and said, "My children, during the war, a person has to have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over their head, a <span class="DLF">roof</span> is very important.</sentence><sentence id="91">| know the German invited us when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and some how they were even so | don't believe that they will do any harm to me, after all, | am a law-abiding person and | am professional."</sentence><sentence id="92">So, we were standing there...as soon as the Russian left, in a few more hours, the maid of the young doctor, there was a friend of my father came running up and said that the doctor told me to tell you there will be a program (you know what is a program) tonight and since you are the most prominential in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you will be the first one.</sentence><sentence id="93">So he said, "Leave everything and go someplace, because you will be killed."</sentence><sentence id="94">There was a rabbi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so my father went to the rabbi and told him and the rabbi said, "Okay, you stay here."</sentence><sentence id="95">And, low and behold, this night was a very big program...we heard it.</sentence><sentence id="96">There were peasant(ph) with those big things that you clean the <span class="DLF">street</span>, | forgot how

didn't come to the Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="140">| don't what was, but it was luck.</sentence><sentence id="141">So, the next day, in the morning, we came out and we went to our <span

tape one, side B.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: Still today, | don't know if it was staged, that he wanted to rob us, this Pole, or it was just, just one of those things that the peasants were wild and they were, they just attacked him.</sentence><sentence id="148">So there | was sitting and I, when | saw my father all bloody and there is, there are no word that | can describe you, but | was very concerned because my little sister became very hysterical and she couldn't cry because we had to be very quiet.</sentence><sentence id="149">Our life was in danger.</sentence><sentence id="150">So we left everything that we had there, all our goods, and we went again to the Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="151">And in the morning, somehow, my father contacted a peasant and gave him a sum of money and he, asked him to take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> to my aunt.</sentence><sentence id="152">After my father came with this, all bleeding, something happened to my dog, Rex.</sentence><sentence id="153">He was so attached to us, he was like a member of my family.</sentence><sentence id="154">When my mother passed away, he was sitting there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because in Europe you didn't put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">funeral home</span>, it was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, so he was sitting and he went, and he was howling, it was a terrible howl, but there was no way that he would move from my mother's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">He was sitting together with me and | spent the night with him there.</sentence><sentence id="156">When there was the funeral, he wanted to go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">funeral cortege</span> and he became wild when they had to subdue him and put him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">He was very much attached to us.</sentence><sentence id="158">When my father came and all bloody, something happened to this dog and he, had like a paralysis and his head turned to the side.</sentence><sentence id="159">And my father took him out to a <span class="DLF">field</span> and asked somebody to shoot him.</sentence><sentence id="160">And it was like an end of an era.</sentence><sentence id="161">Because this dog was like, everything what was good and carefree and pink and colorful in our childhood.</sentence><sentence id="162">So next day, we got up very, very early in the morning and this peasant took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> of hide, and put us there, camouflaged us and we had like babushkas(ph), and he took us, after a few hours, we came very early in the</sentence><sentence id="164">morning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">And he left us in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that | was not even familiar where, how where.</sentence><sentence id="166">And | also didn't know that there was then a curfew of Jews, that the Jews could just walk a certain hours, and the Jews had to have yellow, a star, this, Stars of David, and they also had to walk in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">So it took us a few hours and | was walking with my sister on the <span class="DLF">street</span> like two little Polish girls.</sentence><sentence id="168">And when my aunt saw us, she thought that we came from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, who know what.</sentence><sentence id="169">Of course, she was very, very happy and we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">A few days later, my father came.</sentence><sentence id="171">And my father, from all the aggravation of everything, became ill and had a very big abscess.</sentence><sentence id="172">And also, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, the Jews were persecuted like subhumans.</sentence><sentence id="173">Every day, new edicts were coming.</sentence><sentence id="174">We couldn't have a radio, we couldn't have a jewelry, we couldn't have a watch, we couldn't have properties, we couldn't talk to gentiles.</sentence><sentence id="175">| mean, we were plain ostracizes.</sentence><sentence id="176">And every day they used to come and take out men and young boys and they used to disappear and the women never knew where they were and what was done to these young .</sentence><sentence id="177">One of my uncles, my mother's sister's husband, was taken from the <span class="DLF">street</span>, he was standing and reading an edict, he was taken from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she never saw him again.</sentence><sentence id="178">So the situation was very, very tense and my father was very ill and he was afraid to go out in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">But once he became so ill and the abscess that he had was so big that during the night, he decided that he had to go, so my uncle and my aunt took him by the hand and they were walking in the middle of the night, they took him to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span>, it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And he was staying there.</sentence><sentence id="181">And my other uncle no, never went out.</sentence><sentence id="182">And when the Gestapo used to come and ask if there are men there, she used to come out and, luckily, they would look in a few <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and my, he was camouflaged, something, so my uncle was never found.</sentence><sentence id="183">So it was, until, until, | don't remember exactly the date, | think it was June 6, 19, no, no, no, September 6, 1941, that an edict came that all the Jews have to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">But it was such a diabolic, diabolic plan, a master plan, the way they did it.</sentence><sentence id="185">There was, as | told you, there was a section, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> in the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>, a very, very <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cultural town</span> that had a lot of <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span>, archives and <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and it had, and Jewish, very rich Jewish life with <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> and all kinds of societies and charitable organization.</sentence><sentence id="186">And there were a lot of Jewish doctors that had a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">And also, there were a lot of facilities for poor Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="188">In the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> was a section where very poor Jews lived, it was in very bad conditions.</sentence><sentence id="189">The German came there in the middle of the night, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, told all those Jews to walk out, put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and took them to a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukishke(ph</span>) and also took them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponare(ph</span>), it was a place where those Jews was lined up and shot discriminately, first they had to make their own <span class="DLF">grave</span>, and they were falling in those <span class="DLF">graves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">When | was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, sick in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, that | will tell you later, one of the woman who escaped between the dead bodies came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and in the beginning when she was just a little lucid, she described what happened to her, so</sentence><sentence id="192">we knew for a fact that it was happening.</sentence><sentence id="193">And then, after a few days, she lost her mind.</sentence><sentence id="194">| still remember her yelling and screaming and crying after the children that she lost there, after the family.</sentence><sentence id="195">So it was, a very diabolic plan how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="196">When we were told to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they came, everything was done early in the morning, and my uncle, Yosef(ph) Perski(ph), said to my aunt, "Look, | am not going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>".</sentence><sentence id="197">He was, had a very big advantage, he doesn't look Jewish, he look like a gentile, he look like a Pole and he was a business man that had a lot of connections with Polish peasants.</sentence><sentence id="198">He was buying wood there from them and also dried mushrooms, he says, "| am going there and | want you to go with me".</sentence><sentence id="199">She says, she, my aunt Sonja, who was like a second mother to us, said to him, "I promised my sister on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">death bed</span> that | am, be a second mother and | will take care of those two little girls, Lilla(ph) and Rhya(ph)," this was how we were called, "And | won't leave them alone".</sentence><sentence id="200">We didn't know about it.</sentence><sentence id="201">So they kissed and he sneaked out and he went.</sentence><sentence id="202">We never heard from him.</sentence><sentence id="203">And she went with us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">Before he left, he gave us a few things to put on and as we were walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, | had one coat and one raincoat and the Poles were lined up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and looking at, and | will never forget that they said, "Look at those Jews, they have two coats".</sentence><sentence id="205">So they were, nobody of them lifted a finger and said, "Come, | give you food, | won't let you go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>", because they really were rejoicing what was happening to us.</sentence><sentence id="206">There were two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, the people that were taken to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that | was, were destined to leave.</sentence><sentence id="207">The other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, a lot of people were taken, again, to the <span class="BUILDING">Lukishke prison</span>, from
