class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span>, who had -- he was usually a defense counselor, and he lost most of the cases, as defense counselor in war crimes trials.</sentence><sentence id="1071">But he was a prosecutor, and he lost that one, because there was a guy who was -- I don't even know whether he was a lawyer or not, or he had some lawyer assistance.</sentence><sentence id="1072">And he

shot.</sentence><sentence id="1076">But he was caught later on, I forgot whether in German uniform, or in civilian clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1077">Therefore that stopped it and he was

how important the high ground is.</sentence><sentence id="1661">So I'm sure they had enough people who were studying this thing.</sentence><sentence id="1662">And then with the military, I st -- stayed with a co -- [indecipherable] command general staff college, and stuff like that, which is the second highest educational thing within the army.</sentence><sentence id="1663">The only higher one is <span class="BUILDING">Army War College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1664">I applied for that, but I didn't -- I couldn't get in that one.</sentence><sentence id="1665">So I--I had an

class="DLF">Aberdeen Proving Ground</span>, and I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">VIP suite</span> for myself.</sentence><sentence id="1667">I had one and a half <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span>
