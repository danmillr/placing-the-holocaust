<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I'd like you to begin by telling me your name, date of birth and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: And then continue?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="7">Q: If you would.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: My name is Steve Galezewski.</sentence><sentence id="10">I was born May 11th, 1923 in the Town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> in <span class="REGION">northwest Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">The reason why I am talking today is I am a Pole who was born in a generation, the only generation really, in free <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1918, and then was, of course, was attacked in 1939 by Nazi Germany.</sentence><sentence id="13">Being brought up in the climate of freedom, I probably am a little bit more patriotic than the Poles who were raised in the periods after the Second World War.</sentence><sentence id="14">In my childhood, I was very involved, as well as my father, in the Boy Scout movement.</sentence><sentence id="15">This is the reason why my father was arrested and eventually killed by gestapo, because he was a leader of the youth in the Town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span> where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="16">My childhood was a very happy childhood until the year 1939.</sentence><sentence id="17">At that time, I was 16 years old, and almost, I could say, that at time I had to put the uniform and start my war days.</sentence><sentence id="18">So you can see that I missed all the <span class="BUILDING">high school proms</span> and the fun most of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids have in their last days of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">On September 1 ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="31">Q: Could I just ask you to talk a little bit more about what life was like in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and whether or not you had Jewish friends ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="33">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="34">Well, let's erase the last sentence I had.</sentence><sentence id="35">In the Town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span>, the Jewish population was not very numerous like in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">However, there was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with the <span class="DLF">roof</span> which we thought was gold, gold-leafed roof.</sentence><sentence id="37">One of the better <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">In my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, I did have a class of some 25, 30 people.</sentence><sentence id="39">I had two Jewish boys.</sentence><sentence id="40">I remember their names.</sentence><sentence id="41">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smalish</span> (ph) and the other one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zowagazski</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="42">Two different people.</sentence><sentence id="43">Smalish was not very athletic.</sentence><sentence id="44">He was more or less a sedentary type.</sentence><sentence id="45">The other one, Zowagazski, was involved with us in all the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> activities like soccer, basketball, and he quite often visited my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, so I was fairly close to him.</sentence><sentence id="46">I wish today I knew whether they still alive or what happened to either one of them.</sentence><sentence id="47">When the Germans actually came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span>, I don't recall any activity against the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="48">I don't remember, because most probably they had moved away from the German Army as the German Army came in.</sentence><sentence id="49">The war started for us, the Second World War started for us September 1, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="50">Two, three days before the -- and I should probably also say that I was brought up in a soldier's family.</sentence><sentence id="51">My father was a professional soldier.</sentence><sentence id="52">And two, three days before his regiment, which was the 59th Infantry Regiment, moved to the <span class="DLF">defense line</span> on the <span class="DLF">German border</span>, he called me and gave me a pistol, which was a Walther 7.65 millimeters and had a talk with me man-to-man.</sentence><sentence id="53">And said, "Look, I am leaving.</sentence><sentence id="54">I don't know when I will be back.</sentence><sentence id="55">You are the oldest boy out of three of you.</sentence><sentence id="56">You will assume the role of the head of the family.</sentence><sentence id="57">I want you to take good care of your mother and two brothers.</sentence><sentence id="58">And then, of course, he went to war.</sentence><sentence id="59">Already after the war ended, I learned a lot of things which happens to him during that war.</sentence><sentence id="60">For instance, he was in the Battle of Kura, which was one of the fiercest battles fought during that campaign.</sentence><sentence id="61">And when the entire army was surrounded by German panzer divisions near that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Kura</span>, they were already after three days of fighting without ammunition, without support of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="62">And casualties were extremely heavy.</sentence><sentence id="63">Commanding officer of the regiment, according to the write-ups in the newspapers, called my father and asked him to preserve the regimental flag.</sentence><sentence id="64">Regimental flag for a Polish soldier is something very sacred.</sentence><sentence id="65">Still today, when I see an American flag, for instance, not necessarily Polish, something grabs my heart, and I am ready to take the hat off my head.</sentence><sentence id="66">That's part of the upbringing I grew in.</sentence><sentence id="67">He, according to the versions in the newspapers and accounts of those who survived the prisoner-of-war camp, he apparently broke through the encirclement of Germans and buried the flag in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">Of course, he subsequently in 1940 was arrested by gestapo, that's the last time we saw him, and nobody knew where the flag was.</sentence><sentence id="69">In 1985, someone with a metal detector was going through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and detected that there was something buried.</sentence><sentence id="70">They dug it out and it was a backpack and in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">backpack</span> was the regimental flag, half destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="71">It was restored and is today flying proudly in the <span class="BUILDING">Army Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="72">When father -- when the father was arrested -- this is something which really sticks in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="73">Because the gestapo came in early in the morning, he was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">He was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and they said, "You sit down.</sentence><sentence id="75">We wait for him here."</sentence><sentence id="76">And we waited until he got back from work at 5 o'clock in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="77">To me, it was a horrible because I wanted to warn him and yet, here were the gestapo bandits with a woman and three young boys.</sentence><sentence id="78">And I couldn't do anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="79">Father was accused of trying to break away that region of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the Third Reich.</sentence><sentence id="80">Germans already considered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomerania</span>, that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, as their <span class="REGION">territory</span>, and really, that's why the war started.</sentence><sentence id="81">Because they wanted a <span class="DLF">corridor</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> and to <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, of course, refused to buckle under this trap, and that's how the war started.</sentence><sentence id="83">After arrest of father, we were given 15 minutes to pack belongings and were taken out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and put in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inowroclaw</span>, where we were for about two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="84">After that, we were put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> and shipped out of the Verdun, out of what <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> considered - - what Germans considered <span class="REGION">German territory</span> and were taken to the <span class="REGION">Warsaw region</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span> (ph), the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> were opened and we were let out to start a new life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="137">Q: ... a few questions.</sentence><sentence id="138">You've mentioned that you had Jewish personal friends.</sentence><sentence id="139">Were you aware of a general climate of anti-Semitism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Well, occasionally in the newspaper, you would read that a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish shop</span> was demolished, and that something was going on.</sentence><sentence id="144">But not in the region of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where I come from, that's only from the newspaper I learned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: But was it something that other boys talked about ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: No, that was never really discussed, because to us, a human being was a human being.</sentence><sentence id="150">Whether you are Jewish or -- well, frankly, they were Polish citizens anyway, all of them.</sentence><sentence id="151">So to ask, there was no difference.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: I'm also curious.</sentence><sentence id="156">Before September "39, what you knew about the activities of the Nazi Party ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="159">A: Well, that's -- again, we knew that inevitably something is going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="160">That's why in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> our army was mobilized and we were somewhat prepared.</sentence><sentence id="161">To the extent that, for instance, my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> made donations from all the students, and we purchased a heavy machine gun for the 59th Regiment.</sentence><sentence id="162">It wasn't like you have here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where you have millions of dollars for armament.</sentence><sentence id="163">Out there we had to scratch everything we could to arm ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="164">From my generation, there were some very heroic moves.</sentence><sentence id="165">We didn't have very many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span>, for instance, but we had what we called live torpedoes.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I was so proud of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> help, because she volunteered, 18-year-old girl who was helping my mother in <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, she volunteered as a live torpedo.</sentence><sentence id="167"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, of course, we knew that was fully armed, was belligerent and that the trouble will come from there.</sentence><sentence id="168">Also, their treatment of Jews was giving us indication what will happen if they ever show up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">As a matter of fact, somewhere from 1936, if I'm not wrong, we opened up pretty much for the Jewish people escaping from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or trying to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">We opened up the <span class="DLF">Polish borders</span> and let quite a few of them into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">I'm pretty sure that they -- except for the incidents of anti-Semitism here and there, I'm pretty sure that felt at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, because in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for 30 million population, we had some 3 million Jews.</sentence><sentence id="172">So this was a very big percentage.</sentence><sentence id="173">I don't know how many millions of Jews are in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, but I'm pretty sure not much more than 3 million or maybe even less.</sentence><sentence id="174">We being prepared for a war somewhat, in Boy Scouts on all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to which we went in 1939, we were trying to make them on the Polish/<span class="DLF">German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">And during our campfires, we, of course, sung the Boy Scouts" songs, patriotic songs, always trying to warn Hitler not to try us -- not to try because we would not behave like the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> behaved when Hitler invaded them.</sentence><sentence id="176">We wanted him to know that we will fight.</sentence><sentence id="177">That fight came in finally on September 1, 1939, when 5 o'clock in the morning 21 Heinkels, 88 Stukas bombed the open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">This is the first time I saw dead bodies, not only of horses and animals, but of human beings.</sentence><sentence id="179">Up to that moment, I didn't ever even go to a funeral, so this was for me a very traumatic day.</sentence><sentence id="180">I also when I think about that day, I almost have to laugh at myself.</sentence><sentence id="181">Because the 7.65 millimeter pistol my father me, I was trying to shoot down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">diving bombers</span>, and, of course, it's a laughable thing.</sentence><sentence id="182">It would be just like a fly going with an elephant.</sentence><sentence id="183">The families of military personnel were being evacuated on the fifth day of war, and I decided, although father designated me as the head of family, I decided to designate my younger brother and join the fight.</sentence><sentence id="184">So I gave the pistol to my brother, who was 13 years old.</sentence><sentence id="185">Gave him the same talk father gave me, and very promptly lied my age.</sentence><sentence id="186">I was 16, I had to say I was 18.</sentence><sentence id="187">And I joined the 59th Regiment, that is the unit which was being organized in the back of the fighting unit.</sentence><sentence id="188">Went through most of the fights on the <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tnowroclaw</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovel</span>".</sentence><sentence id="189">The humiliation of the villagers and population was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="190">They were simply machine-gunning women and children, bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> which had nothing to do with the military.</sentence><sentence id="191">In the <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> where we got near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovel</span>", Ukrainians started their own fight and started burning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span>, and started burning and killing Jews and Poles.</sentence><sentence id="192">No wonder that later on, Germans were able to organize SS Militia Division out of the Ukrainians and use them as guards in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193">The war was over basically in October 2nd, 1939, and I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in about November.</sentence><sentence id="194">Didn't get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="195">Most of the Polish Army, of course, either crossed through <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and eventually reorganized in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>; or shed their uniforms with civilian clothing and returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, mother and my brothers were already there.</sentence><sentence id="197">Thank God they survived.</sentence><sentence id="198">Father came in later.</sentence><sentence id="199">He also, after saving the flag, returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in civilian clothing.</sentence><sentence id="200">Of course, he did not talk about the flag at all, so 1 was unaware what was going on in that particular thing.</sentence><sentence id="201">When I was asked by the historians, I couldn't contribute much on that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Was he angry that you hadn't followed his directions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="248">Actually, we were all happy that everything finished and we were still together.</sentence><sentence id="249">Then, of course, after he was arrested and we were transported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, we started a new chapter in our lives.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="253">Q: I just wanted to ask you.</sentence><sentence id="254">You mentioned that you and your family was put in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for a few months or ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: A couple of weeks.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: ... a couple of weeks.</sentence><sentence id="260">Who all was in there with your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="263">A: All the people like us who did not want to become .</sentence><sentence id="264">In that <span class="REGION">area</span>, Germans considered that <span class="REGION">territory</span> German, and they gave people an option to sign a German list.</sentence><sentence id="265">Yes, I am a German.</sentence><sentence id="266">And we considered ourselves Poles, and we did not want to become Germans.</sentence><sentence id="267">So all those people were simply taken out of their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and transported to what they considered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: And the Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, as well?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: I don't recall that.</sentence><sentence id="275">I don't recall specifically seeing Jews in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: What happened at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: This was a camp from which you either landed eventually <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span> or some other big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or like in our case, being transported to the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, move them away from the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">We were called displaced persons, DPs as they called them, they called us after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: Do you remember exactly what your family thought about what was going on, why you were being moved?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: Well, father, of course, was gone.</sentence><sentence id="285">With mother, talking about things of that was -- well, it was not normal to talk to mother about things men talked about, let's put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="286">It doesn't mean that women were not treated equally in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, by any chance.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="290">Q: Were you frightened?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="292">A: No, at that age and from what I already went through, I wasn't frightened.</sentence><sentence id="293">Frankly, I wanted to fight.</sentence><sentence id="294">I wanted to revenge what they have done up to now from what I have seen.</sentence><sentence id="295">And remember one thing, that I was born in free <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">I was brought as a free Pole, and I couldn't stand, for instance, things we were required in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">Like at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> or to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> or to a <span class="DLF">park</span> where children play, a sign, "For Poles, Jews and dogs, entrance forbidden."</sentence><sentence id="298">Or when I see a German walking on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>, I'm supposed to step into the <span class="DLF">gutter</span>, take my hat off, bow, and stay in that position until he moves away three paces from me.</sentence><sentence id="299">Those were not things compatible with freedom I enjoyed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">Therefore, I was looking for a <span class="NPIP">source</span> where I could arm myself and fight.</sentence><sentence id="301">I thought about crossing the <span class="DLF">border</span> and getting to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where Polish troops were being organized.</sentence><sentence id="302">Somehow that didn't happen, because when they let us out of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, we had absolutely no money.</sentence><sentence id="303">We had absolutely no time to take anything from our <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, jewelry or anything.</sentence><sentence id="304">We were simply taken out.</sentence><sentence id="305">And incidentally, into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, they put Germans whom they transferred from like where they are to other <span class="NPIP">regions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="306">So in one minute, you lost your entire life's assets.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: What was the ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="324">A: That was like April, May 1940 -- I'm sorry, "41.</sentence><sentence id="325">Not so sure, not so sure.</sentence><sentence id="326">It's "40, "41, somewhere there.</sentence><sentence id="327">One thing I should also mention, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span>, incidentally, they burned it.</sentence><sentence id="328">But first, they took the golden leaves off.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="329">Q: Who else would have been ?</sentence><sentence id="330">Did they prevent you from going into <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> or ...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="331">A: There were absolutely no <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> beyond the sixth grade.</sentence><sentence id="332">Germans considered us a race which was supposed to be eliminated after they eliminated the Jewish race.</sentence><sentence id="333">We were the number two in <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">And, therefore, they said they don't have to be educated beyond the simple reading and arithmetics.</sentence><sentence id="335">Therefore, no <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="336">Of course, immediately the underground high schools sprang up, and the former teachers, you know, they were meeting in groups of four, five, ten private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and continuing the studies.</sentence><sentence id="337"><span class="BUILDING">Universities</span>, of course, were nonexistent for Poles.</sentence><sentence id="338">In the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, I was a stranger.</sentence><sentence id="339">I didn't know anybody.</sentence><sentence id="340">It took some time before I started to know who is who.</sentence><sentence id="341">I have joined, of course, first thing, the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">underground high school</span> where I continued my studies.</sentence><sentence id="342">Out there among the boys, I found my first contact on the fighting underground.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="355">Q: Let me change the tape.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="357">A: Well, that was among these students in this <span class="BUILDING">underground high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="358">And after a while, I was asked to join an underground organization, fighting organization.</sentence><sentence id="359">And I was worn in; of course, I have to be certain that I was swearing the obedience to the right people and fortunately I did.</sentence><sentence id="360">Because this was the Polish government under the allies, which was at the time located in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="361">I won't say much about the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, but I will mention one thing.</sentence><sentence id="362">That my last year in that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, the principal came in to me and said, "Look, you are in endangering the group.</sentence><sentence id="363">We will give you your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> certificate.</sentence><sentence id="364">You don't have to attend any more of the <span class="BUILDING">classes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="365">We know you are engaged in the underground activities."</sentence><sentence id="366">And he did that to a couple of other boys from my group, so we basically did not finish the actual, listening to actual lectures.</sentence><sentence id="367">But we got the graduation on the merit of what we had done up to that point.</sentence><sentence id="368">And that was, of course, the second year.</sentence><sentence id="369">I was in this almost 18 months.</sentence><sentence id="370">The beginning, my beginning in -- also, general life conditions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk- Suwatki</span> at that time -- in 1940 when we arrived there, I think it was late 1940.</sentence><sentence id="371">The Jews already had to wear the Star of David on the arm band, but they were not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">They lived in their own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> like they did before.</sentence><sentence id="373">And I think late in 1940, I remember, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span>.</sentence><sentence id="374">This was a very unique <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because no wires or no <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> were put in.</sentence><sentence id="375">But they simply designated four main <span class="DLF">streets</span> as the boundaries of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="376">Of course, the order of the day was that any Jew who was found <span class="NPIP">outside</span> of that was shot on the spot, and that happened quite often.</sentence><sentence id="377">I didn't see, personally, myself the shooting, but I've seen the bodies.</sentence><sentence id="378">Something happened maybe 15 minutes I arrived at that point.</sentence><sentence id="379">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I think was fairly loose and a lot of Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk-Suwatki</span>, I think managed to mingle with Poles and get away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, according to various villagers.</sentence><sentence id="380">And farmers, of course, it depends again on the personality of the farmer.</sentence><sentence id="381">Quite for money, quite often for humanitarian reasons, they would hide and save the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="382">This was very dangerous for Poles because anytime you helped a Jew by giving him bread or milk or whatever, food or sheltering, you endangered your entire family and your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="383">It happened many, many times where a neighbor who didn't like his neighbor said, "Hey, my neighbor yesterday gave something to the Jews who came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>."</sentence><sentence id="384">Well, that entire family was wiped out, and their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">And the news all around was arriving, this happened in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>; this happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="386">So population, Polish population basically was very frightened and very careful on it.</sentence><sentence id="387">This probably could be the reason why it was universally practiced.</sentence><sentence id="388">On the other hand, AK, which is the underground organization to which I belonged, and that means -- AK means Army Krajowa, which is home army.</sentence><sentence id="389">Had very specific orders to assist and help as much as possible by absorbing young Jews who were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and wanted to join the guerrillas, they were welcomed with open arms.</sentence><sentence id="390">As a matter of fact, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, we had an example of that.</sentence><sentence id="391">In my combat organization, Mr. Harter, who belongs to veteran's organization, veteran guerilla organization, was saved by Poles and survived the war by being in the guerilla unit.</sentence><sentence id="392">I heard of many, many instances of the same thing happening, but this is my personal involvement with Mr. Harter.</sentence><sentence id="393">My beginning in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> was simply what they call small sabotage.</sentence><sentence id="394">We were putting placards on <span class="DLF">streets</span>, anti-German, trying to change their morale, which at the time at the beginning, 1940, "41, was still pretty high.</sentence><sentence id="395">But we were trying to pass some messages to them by graffiti type, by placards, by all possible means that the war, the fighting is a hopeless war.</sentence><sentence id="396">They're not going to win.</sentence><sentence id="397">After a few months, I graduated from this small sabotage into the real fighting unit where we were, for instance, protecting the parachute drops from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="398">We also were protecting on other occasions the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> which was communicating with the West.</sentence><sentence id="399">In 1941 there were still very few actual attacks on German compounds, but in 1942 the speed of the military involvement increased.</sentence><sentence id="400">And in that I took part, and oh, in 1942 in blowing up two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">In 1943, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ammunition train</span>, we blew up and also took materials to support ourselves from various <span class="BUILDING">industrial complexes</span> like a <span class="BUILDING">chocolate factory</span> where we took tons and tons of sugar.</sentence><sentence id="402">We loaded them on the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> the peasants supplied.</sentence><sentence id="403">And then sold that for money to support the guerilla activities.</sentence><sentence id="404">Blew up a <span class="BUILDING">vodka distillery</span>, other smaller activities wherein the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> -- in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, Germans said you have to deliver so many horses, so many cows, so many tons of grain or potatoes for the Germany effort.</sentence><sentence id="405">And usually, there were designated people who were responsible for that.</sentence><sentence id="406">And those people knowing that they're working and they can be banished for it, they were very eager.</sentence><sentence id="407">We tried to dampen their enthusiasm and warn them not to do it in a too eager way.</sentence><sentence id="408">If someone like that didn't listen to us, next time we took him and publicly in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, let's say, 50 lashes.</sentence><sentence id="409">We also watched women, that they wouldn't go with German soldiers or German civilians.</sentence><sentence id="410">If that happened and she didn't get the warning and continued, a unit would go shave her head to zero and put a finger on her that she was a prostitute.</sentence><sentence id="411">Smaller other things, and usually the boys 12, 13, girls even were involved in it.</sentence><sentence id="412">In the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span>, there would be a German with a Polish prostitute in the mink coat.</sentence><sentence id="413">Well, they would have the spray bottle with the strong acid, and very quietly would spray that acid on the fur coat of the girl.</sentence><sentence id="414">By the time the girl was leaving the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span>, the fur coat was almost falling off her back.</sentence><sentence id="415">Those were the expressions of resistance from the youngest all the way up.</sentence><sentence id="416">We tried to liberate our prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="417">We attacked several <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> and liberated quite a few.</sentence><sentence id="418">What Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, however, for every German killed, they tried to wipe out 25, 50 Poles.</sentence><sentence id="419">And what they would usually do, they would put a sign on all the visible places in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> that today or yesterday a German soldier was attacked and killed.</sentence><sentence id="420">For that 50 Poles tomorrow will be executed, although they were listed as possible people to go free.</sentence><sentence id="421">So the terror was unbelievable, but by the year 1942, "43, we realized that if we were doing nothing as we were in 1940, let's say, the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, we were dying.</sentence><sentence id="422">We were being hanged on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="423">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were full of Poles, not only Jews, but Poles.</sentence><sentence id="424">Of course, those Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were Poles anyway, so there's no distinction there.</sentence><sentence id="425">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish located camps</span>, Germans, of course, brought Jews from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="426">From that you can see what the situation was developing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="427">So we finally decided, hey, if we have to die, we might as well die taking some of them with us, and that's where this pace of resistance accelerated.</sentence><sentence id="428">And that's where more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went up, more <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were blown up.</sentence><sentence id="429">More attacks on the <span class="DLF">airfields</span> and other military objectives happened.</sentence><sentence id="430">By 1942, I think it's July 1942, in July 1942 out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I think they have taken some 220 people and in one day shot them at the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span>, at the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="431">Now, I have not witnessed that, but it was universally known.</sentence><sentence id="432">On August 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk ghetto</span> was liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="433">What happened is the Germans, Latvians, Ukrainians with the assistance of the Jewish police, rounded all inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="434">A few thousand people were in that <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, and they didn't know what is going to happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="435">They stayed there overnight.</sentence><sentence id="436">Some were trying to escape, and they were, of course, shot during the escape.</sentence><sentence id="437">Next day in a column -- they formed the columns and all the inhabitants of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were marched into the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> where numerous <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> were waiting for them.</sentence><sentence id="438">They were loaded with the help again of Jewish police.</sentence><sentence id="439">The Jewish police, although not armed, they had baseball bats, all of them, and special hats and special arm bands.</sentence><sentence id="440">During that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and during the gathering of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, the word was that about 1,000 of the Jews were shot.</sentence><sentence id="441">Where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> went, I'm not sure whether they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="442">I have witnessed the march from a <span class="DLF">window</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> to which they were going, I have witnessed the march of the Jews to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="443">I have not seen personally anyone killed, because the <span class="REGION">region</span> where I was was rather short visible from the <span class="DLF">window</span> where I was.</sentence><sentence id="444">But I could hear the shots, and then the word came in the next day and the following day among Poles that about 1,000 were shot during that incident.</sentence><sentence id="445">So this was the finish and annihilation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="446">There were, of course, 500 craftsmen -- tailors, shoemakers, people who were taken out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> before, and they were housed in the Copernicus (ph) School, and they were working for the German Army, working on the German uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="447">Working on producing shoes, doing things which were useful for the German Army.</sentence><sentence id="448">From that group, sometimes in 1943, "42, "43, some 200 were taken and shot again in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="449">The remaining 300 plus stayed and continued to work for the army.</sentence><sentence id="450">On January 6th, which happens to be a Polish Catholic holiday, that's why I remember the date, was the annihilation of the rest of the Jews from the <span class="BUILDING">Copernicus School</span>.</sentence><sentence id="451">How did that happen?</sentence><sentence id="452">And that I personally witnessed.</sentence><sentence id="453">At that time I had the documents on my own name; however, they were documents very strong which I received from the <span class="DLF">underground channels</span>, underground help.</sentence><sentence id="454">I was a fireman in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="455">There was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> where several of us from the underground were employed for the simple reason that those documents allowed us to be on the <span class="DLF">street</span> after the curfew.</sentence><sentence id="456">Curfew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was like 7 o'clock, and after 7 o'clock, no Jew, no Pole could be on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="457">Only Germans were allowed to be after curfew on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="458">So with those documents, of course, we could go on our underground activities, gather for the job to be done somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="459">That very morning on the 6th of January, we noticed shooting.</sentence><sentence id="460">And looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> we see a lot of smoke coming out.</sentence><sentence id="461">Being, of course, a fire brigade in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, our concern was supposed to be a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but we decided to go and see if we can help and put the fire out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">So we all put the helmets on, jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, and went toward the smoke.</sentence><sentence id="463">Well, the smoke was coming in from the <span class="BUILDING">Copernicus School</span> where the remnants of the Jewish population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> were housed.</sentence><sentence id="464">On arrival, the entire <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was in flames.</sentence><sentence id="465">The <span class="DLF">roof</span> was on the verge of collapse.</sentence><sentence id="466">Outside one could see uniformed Latvians, Germans, Sicherheitspolizei, and Polish police shooting at the <span class="DLF">window</span> and generally trying to finish whoever was trying to get out of the fire.</sentence><sentence id="467">I could see two piles of bodies some six, seven feet high, piled up next to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="468">I could see on the ledges of <span class="DLF">windows</span> half-burned bodies.</sentence><sentence id="469">I could a mother with a little child trying to throw the child out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> when someone shot her and killed her.</sentence><sentence id="470">The thing which stayed with me for many, many, many years after the war, however, was an incident which happened a few steps from me.</sentence><sentence id="471">A gendarme, a German six-foot plus tall, because I am six foot so I can judge the height, some 250 pounds heavy takes a little Jewish girl by the hand.</sentence><sentence id="472">Leads her to the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, sits her by that <span class="DLF">wall</span>, corrects her posture even.</sentence><sentence id="473">Moves back a few steps and shoots her right in the head.</sentence><sentence id="474">Now, at a moment like that, one is ready, of course, to jump and do something, but what could one do?</sentence><sentence id="475">I could only pay back for happenings like that through my underground activities.</sentence><sentence id="476">Because anything on the spot out there would have meant death to all of us.</sentence><sentence id="477">I did not want this to be forgotten in case they do not have in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> any records of what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk- Suwatki</span>.</sentence><sentence id="478">Two often one hears the Holocaust never happened.</sentence><sentence id="479">Well, here is one eyewitness who saw what was going on and what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="480">Where the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> were taken, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="481">Whether this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>, whether this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, but usually those three were the main sources of

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="673">A: Well, let's first talk about the organization of underground.</sentence><sentence id="674">In the early days of war, that means 1939, "40, there were multitudes of organizations, underground organizations, all eager to fight Germans.</sentence><sentence id="675">They ranged from the extreme left to the extreme right.</sentence><sentence id="676">In the extreme right, you had what probably what gave the rest of us the anti-Semitic, how you call it?</sentence><sentence id="677">The anti-Semitic, I'm fighting for a name, image.</sentence><sentence

in 1943, "43, one could consider entire nation in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="684">It had all kinds of functions like medical/sanitary functions all over

officers" school, which I took for several months in 1942, "43.</sentence><sentence id="696">During that period, for instance, that gives you an idea to what extent we went during those several months, there were numerous instances where we fired live ammunition.</sentence><sentence id="697">Where we spent nights and nights in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> learning the survival techniques.</sentence><sentence id="698">Occasionally, on something like that there would be an action where you would blow up a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or something.</sentence><sentence id="699">During the -- the aim was so well specified that in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, the military

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="749">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="750">And incidentally, his name is Tarchinski (ph), I remember still.</sentence><sentence id="751">And he was after being beaten, the doctors advised gestapo that he will die if he is not taken to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="752">So they took him to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a gendarmes or gestapo man sitting by his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="753">Well, we went to free him in German uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="754">We entered, nobody even stopped us.</sentence><sentence id="755">The man by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> of our comrade didn't even lift himself off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> when we entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="756">Several, several actions were performed in such a fashion that either German uniforms or gestapo uniforms were worn.</sentence><sentence id="757">I was myself in gestapo uniform two, three times on various actions.</sentence><sentence id="758">It's not universally known in the West, but some very, very high-ranking SS officers were executed in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">One of them was the head of the gestapo for the entire <span class="REGION">eastern region</span>.</sentence><sentence id="760">His name was General Kiichira.</sentence><sentence id="761">If I remember, he was even son-in-law of Himmler.</sentence><sentence id="762">He was executed on <span class="DLF">Warsaw street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="763">The death sentence was given to him for his activities against Poles and Jews, and he was executed.</sentence><sentence id="764">So you can see that we had the -- not only the judge, but we had also the executioners in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="781">Q: First of all, how was the underground economy?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="783">A: This is all entire <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> underground.</sentence><sentence id="784">Schooling system, medical system, court system and then army.</sentence><sentence id="785">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> uprising started on August 1, the so-called what we call code name Buja (ph), which is tempest.</sentence><sentence id="786">Tempest was declared, and out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> some 300,000 underground people came out in various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and started hitting the German units.</sentence><sentence id="787">How the uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> started, 5 o'clock in the afternoon -- and again, every unit had objective.</sentence><sentence id="788">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> was taking the powerhouse, this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> was taking <span class="BUILDING">post office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="789">Some other unit was taking the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="790">On 5 o'clock, August 1, 1944, <span class="DLF">windows</span> suddenly opened and any German on the <span class="DLF">street</span> was just killed from the <span class="DLF">window</span> by people like you and me.</sentence><sentence id="791"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> uprising was ready and was supposed to last four, five days at the most.</sentence><sentence id="792">And we had enough ammunition and supplies for that.</sentence><sentence id="793">By that time it was universally assumed by all of us that there will be landings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, that Marines will be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">The Polish forces, the paratroop brigades that we had, will be dropped on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="795">Instead, what they did they took and annihilated that part of brigade in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.001913" long="5.928555">Arnheim</span>.</sentence><sentence id="796">That was incidentally, under the leadership of General Sasaboski (ph).</sentence><sentence id="797">When you look at the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> "Bridge Afar," Sasaboski is mentioned and the paratroopers are mentioned in it.</sentence><sentence id="798">The Warsaw 3 uprising lasted 62 days instead of those four, five days.</sentence><sentence id="799">And I would say that almost everybody was involved in that fighting.</sentence><sentence id="800">Civilian people were digging the <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, were putting the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> on every <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="801">Young children were used to take messages in between.</sentence><sentence id="802"><span class="BUILDING">Kitchens</span> were set up my housewives all over.</sentence><sentence id="803">It was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="804">In first days, almost entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was in our hands.</sentence><sentence id="805">After those five, six days when there was no ammunition, only that ammunition we had which we took from Germans, was taken.</sentence><sentence id="806">Germans used some unusual techniques.</sentence><sentence id="807">For instance, to give you an example.</sentence><sentence id="808">Barricaded, they cannot take.</sentence><sentence id="809">Any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> they use gets burned by the Molotov cocktails from <span class="DLF">windows</span> all over.</sentence><sentence id="810"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Tank</span> on narrow <span class="DLF">streets</span> is not a good weapon to use.</sentence><sentence id="811">But they had armor, so the people were protected out there.</sentence><sentence id="812">As long as they stayed away from the <span class="REGION">area</span> approaching the <span class="DLF">barricade</span>, they could fire that cannon and then machine gun at will.</sentence><sentence id="813">And we couldn't do much because all we had is the rifles and then the pistols.</sentence><sentence id="814">What they did in a couple of instances in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, they surrounded the wives, mothers and children, put them in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, and moved them toward the <span class="DLF">barricades</span>.</sentence><sentence id="815">And the people behind the <span class="DLF">barricade</span> see the mother, see their sister, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="816">They know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="817">You shoot your own or you let them break your <span class="DLF">barricade</span> and make a <span class="DLF">breach</span> into your <span class="DLF">defense line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="818">Well, you're faced with decisions like that.</sentence><sentence id="819">I won't tell you what happened in those instances, but you figure out what you would do in a case like that.</sentence><sentence id="820">They also invented, I would say, what we call the Goliath.</sentence><sentence id="821">It's a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span>, small one, maybe one meter long.</sentence><sentence id="822">And they put on it half a ton, two- or three-quarter of a ton of dynamite, and this was electrically controlled and they could direct it.</sentence><sentence id="823">Here is a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which we're defending for two weeks, they cannot take it.</sentence><sentence id="824">They direct that right at the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and they explode it right at the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">Of course, not only this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> but <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> around go with -- just like what you've seen here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in car bombs.</sentence><sentence id="826"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> finally fell after 62 days of furies, out of AK, some 17,000 died.</sentence><sentence id="827">Total population loss in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was over 300,000 in 62 days.</sentence><sentence id="828">If you look at it from the perspective of Vietnam War where in some dozen years our casualties were approaching 60,000, here it would give you an idea of the ferocity of the fighting.</sentence><sentence id="829">In 62 days, you have over 300,000 casualties.</sentence><sentence id="830">Of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> negotiated the surrender with the German Army.</sentence><sentence id="831">The German Army was pulled from the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>, was pulled from wherever they could find them to just defeat <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> because that was their <span class="DLF">road</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="832">At that time in other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- and incidentally, during the negotiations the Warsaw commander negotiated with Germans that the AK guerrillas and the fighters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> will be considered under the Geneva Convention.</sentence><sentence id="833">Up to that moment, they considered us bandits.</sentence><sentence id="834">In other words, anybody could shoot us without getting any responsibility for it, taking responsibility for it.</sentence><sentence id="835">The surrender conditions were that they all will be treated under the Geneva Convention.</sentence><sentence id="836">That means they will go to the regular prisoner of war camp, and that, they lived up to that, one must say.</sentence><sentence id="837">The rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> continued fighting.</sentence><sentence id="838">The rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> continued fighting and was fighting -- Soviet troops, of course, came in through treachery by inviting the Polish officers for the joint strategy sessions, the Russians invited them and those officers never came back.</sentence><sentence id="839">4 They landed all in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">The troops without the officers were surrounded by Soviet troops, were disarmed and forcibly forced into a Polish Army under the Soviet command, which had an obedience to a Soviet puppet government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="841">They created a Polish government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> consisting of some hard-nosed Polish Communists.</sentence><sentence id="842">I found myself in that army eventually, and in that army, incidentally, that army was being organized east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Homel</span>!</sentence><sentence id="843">and <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>.</sentence><sentence id="845">We had out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> five guards, which were put into this time, not an underground anymore, but a formal <span class="BUILDING">court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="846">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> found them guilty of atrocities against the Polish and Jewish population, and they were sentenced to death.</sentence><sentence id="847">And the execution of the guards was performed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="848">My company was assigned to put a <span class="DLF">barrier</span> between the witnesses, the hundreds and thousands even of population, and the place of execution.</sentence><sentence id="849">The place of execution was very simple, the gallows was put up and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came in with the open back.</sentence><sentence id="850">The guardsmen with their hands tied and their legs tied were stationed on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="851">And on command, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> moved and they simply dropped and were hanged.</sentence><sentence id="852">We only hanged four of them because one of them hanged himself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="853">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, I was a company commander as a second lieutenant.</sentence><sentence id="854">That unit was training for battlefront activities, and after a few weeks, I discovered that most of the soldiers in the unit are the Polish guerrillas, AK.</sentence><sentence id="855">Officers like me who were commanding different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">companies</span>, they were also AK.</sentence><sentence id="856">Well, we got together; we got together, and we have decided that we have to organize something within this brigade, when the allies finally show up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, that we as a unit can then arrest all the Soviet officers in the unit and all the political officers in the unit and simply fully armed cross into the <span class="REGION">allied side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="857">Well, after a few weeks, we accomplished that, and we had underground army within the Soviet Army.</sentence><sentence id="858">We made contact on the commander officer of the AK for the <span class="REGION">Lublin region</span>, which was still operating.</sentence><sentence id="859">He was underground, he was not arrested by the Russians and gave himself under his command.</sentence><sentence id="860">This is probably silly to say at this point, but I will mention it.</sentence><sentence id="861">We made a proposal to this particular head of the underground for that <span class="REGION">region</span> that in October when there was a big parade was going to be held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="862">And in that parade the entire Polish government formed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> plus Marshal Orkorsowski (ph) and some Soviet generals were supposed to on the tribune receiving the parade of all the Polish troops, which were ready to go into battle.</sentence><sentence id="863">This is October/November 1944 at that time.</sentence><sentence id="864">We made a proposal that we give our soldiers live ammunition for that parade, and the moment we are in front of the tribunes, we open fire at the government and show the world that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> does not want what Soviets are bringing, and that that government created by Soviets in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> means nothing to us.</sentence><sentence id="865">We are obeying the government inland at that time which was cooperating fully with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and allies.</sentence><sentence id="866">Well, supposedly, the message was sent to them and came back saying, "Forget about what you're proposing because Stalin would then make out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> simply a Soviet Republic like he made it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span>."</sentence><sentence id="867">So we promptly forgot it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: I'm going to ask you stop at this point.</sentence><sentence id="956">When you were talking about the hanging of the guards at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span>, is this the period when you and the Soviet Army liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="959">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="960">That was already four, six weeks after.</sentence><sentence id="961"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.222764" long="22.5984247">Majdanek</span> was liberated I believe in July somewhere, and this was happening July, August, September; end of September somewhere.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="967">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="968">At that time I was still in the Polish underground in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="971">Q: And when you were speaking about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> rising and how people were fighting all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the summer of "44, where were you at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="973">A: Okay, a week before the Warsaw uprising started, we pretty much knew that the end was nearing.</sentence><sentence id="974">Because you could see on the major <span class="DLF">highways</span> from east to west chaos.</sentence><sentence id="975">It reminded us of 1939, where you could civilians, you could see German soldiers individually, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, on foot, on horseback, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military vehicle</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="976">You could see that the panic was setting and that they were running from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">So a week before uprising started, we went to destroy all the communications between the east and west.</sentence><sentence id="978">That meant all the <span class="DLF">telephone lines</span>, all the <span class="DLF">railroad lines</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="979">I was assigned the <span class="REGION">region</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and we simply blew up the <span class="DLF">rails</span>.</sentence><sentence id="980">Somebody else did the <span class="DLF">telephone poles</span> and got them down.</sentence><sentence id="981">Somebody else in the different regions west -- I mean east of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span> did the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="982">Then we had a concentration of our entire <span class="REGION">area</span> ordered for a certain time and certain date.</sentence><sentence id="983">And after accomplishing our blowing up of the rails, we decided to move to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration point</span>.</sentence><sentence id="984">At that concentration point, there was supposed to be 22nd Infantry Regiment and Brigade Calvary which is the Mazovian Calvary Brigade.</sentence><sentence id="985">One of my boys said, "Well, inside of walking, how about getting a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and riding there?"</sentence><sentence id="986">Well, we decided that that was not a bad idea, and took the fire engine from the <span class="BUILDING">fire station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="987">We put our guns under the blankets.</sentence><sentence id="988">Put the helmets on, and drove out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, not directly to the concentration point, but on the <span class="DLF">secondary roads</span> we stayed overnight in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="989">Next day, we still stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because to get to concentration point, we had to cross the main <span class="DLF">highway</span>, and by that time, the front was already nearing.</sentence><sentence id="990">You could see the entire <span class="DLF">sky</span> red, you could hear the guns.</sentence><sentence id="991">You could hear the , which were the Soviet rockets.</sentence><sentence id="992">So at the -- in the evening when it was just about dark, we started moving, and we got to the main <span class="DLF">highway</span> in total darkness without lights, without anything.</sentence><sentence id="993">It seemed to be absolutely empty.</sentence><sentence id="994">We got on the major <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="995">Suddenly I see somebody striking a match, and my heart stopped.</sentence><sentence id="996">I see an SS helmet, and I see unshaven faces of several SS soldiers.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1023">Q: I hate to do this, but we're out of tape.</sentence><sentence id="1024">It's a bad point to stop.</sentence><sentence id="1025">Okay, let me just do something for a second.</sentence><sentence id="1026">When we unfortunately stopped you, you saw the SS helmets.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1031">A: Almost automatically without thinking, I hit the bell on the fire engine, and we kept going on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1032">And the Germans either because they are so disciplined, and to them it was very logical that somebody was driving -- that the fire engine was going towards the fire, didn't even think.</sentence><sentence id="1033">We passed that <span class="DLF">turnoff</span> where we were supposed to turn off and disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1034">What happened there, it was an SS Hermann Goring panzer division.</sentence><sentence id="1035">Four days later when we went through the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> out there, we could see the remnants of some of the <span

us.</sentence><sentence id="1038">Because the front was still east of us, and they were withdrawing west.</sentence><sentence id="1039">So that night I see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> very high, flying from west to east.</sentence><sentence id="1040">One of them burns, comes down like a meteor, and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="1041">The next morning, I'm going on a patrol with a group of soldiers to penetrate the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> to see if anything is going out which were like few hundred yards from us.</sentence><sentence id="1042">In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, we see movement.</sentence><sentence id="1043">We see uniforms which don't look German.</sentence><sentence id="1044">That's where Soviet paratroopers with a <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span>, they were dropped behind the <span class="DLF">German line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1045">Well, we kind of waved at each other, the white thing.</sentence><sentence id="1046">Started talking.</sentence><sentence id="1047">From them we learned that they were parachuted behind.</sentence><sentence id="1048">We told them we are the Polish

class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1052">Their headquarter wanted to know our strength, our <span class="NPIP">location</span>, where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1053">Well, I wasn't going to give it to them, but I gave them a guide and sent them to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1054">They wanted information, <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> could give it to them.</sentence><sentence id="1055">Four days later, we were withdrawing -- and incidentally, our involvement at that time was very simple.</sentence><sentence id="1056">We didn't get into any major fight.</sentence><sentence id="1057">All we were doing was disarming single or two, three German soldiers running away.</sentence><sentence id="1058">So it wasn't the war I was really trained for.</sentence><sentence id="1059">Four days after that, we're passing through the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we met this SS Hermann Goring division.</sentence><sentence id="1060">And the burned bodies in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were really telling us that that big tank battle between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Soviet tanks</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> took place there, and that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German
