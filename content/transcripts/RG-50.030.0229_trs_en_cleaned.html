illness, not to go in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>, but it was always more and more difficult and and dangerous to play this way, and he made some ___ operation like like uh abscess...he got some abscess and uh profits were made on the operation then he was was always able through me to find a way to to pay somebody to help us and there was literally illness then I was able to speak with this physician or professor to pay something, give a longer time for for this illness to___, but every second or third month he got there uh called up to the military service so he find a way...I don't know somebody give this ID...yes...and get and get their ID when he he can go in a in a <span class="BUILDING">mental hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">Then the

made ten months , but you know I will not find out that the professor who was the the head from his <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, he was in this , but my husband went in in this uh uh <span class="BUILDING">mental hospital</span> and to make a little shorter the story, he was able to spend there six months.</sentence><sentence id="129">That was a big, big time in in the very very dangerous time.</sentence><sentence id="130">I was every day there from forenoon till evening and what was quite difficult for me that the the physician...he was the respon...responsible for this for this uh part from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>...he never asked my husband, yeah my husband decided we didn't know what what this means to be mentally ill, because we'd never read, never learned it was so imm...immediately and my husband thought I decide not to speak with people.</sentence><sentence id="131">I will speak only with you.</sentence><sentence id="132">And and not with the physician and not others, but I didn't know that this is good or not good, so almost every afternoon, evening when I wanted to left the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, the physician asked me what I have seen, what was the behavior from my husband and almost day after day I was pressed to find out something but give a picture that he is really not normal.</sentence><sentence id="133">He was living...he had he had a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he was speaking, everything, even playing a little cards, but this was not the way to to be mentally ill, so always I find out something that I wanted, that he was very depressed and I thought to play a little cards would be...but he was confused and he didn't find the the way how to play, and each time I have had the feeling I was always (laughter)...but I was forced to make always these everyday stories that my husband really could be hold uh so with this way I think it finished.</sentence><sentence id="134">He got the papers that he is uh mentally ill.</sentence><sentence id="135">This was official.</sentence><sentence id="136">There was a a from the state or uh supervisor, a professor to make some

class="BUILDING">real estate places</span>, this was written in the register book that he is he is not right to sign this uh contract or something I am responsible uh temporary, temporary.</sentence><sentence id="137">It was not for another time when the when the professor or somebody will say that he is OK, he is healthy, so this was a very difficult time but on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> it was very difficult every day to go there and to play this play, but on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> he was safe in there.</sentence><sentence id="138">It was...and several times I have seen that was coming military police to look.</sentence><sentence id="139">He was not alone in this in this <span class="BUILDING">mental

temporary thing.</sentence><sentence id="294">What will happen with us if it is not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were living, and I went this young person.</sentence><sentence id="295">I went in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="296">He showed me which uh...attached there is two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and the <span

thing there is a particular person.</sentence><sentence id="306">He told me that the <span class="DLF">door</span> will be always open and there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>, and this was very very important and we decided to change the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">We left this our <span class="BUILDING">flat</span> with a lot of belongings there and we take the the minimum <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and something that was necessary to this <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> and we made a friendship with this uh factory owner.</sentence><sentence id="308">He he immediately take us in like a worker in this in this uh <span class="BUILDING">war factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="309">That was a...that gives a big difference because...uh I cannot remember what was the order that Jewish people from the from the signed <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> can go out between eleven or...till one...something like this, for a short time to arrange something or buy something or was survival was to buy.</sentence><sentence id="310">But the somebody had these these uh document that he is working in for the military, military service.</sentence><sentence id="311">This gives a longer uh time to to to strolling <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and this was very important.</sentence><sentence id="312">So it was quite a, quite a good life.</sentence><sentence id="313">It was written...1 was luha person always I was looking the good <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">Now we are in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">The other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is took in uh

and she was looking always after my children, uh a Jewish person, a Jewish woman, an elderly woman and there was living eight, nine, nine or ten person in this two-room <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span>, but there was living.</sentence><sentence id="317">In uh during this time I think it was May...for that and we got a lot of control.</sentence><sentence id="318">I am not a historian to to...and we had heard that the...in the... what happened in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> everywhere and what was the meaning <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">That I think there was together and what the meaning deportation.</sentence><sentence id="320">Not exactly...only about.</sentence><sentence id="321">We didn't get any any detail how was this deportation...really mainly I, I wasn't not to think about only the bad things.</sentence><sentence id="322">Always I I was looking what is deportation.</sentence><sentence id="323">To take the people another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work.</sentence><sentence id="324">Maybe uncomfortable maybe but this is the maximum what uh what I was able to imagine.</sentence><sentence id="325">But we have heard about the concentra...what what is happening on the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">In the meantime I was not very interested with uh Zionist movement.</sentence><sentence id="327">I have heard sometimes from my husband that he is a Zionist.</sentence><sentence id="328">OK.</sentence><sentence id="329">It's his business, and he went always out from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...a lot of telephones and he hold his horse on connection, but I was not very interested as long...he was....I think we had had a feeling during July...it was continued this deportation from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we began to get the feeling that now is our turn because this deportation, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> together...put together the people and put in because it came very very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, till the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="330">And it was a a feeling that tomorrow, after tomorrow our turn is coming.</sentence><sentence id="331">Then uh I think it may be August...we get some some information that what is stopped uh ____ you know, ...uh stopped the deportations.</sentence><sentence id="332">And he changed the government and will be another uh solution but uh what will happen with the Jewish population, so we get a little breathe, and uh to change the government it really means a little more liberal and only to hear the the announced that what is stopped, the deportation, so it was a little bit out from the immediately danger, but I must tell you that I didn't shout that the deportation it is dead.</sentence><sentence id="333">I didn't run to understand.</sentence><sentence id="334">My husband began to speak about this, that you know these people is going to .</sentence><sentence id="335">And I told you are crazy.</sentence><sentence id="336">You are speaking something what is believable.</sentence><sentence id="337">Why?</sentence><sentence id="338">When when people must hear...why not in the press, why not make these organization and to take children, old people, and my husband told yes, this is the sign and when the people is taken for the work, why the children, why the old people, why the the ill people, why everybody?</sentence><sentence id="339">These people will bring the and I thought it is impossible.</sentence><sentence id="340">Don't speak in this way.</sentence><sentence id="341">I wanted not to hear it this way, but...so we get a little breathe, a little better feeling and even we began to very optimist, very...that the war must be finished.</sentence><sentence id="342">I think that uh...as a matter of fact we have heard what is the situation on the on the front and it was far uh after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and we knows that the Russian is coming uh closer and closer to to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and really I know I cannot uh mention what was the front situation, but it was a possibility to think that we had a little uh a little uh future, maybe that we will be the only person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, the only Jews to survive this with our , without without to take to deport...to be to be deported.</sentence><sentence id="343">That or dead.</sentence><sentence id="344">So it was a quite a good feeling till 16th of October.</sentence><sentence id="345">This was a...if | can good remember a Sunday, a nice autumn Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="346">We went out, my husband and I, a little bit strolling on the on the Buda, to get a little fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="347">We uh carved out <span

id="350">It was not announced anything, but everybody had had a feeling this is a strange interesting day.</sentence><sentence id="351">Something will happen.</sentence><sentence id="352">In the same day so in the noontime uh not in the our with whom we changed the the <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span>, he came in and he told you know Mr. Szamosi when something will change, we will change back

id="357">It was to hear it was something that we finished from our <span class="NPIP">side</span>, but in the same time we was with each other, and my husband thought interesting that they are making such a big change.</sentence><sentence id="358">Where is the Hungarian army?</sentence><sentence id="359">How can, how can we change something for such a drastic way.</sentence><sentence id="360">We was coming through the ion the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> what was always uh uh guarded from the Hungarian and from the German army.</sentence><sentence id="361">There was always

our our stroll, but it was a fantastic uh several minutes to hear this, but in our our heart it was not the feeling .</sentence><sentence id="367">We finished.</sentence><sentence id="368">After a...it was...as we we had heard this declaration twice in the radio or three times.</sentence><sentence id="369">Then the radio began to give German march music, German.</sentence><sentence id="370">There was no Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="371">It was German.</sentence><sentence id="372">Then after the music...always very, very military uh music...we had heard voices, a message

these in and it was a little bit interesting for the leaders from this group that here is a person...he was not uh saying convert, and he is making what is necessary to make, so to ask the leadership that I have right to buy these or to bring these in, so it was quite an effective uh beginning to work in this in this chil...children home.</sentence><sentence id="695">So in a very short time my
