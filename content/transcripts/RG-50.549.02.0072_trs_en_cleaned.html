<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="2">This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.</sentence><sentence id="3">This is an interview with Emanuel Mandel, conducted by Nina Ellis, on July 7", 2003, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span>, <span class="REGION">Maryland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">This interview is part of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow-up interview to a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview, conducted with Emanuel Mandel in 1989.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="11">This is tape number one, side A. I'd -- in order to begin, I'd like to ask you if -- if you, in the last 14 years since the interview that I saw took place, is there anything about your experience during the war that you've learned since then, that you'd like to go back and talk about it?</sentence><sentence id="12">Know -- how much you remember, exactly, about your interview, but I'm assuming that you -- it was clear to me that you've been doing research, and finding out more and more about what happened to you, since you were so young.</sentence><sentence id="13">Is there anything that you might want to add to what you already did?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: Let me get to that in one moment, but let me also make a -- not a disclaimer, but a commercial statement in a sense --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="15">Q: Okay.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="19"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0072 ;</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="20">A: -- in that I just want to acknowledge the importance, and I want to say thank you to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> for doing this, because I have believed for some time that the archiving of this information is extremely important.</sentence><sentence id="21">And I've said publicly, privately, that even though every interviewee's information, including mine, may not be earth-shaking, or startling, the fact that it's archived, and the technology is available to do it, is terribly important.</sentence><sentence id="22">How interesting it would be if I go to the -- whatever <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, take out a tape of a Civil War soldier, talking from the Civil War, not a mere reenactment, and we could learn so much.</sentence><sentence id="23">So I just want to acknowledge, and extend my appreciation for whoever sponsors this, and for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> for doing it.</sentence><sentence id="24">I do understand now this has been now going on for maybe 10 years, these second interviews.</sentence><sentence id="25">I really thought it was a brand new idea.</sentence><sentence id="26">But I'm delighted to do it.</sentence><sentence id="27">Let me get to the question that you asked.</sentence><sentence id="28">I don't know if P've learned anything specific.</sentence><sentence id="29">Much of what I know about the Holocaust, I know from -- from memory, and I've said before now, and I'll repeat -- Ill try not to repeat myself too frequently, to say that I was old enough to remember, because my memory apparently works well, and much too young to understand.</sentence><sentence id="30">Which makes yo -- me a survivor whose emotional scars are quite different than people my age, and two, three, four years older, who in fact understood.</sentence><sentence id="31">I thought I was being a little pint sized hero for wearing a yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="32">I didn't think it was a stigma.</sentence><sentence id="33">I couldn't understand the concept of stigma.</sentence><sentence id="34">I mean, I too have, like an adult, that's a good thing.</sentence><sentence id="35">All six year olds want to be like big people.</sentence><sentence id="36">So it isn't so much that I've learned a lot, although I'm sure I've learned certain things about myself, my father, my mother, and others, what I've done the last 14 years different</sentence><sentence id="38">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 4 than before, and it's not because of the interview, was I be -- have become very much more involved in Holocaust kinds of things, in order to make use of the survivors, because we are a dying population, and I can identify for you -- and again, I don't think I did before, that the night that Steven Spielberg -- that's a matter of just a coincidence, received the Academy Award for Schindler, he said that there are, at that time, as I think he said, 350,000 survivors, I guess, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">And I was flabbergasted because in relative terms, it's a very small number.</sentence><sentence id="40">I mean, 350,000 people, and that's a dozen years ago, whenever that was.</sentence><sentence id="41">So there are less today.</sentence><sentence id="42">And I said maybe I need to, in some way be involved, because I'm one of the younger survivors you'll meet -- I'm only 67 years old, do something to archive, to use, to teach, because if we don't, this is an -- this is an irreplaceable commodity.</sentence><sentence id="43">If we don't do what we need to do, after we're gone, it can be done, but differently.</sentence><sentence id="44">A second generation experience is different than the initial experience that those of us who were there, in all the <span class="NPIP">places</span>, can tell.</sentence><sentence id="45">So I've become involved in a number of things, but I think that's the major change, since that time.</sentence><sentence id="46">Not so much what I've learned, but what I've done with it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="75">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="76">Do you want to talk about some of things you've done?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="79">A: Well, I have probably spoken in a -- in a gazillion <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">I've been involved locally with the Jewish [indecipherable] Council, which sponsors an annual Yom HaShoah commemoration that's six, seven, 800 people, attendance thing, and all the largest <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in the community, I've chaired it for the last five years.</sentence><sentence id="81">And I did -- I've been a member of that commission for 15 or 18 years, but I thought maybe I'd like to</sentence><sentence id="83"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0072 deg become more involved.</sentence><sentence id="84">And that involves with some other elements of the Holocaust thing.</sentence><sentence id="85">Serve the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, museum visits, museum volunteering, some other things.</sentence><sentence id="86">I have some connection with the <span class="BUILDING">legislature</span>, as a consequence I've tried to help the council, and the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> be involved with legislators to come to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, or to meet them there, or to speak with them there.</sentence><sentence id="87">These are things I've done, I've -- anecdotally, one of the things I've done is our organizations that have silent auctions, I've been a silent auction museum tour giver in any number of organizations.</sentence><sentence id="88">If you bid on my particular offer, and it's a winning offer, whatever the organization decides, I will in fact take a half a day, and take you and four other people to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and the most interesting group I had once, was a -- a woman, I forget what her organization was, she called, and we arranged, and there were four women, and I, all veterinarians.</sentence><sentence id="89">I don't think they were Jewish, but they were involved in some organization, and they wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, and I was there with four veterinarians.</sentence><sentence id="90">I had never been with that many veterinarians in my life, women or otherwise.</sentence><sentence id="91">Just an interesting combination of people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="106">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="108">A: [ve done that, I have probably been involved in the -- in a -- to a greater degree in the three organizations that are Holocaust organizations in the community.</sentence><sentence id="109">There is the Washington fre -- th-the survivors and friends organization, with which you may be familiar.</sentence><sentence id="110">There is a child survivors organization, which covers more Baltimore/ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, and there's a second generation.</sentence><sentence id="111">And now there is a third generation</sentence><sentence id="113"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0072 deg organization, and I have gotten to know some of the people, I've been involved in some of the meetings, some of the planning, some of the conferences.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="122">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence><sentence id="123">That's quite a lot, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="124">And do you talk with the schoolchildren?</sentence><sentence id="125">Have you done any of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Well, for example, recently there was a cooperative program within the council and Comcast, and the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">Olney theater</span>, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olney</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">And several <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> classes were brought -- several <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span>, and they [indecipherable] 11" grade class, were brought together for a -- an orientation, a talk, a -- a video, and after that they even did projects expressing the Holocaust in art, music and design.</sentence><sentence id="132">And we spoke to those four <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">The next year, there were four other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">These have been things that I've done.</sentence><sentence id="135">There was a training program, for example, for the Jewish Social Service Agency, JESSA, and five years ago, I think it was, when we spent four days, one day a week in four weeks, in a very comprehensive training program for their staff, including a visit to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, which I, as a volunteer put together for them, with a director of the agency, and it was a pretty successful thing involving all of their people, on the assumption that if they deal with Holocaust survivors, they ou-ought to know something about the Holocaust.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: Is it possible for you to summarize what -- how people react to your presentations when you meet with them?</sentence><sentence id="143">People who may not know a lot about the Holocaust?</sentence><sentence id="144">I'm talking about groups aside from survivor groups.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="148">A: React in what way?</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="152"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0072 y</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="153">Q: How do they react?</sentence><sentence id="154">I mean, what do they want to know, what -- what do they not know?</sentence><sentence id="155">What does it --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="156">A: Well -- there are probably at least two major kinds of presentation, and I do one because I'm unable, or whatever to do the other.</sentence><sentence id="157">The -- those presentations which are based in the emotional experience, but as I said to you, my emotional experience at the time was very limited, I didn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="158">So what I do is I do a much more -- not objective, but I guess it's an objective approach to describing what happened, from the eyes of a six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year old kid.</sentence><sentence id="159">The reaction to that often is amazement, to the point, and this is again anecdotal, but I spoke to whatever, the fifth grade <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> class of my <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">And the fifth grade <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school class</span>, one of them, included my grandson at the time.</sentence><sentence id="161">And he asked a question at the end.</sentence><sentence id="162">And he became so kind of involved in the description, he said, "Did you survive?"</sentence><sentence id="163">I'm his grandfather, I mean, he was like trying to ask, how did people survive, so he said to me, "Did you survive?"</sentence><sentence id="164">He's forgotten, I mean, this could have been a movie that I was describing.</sentence><sentence id="165">So the reaction tends to be less visceral in some sense, and more factual, because I tend to present factually, rather than emotionally, for many reasons, including the kind of person I am, and the nature of my experience, of people that I know in the community who are one, two, three, four, five years older than I, whose experience was different as a consequence, they present differently.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="176">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="177">That's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="178">Let's g -- let's go back to your chronology, if you will.</sentence><sentence id="179">It was 1949 when you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with your mother and father.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p><sentence id="187"><span class="BUILDING">USHMM Archives</span> RG-50.549.02*0072 5</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="188">A: Mm, well, my father came in 1948.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="190">Q: Oh, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="192">A: My father -- we were all in, at that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="193"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> happened a few months after my father left.</sentence><sentence id="194">My father came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for two reasons.</sentence><sentence id="195">One stated, and one kind of unstated.</sentence><sentence id="196">The stated reason was, of the seven children, six siblings and my father, two had died in 1930 of causes other than Holocaust, two women, one married, one unmarried.</sentence><sentence id="197">Two brothers were killed during the war.</sentence><sentence id="198">One brother was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, my father, and the seventh child, the oldest, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">My aunt had come here in 1914, in some ways to be with some cousins, to reduce the burden, which was difficult.</sentence><sentence id="200">My grandparents -- my grandfather, I am told -- I never met him, he died before I was born, again for non-Holocaust related reasons, he died 1930.</sentence><sentence id="201">He was not a successful businessman, and they had some very difficult times.</sentence><sentence id="202">He became a -- kind of a county clerk of some sort, because he could read and write, and he knew Hungarian well, besides Yiddish and Jewish things, and it was difficult to make a living.</sentence><sentence id="203">So my aunt came out here.</sentence><sentence id="204">My father wanted to see his surviving sister, whom he had not seen since 1914 when he was eight -- no, he was 10, and she was 14 or 15, or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="205">The other reason was that my father, being a professional cantor all his life, trained as a cantor, not just something he did part time, found that it was very difficult to make a living, because that's one of the things <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> did not need too many of at the time.</sentence><sentence id="206">And he chose to -- he found a way to legally stay, he did, and then in 49, my mother and I came.</sentence><sentence id="207">Now we're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="211">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 .</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="213">What do you remember getting off -- you were at <span class="BUILDING">Idlewild Airport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="214">What do you remember when you came in, and what were your expectations of the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: [had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="216">I honestly had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="217">Remember that being of that age, and at that time, the number of movies that people saw -- I mean, movies were a -- a treat number one, and they were infrequent.</sentence><sentence id="218">And when I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, went to the movie, and I can tell you the names of the <span class="BUILDING">movie theaters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="219">But they were movies from various <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and I didn't -- I didn't have an understanding of what the size of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the dimensions of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, the opportunities of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were, and I'm not sure that's something that a ni -- nine year old would -- well, by that time I'm 13, but even a 13 year old wouldn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="220">My orientation was much more in terms of European recollections of things, and certainly this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> did not appear to be the same way.</sentence><sentence id="221">I was fascinating by -- first I came by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">Now, I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> in a -- what had been a <span class="BUILDING">military airport</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span>, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">engine plane</span>, flew to -- for refueling in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, for refueling in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">Spent overnight in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.85" long="4.35">Brussels</span> took the big bird to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span>, in <span class="REGION">Newfoundland</span>, and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">That was the typical way, but it was by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">My father had come the year before, it took him three weeks, I think, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">But it was just a question of how people traveled.</sentence><sentence id="227">So you arrive at this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and I remember waking up in the morning after an overnight flight, and my first inclination was, as I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span>, was to get out and walk, because the clouds looked like sheep.</sentence><sentence id="228">They looked s -- as solid as rocks.</sentence><sentence id="229">Now I knew that that's not a good idea, and I didn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="230">But it was uneventful flight of --</sentence><sentence id="232">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0072 "0 probably the hop from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shannon</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> must have been 10 hours.</sentence><sentence id="233">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> down, another six.</sentence><sentence id="234">We traveled probably 30 hours all together.</sentence><sentence id="235">But we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">Now, you have to remember that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Idlewild</span>, which we now know as JFK didn't look the same.</sentence><sentence id="237">It was kind of a little <span class="BUILDING">airport</span>, because international flights had not been too common, one because the war had just ended, and two, that was not the kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> hadn't come in, not for another 10 years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
