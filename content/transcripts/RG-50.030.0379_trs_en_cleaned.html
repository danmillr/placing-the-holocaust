<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Hello Maria, welcome to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: Thank you, Joan.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5">Q: Could you tell me the name that you were born with and when and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="7">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="8">I was born December 26, 1918, which in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is Christmas, so I'm a Christmas child.</sentence><sentence id="9">And I was born in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>, which at the time I was born was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, it was newly created <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="10">Before then, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hapsberg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="11">Therefore, my parents spoke German and I was brought up in the German language.</sentence><sentence id="12">My parents eventually learned some Polish but they didn't like the language, so at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the language was German.</sentence><sentence id="13">When I came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I naturally had to learn Polish so at the age of five-and-a-half I entered a <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolo-mier</span> (ph) and I said something in Polish which didn't sound right because it was not my initial language.</sentence><sentence id="14">So the children, including the teacher, started laughing, making fun of me.</sentence><sentence id="15">Naturally, it was quite traumatic.</sentence><sentence id="16">I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying, crying I'Il never go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="17">Well, I did go back.</sentence><sentence id="18">And I've been a student for many, many years later.</sentence><sentence id="19">Interesting enough, when I thought about this experience many years ago, I think it played an important role in my later life choice of Polish as the aid of concentrations <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, strange as it may sound.</sentence><sentence id="20">But there are some dynamics that turned it upright anyway so this was my experience.</sentence><sentence id="21">Actually, I was writing still, I still am, and German and Polish are pretty much my languages even though, although they have both deteriorated.</sentence><sentence id="22">Well, the way I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>, it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, although it wasn't small to the eyes of a child.</sentence><sentence id="23">And later when I visited the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> around, it seemed that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> was big.</sentence><sentence id="24">It's an interesting thing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> that, as I write about it just years later, many years later, that Ta- pan-gee (ph) was an important <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> during the earlier centuries.</sentence><sentence id="25">It's very old.</sentence><sentence id="26">They just celebrated seven hundred and fifty years of the birth of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they say it goes back even further.</sentence><sentence id="27">It was</sentence><sentence id="29">ransacked, it was demolished, it was burned all the way, many times, first by the Tartars, then by the Mongols, or vise-versa, then by the Cossacks.</sentence><sentence id="30">There were endless destruction's and occupations of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">I do not know how far my father's family goes back.</sentence><sentence id="32">The name was Hiersch (ph) and I was born as Matylda Hirsch.</sentence><sentence id="33">My parents wanted to Polonaise my name because that was important for them, I assume, as many parents do, but at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I was called Mattie because my parents spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="34">My father spoke Yiddish with many of his helpers in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and business with some of the people in the community, but my mother was very snobbish about it.</sentence><sentence id="35">She came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called Chad- no-vich (ph).</sentence><sentence id="36"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, it was a very snobbish <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, it was, they called themselves small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="37">Her parents lived there.</sentence><sentence id="38">Actually, I knew only her father because her mother died just before I was born and I was named after her mother.</sentence><sentence id="39">So she had that air of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> about her and she despised <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and she despised <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian town</span> and she despised the Polish people and she didn't want to hear any of the Yiddish language.</sentence><sentence id="40">So, sadly enough, I was brought up in the German language and German was the language, but certainly I spoke Polish later and, with my girlfriends it was always Polish.</sentence><sentence id="41">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> itself, I saw it only forty years ago for the first time I went back.</sentence><sentence id="42">It's a handsome <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> now and as I read some of it's history, it had a rich history, over the centuries it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which a lot of trade was going on.</sentence><sentence id="43">It was on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, so apparently business and trade was very important.</sentence><sentence id="44">My own father came from a whole generation of people who owned the same <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, the same business.</sentence><sentence id="45">This was porcelain and enamel and glass.</sentence><sentence id="46">So we always had the very beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table settings</span> because of their availability.</sentence><sentence id="47">I remember that when my older sister got married, and her husband didn't have a profession, so my father took him into the business.</sentence><sentence id="48">But smartly gave him a special division of it, so he became the importer of chandeliers.</sentence><sentence id="49">It all sounds very, very strange but this was back in our time.</sentence><sentence id="50">My father was Orthodox, my mother came also</sentence><sentence id="52">from a religious family, but not as Orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="53">So there was a little bit cheating, I suppose, but she wore a wig because it was important in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">My father was a follower of Rabbi, he was a Hasidic, a follower of a Rabbi called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wishnitz</span>, he came from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="49.25" long="28.484">Vinnitsa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Apparently he was important in the Rabbinical dynasty and as a child I remember the Wishnitz (ph) Rabbi coming and staying in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I didn't like it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="108">Q: Why?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="110">A: I was crushed by the, by the tone of all these people.</sentence><sentence id="111">He would come, I was very young then, he would come Thursday night for Sukkotbat.</sentence><sentence id="112">So on Thursday night, from the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, he would come escorted by about 200 hus-a-dem (ph), some from his own entourage" and some from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, and because it was dark, it was evening, they would come with, the German name comes back, "Falken", these lightings, strobes carried in the <span class="DLF">street</span>, torches, right?</sentence><sentence id="113">Now it comes back.</sentence><sentence id="114">I sometimes think in German from my childhood years.</sentence><sentence id="115">So they were full of torches and to the dark night of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, which was very Anti-Semitic, although I wasn't exposed to it, I sensed it, and the women would stand on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and greet them, saw them coming in.</sentence><sentence id="116">Since I was so young, to me this was an overwhelming picture and I said I didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="117">They all came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, which was big and he would give him the biggest <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">In front of his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a Gabbai, a Gabbai was the assistant of the man who collected the quitels, and quitels is something that a Jew would write out on a paper asking the Rabbi for advice.</sentence><sentence id="119">So together with the paper I assume that the Rabbi got the money too.</sentence><sentence id="120">I suspect it so.</sentence><sentence id="121">But anyway, the Gabbai stood in front of our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> where the Rabbi held <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and he would see people.</sentence><sentence id="122">Hundreds of people would walk through our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">And to me this was overwhelming, very unhappy kind of experience.</sentence><sentence id="124">I was the youngest and I think on me it worked more than on my sisters because I was already born into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, it made a difference.</sentence><sentence id="125">Since I'm the youngest, my experience of learning <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and otherwise was different than that of my older sisters.</sentence><sentence id="126">It shows you the meaning of history.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: What's the difference in age between you and your sisters?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Five years each, five years each.</sentence><sentence id="153">My older sister was Cyla, C-Y-L-A if you want it, and there was a difference of twenty years between us all.</sentence><sentence id="154">I'm not sure, but something like it.</sentence><sentence id="155">She married Jacob Goldstein, a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> who didn't have money and didn't have much of a profession, but he was the son of a Talmudist and to my father, that was important.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, there was a tremendous wedding, all my sisters had tremendous weddings except me, and their only son, Menek, survived the war.</sentence><sentence id="157">I don't know whether I should go into, she was killed in the last days of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and her husband was transported to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec Extermination Camp</span> in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="158">Anyway, that was my sister, Cyla, and she lived a pretty middle-class, it was pretty prosperous.</sentence><sentence id="159">Her hobby was to do petite work, petite point, and I remember her beautiful pictures on the <span class="DLF">walls</span>, all her own work.</sentence><sentence id="160">This was her hobby.</sentence><sentence id="161">She was well known in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, she had girlfriends and when their son was born, it was a great thing because he was the only boy in the family, until then we had nothing but girls.</sentence><sentence id="162">Now the next sister was Frieda, her name, my sister Cyla, was Cyla Goldstein, that was her name and her son is Menek Goldstein, and he survived.</sentence><sentence id="163">My next sister was Frieda.</sentence><sentence id="164">She was very beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="165">Frieda married a man who was a cousin, a second cousin.</sentence><sentence id="166">He came from Cal-es-sa-bot (ph), from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resort town</span>, very well known spot in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="167">His father was a brother of my father, but that was of a different mother so they were step-brothers.</sentence><sentence id="168">And therefore, it was permitted for them to marry, even so, they worried that they're offspring may suffer from it and be mentally retarded, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="169">She ain't, she's a doctor of eye diseases.</sentence><sentence id="170">She turned out to be okay.</sentence><sentence id="171">But this wedding, I remember vaguely.</sentence><sentence id="172">I only remember my dress, I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="173">It was the most beautiful dress I've ever had.</sentence><sentence id="174">And their wedding was held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislawow</span>, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> a little bit bigger than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">This is somehow, I still remember.</sentence><sentence id="176">No, she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span> (ph) which means she lived in a privileged <span class="NPIP">place</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span> (ph) was a beautiful international spot and</sentence><sentence id="178">he was making a good living, he had many patients so it was sort of high life.</sentence><sentence id="179">Anyway, in 1938 Hitler occupied . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: Wait, you've missed a sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: Oh, you want to go this way, sure.</sentence><sentence id="212">Then the younger sister, also five years younger, is Frania.</sentence><sentence id="213"><span class="COUNTRY">Frania</span> survived.</sentence><sentence id="214">By the way, my sister Frieda survived and in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> they got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dorosig</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">She's still alive, she's unfortunately in a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> now and her husband died a few years ago.</sentence><sentence id="216">Then, there's my sister, Frania.</sentence><sentence id="217">She's alive, she lives in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, her husband was killed, and they're child, Laszek, Alex, was about three years old in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and miraculously he survived and he lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">Though she later re-married and her second husband adopted him so his name is Alex Gitterman.</sentence><sentence id="219">And then comes me.</sentence><sentence id="220">I was the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="221">No, my sisters still had a background of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hapsberg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, although Frania was very young then.</sentence><sentence id="222">In 1916 I believe, my parents ran from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> because of the war.</sentence><sentence id="223">And they came to, they ran to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sigit</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marmorosk</span> I think, which is where Wiesel comes from, which was a border of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">There were large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish communities</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="225">My father went into hiding there because the Austrian army was busy trying to find men to fight their war, they needed my father naturally, so they lived a very, very difficult kind of life.</sentence><sentence id="226">I think they lived in Mon-room-a-vot (ph).</sentence><sentence id="227">And at that time I still had another sister, whom I never met, she died right there.</sentence><sentence id="228">She was between Cyla and Frieda and I think she was fourteen years old when she developed a serious appendix condition and there was no time to get to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, she died right in my father's arms, I understand.</sentence><sentence id="229">Some things that I heard about years later, my parents didn't talk about it, but it was always in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and I suspected that something happened there, but I say, I was born after, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="230">Only about ten years ago, walking in the beautiful woods of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, my mother's younger brother told me about it.</sentence><sentence id="231">They talked about her in some ways, her name was Yetta, but it was hushed-hushed and it was never quite</sentence><sentence id="233">there.</sentence><sentence id="234">I'm sure that my childhood was spent in a family which suffered from depression, yet it was not, it was covered over.</sentence><sentence id="235">Probably because my father was a Hasidic and in the Hasidic tradition, joy and pain are mixed.</sentence><sentence id="236">So, I think so, in looking back at it that my childhood was very complex because it was a Hasidic family and my mother was, had that air of a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> with more civilization and the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in which I lived was Polish Anti-Semitic, so I would think I have the strength of all of that in some way in my own personality.</sentence><sentence id="237">But, I remember there were times of when my mother would cry and this was the anniversary, not only of the deaths of my sister and her daughter, but the death of her mother.</sentence><sentence id="238">They all lived in that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sigit</span> there and my grandmother, her mother, died of a heart attack, apparently still a young woman, so for my mother it must have been a horrible loss.</sentence><sentence id="239">She would go to visit her father later, she once took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czernowitz</span> and this I remember.</sentence><sentence id="240">These things are very vague in my memory because they were not talked about, but it was there in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and from time to time I would overhear something.</sentence><sentence id="241">There's a good possibility I tried to protect myself from the pain too.</sentence><sentence id="242">So I grew up in this family in which I was extremely important because only years back later, I could understand the importance of me.</sentence><sentence id="243">Because I had to replace all these losses, I'm sure.</sentence><sentence id="244">So, I was an extremely overprotected child to the extent that I hated it, | was embarrassed by it.</sentence><sentence id="245">When I sneezed, there was immediately a doctor around me.</sentence><sentence id="246">When I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and I forgot my breakfast, somebody from the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> would knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> of my class and bring me the breakfast.</sentence><sentence id="247">My mother was extremely anxious about me and my parents over-protected me in a way which probably helped them some way but also did not.</sentence><sentence id="248">So my sister Frania, I think, was a little bit jealous, I never knew about it because no matter what I did was fine.</sentence><sentence id="249">Which means I wasn't prepared for the hardships of life that later came my way.</sentence><sentence id="250">I was a child who could never do wrong.</sentence><sentence id="251">And they thought I was bright and I did extremely well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">To the end of my sister because she didn't do so well, she was pretty and</sentence><sentence id="254">she liked to go with boys and she wasn't so interested in studies.</sentence><sentence id="255">I was, all of my, the grades were always above "A", you know?</sentence><sentence id="256">Once I brought a "B", I cried for weeks!</sentence><sentence id="257">I got a "B" in mathematics which was unbelievable because it was always "A's in other subjects and my preferred subject was Polish literature, romantic Polish literature.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Did this create a problem between you and your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="311">I was a child who was smart.</sentence><sentence id="312">I don't think I was pretty, my sisters were pretty, my two sisters, Frania and Frieda were very pretty, but I never experienced a sense that I wasn't okay.</sentence><sentence id="313">Looks didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="314">I was accepted.</sentence><sentence id="315">I say I was, scholastically, I did so extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="316">My sister, Frania, still remembers with pain that when my mother would go to the teachers for the periodic visitations, they would say, how come your daughter, Frania, cannot do that well? [</sentence><sentence id="317">I'm sure it didn't do her any good, but that's what she remembers.</sentence><sentence id="318">But she was very pretty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="328">Q: Tell me a little bit about your violin playing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="330">A: Oh, how do you know this?</sentence><sentence id="331">As, I must have been six years old, eight years old, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="332">My parents hired a violin teacher for Frania and myself.</sentence><sentence id="333">And we didn't like it.</sentence><sentence id="334">But anyway, I mastered in playing the Hatikva so every Saturday night, many guests, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was full of guests always.</sentence><sentence id="335">I think I still carry this tradition to some extent.</sentence><sentence id="336">We had to play, the ha-tic-fa (ph) had to play, a few other things.</sentence><sentence id="337">It was not something that I really liked very much.</sentence><sentence id="338">Probably I couldn't identify with the teacher.</sentence><sentence id="339">We also had a teacher of Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="340">Darlis Bate (ph).</sentence><sentence id="341">And him we hated!</sentence><sentence id="342">He was a poor, old Jew who didn't know to teach.</sentence><sentence id="343">My sister and I use to bribe him, give him a zloty and he would go, he would leave earlier.</sentence><sentence id="344">Unfortunately, we didn't learn much so until these days, I cannot read any of the Hebrew text and I'm sorry about it, I wish I could.</sentence><sentence id="345">But this was my mother, my mother looked away because it wasn't as important to her and as girls, we were not suppose to learn much of the Hebrew text.</sentence><sentence id="346">We never was suppose to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> until you're married so I never</sentence><sentence id="348">went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because when I married, the war was on and I've never gone to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">I remember, right after the war, there was some gathering of the American soldiers and I was included and it was in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span>, I'm not even sure, but occasionally I go now to religious service but a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is not part of my life and this is because of my background.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="485">Q: This time away from, did this make all of you much closer than you would have been?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="487">A: We were a very close family, always a very close family.</sentence><sentence id="488">Close in the family was a prescription I'm sure of my family, probably because it's a Jewish tradition but probably because they had suffered losses.</sentence><sentence id="489">So, to my parents, the business was important to my father and he was a very good businessman, family was all that mattered, always.</sentence><sentence id="490">And to us it still does.</sentence><sentence id="491">Now we have fragments of the family but family is still very important to us, to all of us.</sentence><sentence id="492">So I was brought up with this, I was suffocated by it, I really didn't like that much closeness.</sentence><sentence id="493">And with my colleagues who had more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, and I always wanted more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="494">My whole traveling in my life was always getting more <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>.</sentence><sentence id="495">These were the consequences of that emotional overcrowding, extremely so.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="505">Q: Were there political discussions that you remember as you grew up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="507">A: By the way, yes.</sentence><sentence id="508">I wasn't involved politically until sometime later in my <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> years.</sentence><sentence id="509">Yes, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>, like most <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, had a lot of political divisions among the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="510">There was the Main Zionist, and there were Left Zionist, the Communist, the Socialist, the Liberals, the Divisionists, you name it.</sentence><sentence id="511">Amazing, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> which only had 40,000 people, half of them were Jewish, they had about a few Jewish newspapers.</sentence><sentence id="512">It was a highly literate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">I wasn't among them because my parents protection some how or other excluded me.</sentence><sentence id="514">My parents protection and my need for the Polish patriotism somehow excluded me much from it, as strange as it is.</sentence><sentence id="515">But I had liberal ideas.</sentence><sentence id="516">My parents, my father worried about it, that I was going very liberal at one point.</sentence><sentence id="517">But I didn't join a particular group.</sentence><sentence id="518">However, there were many, many groups.</sentence><sentence id="519">Most of the Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> as in most of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were poor.</sentence><sentence id="520">There were people</sentence><sentence id="522">1 who were really poor and then there was the middle class, upper middle class, and a very few who were really extremely rich.</sentence><sentence id="523">There must have been, but in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> the middle class and upper middle class were the rich people.</sentence><sentence id="524">I remember, I still have a great pain when I think about the poverty in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">My first memory is of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">water carriers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="526">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was on top of the business and there were wide <span class="DLF">staircases</span>.</sentence><sentence id="527">And the water carriers, all whom were Jewish, they were carrying up the water, big cans, because there was no other way of getting water.</sentence><sentence id="528">The water came from a main <span class="DLF">fountain</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, on <span class="DLF">Mokra Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="529"><span class="DLF">Mokra Street</span> is well known because there are survivors like Dov Noi, who's well know, he comes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">MokraStreet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="530">Many people lived on MokraStreet.</sentence><sentence id="531">It was the poorest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and there was a big <span class="DLF">fountain</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">water carriers</span> possibly were on the lowest rank of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="532">And they carried that water upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="533">I remember once, on a very cold day, and Kolomyja being in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, a cold, cold climate.</sentence><sentence id="534">I asked my mother, how come this man has ice on his hands?Doesn't he like to wear gloves?</sentence><sentence id="535">This was my awakening, that some people didn't have money for gloves.</sentence><sentence id="536">The poverty was everywhere and when I think of that poverty, I think of them like of the closest family because there was no right for them to suffer such an end as these people did.</sentence><sentence id="537">They really never had any life.</sentence><sentence id="538">There was a lot of stigma about being poor and there was a lot of sukkotme.</sentence><sentence id="539">In my <span class="BUILDING">High School</span>, which was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasium</span>, it was one of the sets of <span class="BUILDING">gymnasiums</span>, it was a chain of, called Zyowskie Towarzystowo szkoty Ludoweii Sreduig, it was a chain of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Gymnasiums</span> established in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, which was run by the Jewish parents, who established it.</sentence><sentence id="540">They paid for it, it was extremely expensive.</sentence><sentence id="541">Somehow or other, because there was no <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> for Jewish girls after <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span>, ten parents got together and established it.</sentence><sentence id="542">My parents and nine others.</sentence><sentence id="543">And they took in one parent who didn't have money.</sentence><sentence id="544">Their name was Neiman and she was Sophia Neiman.</sentence><sentence id="545">I still remember the pain and the stigma and the sense of sukkotme.</sentence><sentence id="546">She wore</sentence><sentence id="548">2 clothes which came from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, which means she had a coat which was red.</sentence><sentence id="549">Only American children wore red coat, we never wore red coat.</sentence><sentence id="550">In <span class="BUILDING">High School</span> you wore navy.</sentence><sentence id="551">And this was such a stigmatic thing.</sentence><sentence id="552">And another thing I remember is that <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">school building</span>, was an old Jew who was selling some food, potatonik, and you could buy it with butter or with margarine.</sentence><sentence id="553">Margarine was half price of butter, and she would buy the margarine potato.</sentence><sentence id="554">All these things stay with me because it was so unjust.</sentence><sentence id="555">Well, of the ten students, we were ten students and ten teachers.</sentence><sentence id="556">All teachers were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="557">They came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, from the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="558">We had to be more pious than the Pope in achieving our accreditation because the commission would come down from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and we had to be good.</sentence><sentence id="559">So we had ten teachers to ten students.</sentence><sentence id="560">And of the ten students, miraculously, unbelievably, all survived!</sentence><sentence id="561">All the teachers were killed.</sentence><sentence id="562">I wanted to bring you pictures, some how I couldn't get it down from my <span class="DLF">wall</span>, it was heavy.</sentence><sentence id="563">But I be jumping a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="564">This was the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> years and it was all Jewish students, all Jewish teachers.</sentence><sentence id="565">It was considered a high level <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="566">It is described in the book about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by Dr. Sylvia Helliard, you may know about it, called "An Air of Destruction".</sentence><sentence id="567">She has quite a bit about these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="632">Q: Were you all close, all the students, including the one who was somewhat stigmatized or what about that one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="634">A: Well, she was not stigmatized by us, we just felt the stigma.</sentence><sentence id="635">I felt the stigma.</sentence><sentence id="636">For reason, I don't know why, I still don't know why I identified with the underdog.</sentence><sentence id="637">Some way or other I assume it eventually led me to social work, but I didn't know the origins of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="642">Q: But you, of course, were living in very privileged ways?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="644">A: I lived by comparison, I'm sure here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> it now would not be because of it, but by comparison with the others, and I had a lot of pain about it.</sentence><sentence id="645">Probably was a part of my rebelling against my parents, whatever it was that came into it, that I became very liberal.</sentence><sentence id="646">The pain about witnessing so much poverty still stays with me whenever I think about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="647">But anyway.. So, this was the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> years, we had to study a lot.</sentence><sentence id="648">We had to study Latin, eight years of Latin, that's a lot of Latin.</sentence><sentence id="649">We had to study, the only thing we didn't like is religion.</sentence><sentence id="650">Of course because the teacher wasn't great.</sentence><sentence id="651">I had marvelous teachers of Polish literature, one of them</sentence><sentence id="653">3 became my role model.</sentence><sentence id="654">I think she played an important part in my choice of this profession later.</sentence><sentence id="655">We had a teacher of German literature, we had mathematics, which was not my subject somehow or other.</sentence><sentence id="656">But I couldn't afford to have a "B" ever so my parents hired a tutor.</sentence><sentence id="657">I fell in love with the tutor, my first adolescent crush, and a learned it and I passed exams very well.</sentence><sentence id="658">Then we had a lot of <span class="BUILDING">gym</span>.</sentence><sentence id="659">I wasn't great in <span class="BUILDING">gym</span>, just passing.</sentence><sentence id="660">What else did we have?</sentence><sentence id="661">Certainly geography and history, history was always my great interest and remained so.</sentence><sentence id="662">Geography and history.</sentence><sentence id="663">In the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>, I had to decide, study was history.</sentence><sentence id="664">I believe that you don't understand people without history.</sentence><sentence id="665">In those days, I didn't understand it but now I teach my students that you do not understand people without knowing history of their people.</sentence><sentence id="666">Well, we'll come to it later, but anyway, I consider it as part of the web of the personality, historic events.</sentence><sentence id="667">Those days I did not understand it this way, just liked history.</sentence><sentence id="668">Every single strut in the <span class="DLF">roadway</span>, you know, I had to memorize.</sentence><sentence id="669">We had to, we had to decide a in <span class="BUILDING">High School</span> and I was very good at it because I memorized Mickiewicz, Schen- kavitch (ph), Krasinski, these were the very famous, and later came the positivists and I was really, this was my life!</sentence><sentence id="670">It still is, reading, I'm still an addict in reading.</sentence><sentence id="671">I don't remember now because my mind doesn't work well but in those days I absorbed it all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="700">Q: What attracted you to the positivists?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="702">A: It was lit, oh sure, it was after the romantics who needed a pause!</sentence><sentence id="703"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orzeszkowa</span>, Aun-jus-kov-a (ph).</sentence><sentence id="704">The other day, they had a few months ago, they had a film festival of Polish movies and there was a marvelous, marvelous movie of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orzeszkowa</span>, I forgot what it was, it was fantastically well done, but the positivists.</sentence><sentence id="705">And then when I came to the, this was all in <span class="BUILDING">High School</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">It's amazing, I didn't have any conflict with Poles at that point.</sentence><sentence id="707">I studied so many years in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, we were totally isolated.</sentence><sentence id="708">We didn't experience it.</sentence><sentence id="711">4 I didn't know, my father had some customers who were Polish, but I didn't have any contact.</sentence><sentence id="712">So, anti-Semitism was nothing that was experienced personally except that it wasn't it, but you knew it was there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="724">Q: Did your parents talk about it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="726">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="727">I knew that my father would bribe the tax accountants, when they came, the tax man.</sentence><sentence id="728">He would send them fantastic sets of porcelain for Christmas, as I remember, because of our discussion what to choose for these people, so they were bribed.</sentence><sentence id="729">He would give some of them discounts, I know, that later saved my life in strange ways.</sentence><sentence id="730">The Ukrainians were very poor.</sentence><sentence id="731">This was a Polish regime and Ukrainians were both illiterate and poor.</sentence><sentence id="732">They were peasants, they would come into <span class="BUILDING">store</span> barefoot, I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="733">And they would always buy dishes which were considered very inferior, fiance (ph), ceramic.</sentence><sentence id="734">They were painted.</sentence><sentence id="735">They would buy big dishes, painted, big dishes for soup, or whatever else.</sentence><sentence id="736">But the fine porcelain was always for the Polish and for some of the Jewish families too.</sentence><sentence id="737">But my father did more than this, handling the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, but from all over they came.</sentence><sentence id="738">It was an established business for the Province.</sentence><sentence id="739">And the provincial peasants were very, very many.</sentence><sentence id="740">So we got both the Ukrainian peasants would come in and the Polish people were the aristocracy, in a way.</sentence><sentence id="741">And then there were Jewish people with money.</sentence><sentence id="742">This was the clientele and there were many helpers in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and that's where I picked up Yiddish because they spoke Yiddish to a very large extent.</sentence><sentence id="743">We had a bookkeeper who survived the war, we had my brother-in-law, my older sister's, her husband later joined and he had the presentation of chandeliers and enamel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bath tubs</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="762">Q: Enamel what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="764">A: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bath tubs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Tubs</span> for the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="766">This was all new because there was no way of having any, water didn't come into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> so you had to pour it, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bath tubs</span> we had for that luxury of taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="767">And he was doing very well this way but it was part of the business.</sentence><sentence id="768">So that's where, Yiddish you could hear in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, they spoke Yiddish, these boys.</sentence><sentence id="769">One of them survived, I met him after the war, I couldn't believe it, but, the rest were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="770">I remember seeing them over the, over in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="773">5 But, I, so I was sort of isolated or protected from actual confrontation with anti-Semitism, but as I said, it was always in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="774">For instance, on Yom Kipper my parents would go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, naturally, we girls stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="775">And we always barricaded ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="776">We were afraid always to stand in the <span class="DLF">window</span> or on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> was a big part of our life.</sentence><sentence id="777">We lived on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> called Kol-<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">soy-oi</span> (ph), you could see people walk back and forth and my mother was very orientated towards clothes, she was critical of this, this dress is too long and this is too short and this is too bright and so on, but on Yom Kipper night, some of these nights it was forbidden for us to show our faces, this I remembered.</sentence><sentence id="778">We worried, although we never experienced it, that some of the Polish or Ukrainian goons will come and knock out <span class="DLF">windows</span> so there was this sense of panic all the time.</sentence><sentence id="779">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there were so many Jews, half of the population was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="780">You could see the difference.</sentence><sentence id="781">Suddenly it was very dark, it was very quiet, all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were closed, most <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> belonged to the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="782">No body moved, nothing moved.</sentence><sentence id="783">And then you always thought, somebody will come, knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, knock out the <span class="DLF">window</span>, it happened occasionally but I myself did not experience this.</sentence><sentence id="784">But I do recall the feeling of some anxiety, perhaps even panic, that it might happen.</sentence><sentence id="785">So I say, I knew about it, but not in a personal way.</sentence><sentence id="786">Yom Kipper was very difficult, we all passed it, I didn't after a certain age, but Yom Kipper I remember as it was dark in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="787">There was a very severe fast.</sentence><sentence id="788">The breaking of the fast, people were very tired or slowly coming out of <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, they were praying all day there.</sentence><sentence id="789">This I remember with a great deal of pain.</sentence><sentence id="790">The Klezmar would come, to pray for us, a happy, ah, these people were very poor.</sentence><sentence id="791">These are older Jews.</sentence><sentence id="792">Very poor, and they would go from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="793">It was my job, because I was the youngest at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and because I was there while my parents had to come from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, to give them some food to break the fast.</sentence><sentence id="794">I remember as a child carrying that tray of honey cake.</sentence><sentence id="795">And they would pray, they would pray and then they would go, sometimes they came back later at dinner time.</sentence><sentence id="796">I still mourn these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klezmar</span> because they were so poor.</sentence><sentence id="797">It was so</sentence><sentence id="799">6 wrong that a night like that, after fast, they had to go and pray.</sentence><sentence id="800">The Klas-mas(ph) music has not survived, the type of pain when I hear, it's not good, it's not authentic enough for me.</sentence><sentence id="801">I must be honest, there's very few people who remember how it was.</sentence><sentence id="802">They played in short sleeved outfits, I can't even, Perlman plays.</sentence><sentence id="803">He's doing it well I suppose but he's not good enough for me because I remember the authentic players.</sentence><sentence id="804">Who could teach these young people here, they all went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="805">This is the story of the Klezmar in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, they always played at weddings, the weddings for my family were very big, and none of them survived from what I know.</sentence><sentence id="806">Anyway, it was not right that people who have suffered so much poverty and so much indignity should ever have to end up this way.</sentence><sentence

defend Stalin and everywhere we will be the victors.</sentence><sentence id="1433">So, it had a mesmerizing quality for some reason because I was in conflict.</sentence><sentence id="1434">But I did go back to finish my studies.</sentence><sentence id="1435">The <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was totally different by then.</sentence><sentence id="1436">By the way, I was married by, this was 1940, I was just married by then.</sentence><sentence id="1437">Well, come back to my wedding for a minute, it was already a very quiet wedding.</sentence><sentence id="1438">I never wanted a wedding in a white gown, I was a very feminist kind of a woman, liberal kind of a women.</sentence><sentence id="1439">I was not interested in all these trappings of the bourgeoisie, which was very much the bad and good part of my background, mainly through my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1440">So I always dreamed that I'll just escape with my husband or I'll have a very small wedding, but anyway when the time came it was, the Soviets had just come in at that point and I was married, I can't remember the month which is insane, but I know it was 1940.</sentence><sentence id="1441">It was the year when I was just about to graduate.</sentence><sentence id="1442">The Rabbi of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a close friend of my father, Rabbi Lowe (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1443">His nephew is the chief Rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="1444">The other nephew was chief counsel of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, I knew both of them, I met them later.</sentence><sentence

young.</sentence><sentence id="1448">So the outfit for my wedding was a nice little navy suit and flat-heel shoes and a little veil, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1449">The wedding was in our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">parents home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1450">There were hardly any guests, the Soviets had just come in and the business was already taken over by the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="1451">My father kept saying that he cannot give me much a dowry because of the war, because the Soviets have taken over everything, but after the war he will reimburse me for it, P'll get more dowry than any of the other girls, and all the girls got good dowries.</sentence><sentence id="1452">And I didn't think of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dowry</span> at all, to me this was all very uninteresting.</sentence><sentence id="1453">All I remember that, the day of the wedding, later we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went back to study and, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph), and sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I wore that wedding band

bands, you're both children!</sentence><sentence id="1457">He looked very young too, strange as it all sounds now.</sentence><sentence id="1458">But we finished our studies and the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was a totally different <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1459">The Soviets have changed it totally.</sentence><sentence id="1460">While anti-Semitism was somewhat there, it certainly was there, it was not official but there are no more Jewish students in my department.</sentence><sentence id="1461">I mean, there was no question in what I mixed with others.</sentence><sentence id="1462">What I recall was extremely cold winter of 1940.</sentence><sentence id="1463">The Soviets suddenly did not have any steam anymore, everything was just taken away, including the steam, how they managed that I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1464">But whatever they could put their eyes on was taken back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I recall going to the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span>, we were involved in opera, and seeing the Russian ladies in nightgowns because they thought these were evening gowns, and I recall in our, when they took our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> they removed everything so my father still removed some dishes for bartering later which helped us for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="1466">The Soviets nationalized the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, actually local people who became communist, who were communist, but now became very important officials, they came to help the Soviet soldiers to nationalize the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">For my father it was a terrible tragedy because to him the business was his life to a very large extent and suddenly he was without anything.</sentence><sentence id="1468">The same happened to my father-in-law, his was also nationalized by the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="1469">To these people, they suddenly became old, and they were really not older at that point but everything was taken away from them, they felt.</sentence><sentence id="1470">So, the study was very different.</sentence><sentence id="1471">I had my final exams, they had to be in the Russian language.</sentence><sentence id="1472">We all had to study from the green book, I remember under my arm, and every student had it under their arm, every University student has this green book.</sentence><sentence id="1473">Very cheap paper in green cover, it was called the korr-up-tik qual for Bolshovitski Party (ph), which means The Short Course of the Bolshevik Party and was full of propaganda which I didn't realize at that time that it was propaganda, but it was about Stalin and it was about the Revolution.</sentence><sentence id="1474">One chapter I liked very much was the Marxist dialectic philosophy, it was very well written.</sentence><sentence id="1475">It seemed to have some, no, actually the Hagalien (ph) dialectic philosophy, it made sense.</sentence><sentence id="1476">It had some large expressions to be a lot of propaganda.</sentence><sentence id="1477">But we had to study every page and every word of it and the final exam, when they examined me in Polish literature, I had to talk in Russian.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I mastered the language very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1479">I forgot it very quickly too, you know I hardly know any.</sentence><sentence id="1480">But this was a</sentence><sentence id="1482">9 year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph), the final year.</sentence><sentence id="1483">I was a newly wedded woman, my parents were depressed over what happened, what was going on, they were forever feared that they may be deported, that the Russians would deport them.</sentence><sentence id="1484">At one point, they actually would go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from time to time, at one point they came to take my parents away.</sentence><sentence id="1485">They always did it in the middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="1486">They were classified as bourgeois and this was a very bad certification and, in the middle of the night they came always with their rifles, rifling at the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1487">We always were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="1488">And they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to take them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1489">I recall 1 was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at that point and my sisters was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at that point, and we ran to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1490">It was a lot of bribes to get them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1491">I wish we didn't, but that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1492">The bribes were always vodka and chof-socks (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1493">Chof-socks (ph) were watches, they loved watches.</sentence><sentence id="1494">The Soviets had absolutely nothing, it's unbelievable, how they took everything, taken back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1495">For the first time they saw goods, which they haven't seen.</sentence><sentence id="1496">We didn't realize how the revolution had changed life there in those politics in poverty, unless among the highest officials, I suppose.</sentence><sentence id="1497">So, they always ordered leather coats and when they ordered leather coats, they had to be to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> because they figured when they go back and the winter is cold, they will cut and make a pair of boots, this was .</sentence><sentence id="1498">So, chof-socks (ph) and leather coats and our fine porcelain, all of it went somewhere with the Russian families eventually back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1499">This was the Soviets, but I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then they didn't permit me to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph), didn't permit me or my husband, because we were categorize as bourgeois.</sentence><sentence id="1500">And the Soviet law was that if you were in this category, you weren't quite an animal in Socialism but you were somewhere not to be trusted so you had to live fifty miles away from a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1501">Everybody wanted to live in a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so they punished us.</sentence><sentence id="1502">Instead of taking us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> like they wanted to take my parents, who were considered useless, they figured two young people, these professionals, will be useful.</sentence><sentence id="1503">So the law was that you had to move fifty miles away from Re- volf (ph) and there were these centers.</sentence><sentence id="1504">They had a very bright idea, good idea, is to open up <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and <span class="BUILDING">pharmacies</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> of the <span class="REGION">Polish Ukraine</span>, which had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1505">There was never a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, never a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, never a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, and the Soviets had a network of these things, very smart, the Poles never give them any credit for it.</sentence><sentence id="1506">But they did, so they opened up a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in</sentence><sentence id="1508">0 a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called Glen-na-novaria (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1509">You never heard of it, I never heard of it.</sentence><sentence id="1510">It was a real loss, it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in where there was no <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1511">When a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, your shoe got stuck right in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1512">It had a name, mud was a part of the name, so this is where they sent us to work.</sentence><sentence id="1513">My husband, they wanted to open a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, how did they open a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1514">They took from the <span class="BUILDING">Russian church</span>, from the <span class="BUILDING">parochial house</span>, they took the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they opened a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1515">My husband opened the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> and me, they wanted to teach in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and, because I wasn't prepared to teach young children, I was prepared to teach at <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, I had a Masters Degree by then, my gis-trof-o- sovisia (ph) which was a high Degree.</sentence><sentence id="1516">So I was not versed in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> or anything, so they said I could be an assistant to my husband.</sentence><sentence id="1517">I learned how to make ca-go-cheekie (ph), was a little medication against headaches.</sentence><sentence id="1518">And I would wrap it.</sentence><sentence id="1519">Very often at night we heard them, heard the Soviet soldiers knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> with the rifle.</sentence><sentence id="1520">Each time we were prepared they would take us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1521">What they wanted were condoms.</sentence><sentence id="1522">In the middle of the night, they would rifle at the <span class="DLF">door</span> for condoms.</sentence><sentence id="1523">This was 1940.</sentence><sentence id="1524">I thought we were lucky to have jobs, we had enough food.</sentence><sentence id="1525">There were three Jewish families, us, a Jewish doctor from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who was somehow or other came there and opened a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, it was all public works, and a Jewish teacher from Ha-riza (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1526">That's where all your Ukrainian peasants, everybody was illiterate there, absolutely illiterate.</sentence><sentence id="1527">So the three of us, sometimes they played cards, I was reading books always, but anyway, one day we went to vacation and my father, you know, was so desperate about once more to stand behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pharmacy counter</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1528">Once more to be an upper taker.</sentence><sentence id="1529">So with a great deal of difficulty, we arranged for him to come to our <span class="NPIP">place</span> in Glen-na-novaria (ph) for two weeks vacation and we would go to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1530">It took us a lot of work to arrange that exchange.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Well, it happened.</sentence><sentence id="1532">We went there, <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, we stayed in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for two weeks and my father and mother-in-law went to our little <span class="NPIP">place</span> and took over the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> to the greatest joy for this old man.</sentence><sentence id="1533">And we were suppose to, after two weeks vacations we were suppose to go back.</sentence><sentence id="1534">And it was the 21st of June, 1941, and you know the rest of the story.</sentence><sentence id="1535">We didn't expect any of it.</sentence><sentence id="1536">We said good-bye to my parents, we had railway tickets to go the next day back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph) and from there by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> to go to Glen-na-novaria (ph) and, in the middle of the night, I hear a lot of noise.</sentence><sentence id="1537">I look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>,</sentence><sentence id="1539">1 it was one in the morning, I see Soviet women and children being put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1540">I woke my husband, I say, they must be going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1541">But it seemed to be so noisy and so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, middle of the night.</sentence><sentence id="1542">I opened the radio and here Hitler's voice comes across.</sentence><sentence id="1543">Today I declared war on Bolshevism and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1544">And I knew things were very bad.</sentence><sentence id="1545">The first thing in the morning, we ran to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to get to that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1546">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> did not run anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1547">Nothing for civilians.</sentence><sentence id="1548">We were stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>, his parents were stuck in that little <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1549">Two weeks later we got a card, they were both shot.</sentence><sentence id="1550">The Germans walked into the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, they were renounced as Jews and they were shot.</sentence><sentence id="1551">This was the end of my husband's parents.</sentence><sentence id="1552">We were stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and first the Hungarians came to cover our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I remember them wearing these very high hats with feathers.</sentence><sentence id="1554">They didn't do much harm at that point yet.</sentence><sentence id="1555">Somehow or other I recall a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of children, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with children.</sentence><sentence id="1556">I had no idea who these children were, but the children, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was covered but you could hear cries.</sentence><sentence id="1557">We were living then at the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of my parents and I remember my father said to me and my sister, my sister had run away from Nova-som (ph), from the <span class="REGION">western part</span> where the Germans had been already for two years, she came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1558">And the Russians first were looking for her to send her to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> but anyway she got out of it and the Hungarians were there and my father said, bring the children a little hot water, it was a cold day.</sentence><sentence id="1559">So we run with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">china</span> of hot water and we hear the whimper of the children and suddenly shots come.</sentence><sentence id="1560">They were directed at us, at my sister and myself.</sentence><sentence id="1561">I remember we threw this hot water, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">china</span>, on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1562">This was my first confrontation with real terror.</sentence><sentence id="1563">But the Hungarians by and way were pretty innocent at the beginning, a least we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="1564">Within a few weeks, the Germans marched in.</sentence><sentence id="1565">And now I know from history but those days I didn't know that right in the back of the soldiers came the SS.</sentence><sentence id="1566">They always were out and we didn't know the difference between an SS and a soldier and everything has been blamed on the SS but I now know that the soldiers were indistinguisukkotble from the SS because they participated as much.</sentence><sentence id="1567">But anyway, everyday there was a new directive, a new poster.</sentence><sentence id="1568">Today the Jews have to register and tonight the Jews have to observe curfew, and then Jews had to deliver all the gold and silver and then Jews have to deliver all the fur coats.</sentence><sentence id="1569">And I remember standing in a long, long <span class="DLF">line</span> on a very cold day, shivering and</sentence><sentence id="1571">2 delivering fur

coat.</sentence><sentence id="1574">Anyway, with these two fur coats I stood in <span class="DLF">line</span>, we all stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> to deliver to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1575">And I recall coming to the <span class="DLF">window</span>, the German official, and he would register my name and address and the fur coat, the length of the fur coat, what it was made of.</sentence><sentence id="1576">One was a tweed lined with beaver, the other was a sealskin coat, and he gave me a receipt of it and I figured, well, if after the Winter passes I'll get it back, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1577">My <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ivory tables</span> endless.</sentence><sentence id="1578">And then came the ax-e-on-a (ph), the activists.</sentence><sentence id="1579">All these names, we didn't know, we called them ax-e-on-a (ph) because the Germans called it ax-e-on-a (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1580">The raids.</sentence><sentence id="1581">There was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet.</sentence><sentence id="1582">I remember in the beginning, one of the raids was suddenly we saw people being dragged with ropes around their bodies.</sentence><sentence id="1583">This was the action against the intellectuals, the doctors.</sentence><sentence id="1584">We knew the Jewish doctor so well.</sentence><sentence id="1585">This was a diversion, when sometime in 1940 when the Soviets were there, I was an assured vacation, Passover vacation at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1586">We were married then and my husband left at 6:00 in the morning I was suppose to take a later <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I do not remember why.</sentence><sentence id="1587">I leaned out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>, this was 1940 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and it was a sukkotrp, cool morning and I felt a terrible pain in my breast, in my lungs, my chest.</sentence><sentence id="1588">And within a few hours, the doctors were there and they told me I have pneumonia, double pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="1589">In those days there was no treatment for pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="1590">My husband came back immediately, my father-in-law who still knew a lot about " anyway, they got together.</sentence><sentence id="1591">Sulfur was a way of treatment, but the medical knowledge at that point was if you lived seven days, I was pretty much unconscious with an extremely high fever, if you lived seven days, if you lived through the seven days you survive, otherwise you die at the seventh day.</sentence><sentence id="1592">So they put cups, what they called cups, glass cups on my chest, which I hated, but worse, they brought leeches.</sentence><sentence id="1593">And the leeches were always used medicinally by a barber, I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="1594">The barber has a jar of leeches.</sentence><sentence id="1595">I can't remember, half conscious as I was, I kept sukkotking my head, I don't want leeches but he put leeches.</sentence><sentence id="1596">And whether the hot cups or the leeches or my father's prayers, whichever it was I woke up saying, I'm hungry, and this was the end of my</sentence><sentence id="1598">3 pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="1599">Almost the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was involved in my pneumonia.</sentence><sentence id="1600">The three doctors were day and night and at my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1601">Their names I do remember, Dr. Tye-sukkot (ph), Dr. Fry-gar (ph) and Dr. Fleish (ph), all three of them.</sentence><sentence id="1602">When I got well, and I recovered pretty quickly I was young, and my mother took good care of me, I recovered, they insisted that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> should see me.</sentence><sentence id="1603">They took a fee-ak-a (ph), and-drosh-kind (ph) and a pair of horses and here were the three doctors with me and we traveled across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> so everybody knew I was truly alive.</sentence><sentence id="1604">In those days, you didn't pick up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">phone</span> [to call anyone].</sentence><sentence id="1605">because I would like the names of these doctors to be remembered somehow or another, they were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="1606">Dr. Fleish's (ph) daughter went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me, <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, is still alive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1607">So coming back to the German times, this I remember, famous doctors were in that aux-own-der (ph) being dragged.</sentence><sentence id="1608">We didn't know where people were being dragged, there were all kinds of rumors.</sentence><sentence id="1609">Later we found they went, dragged outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> called Sukkotp-a-roth-sa (ph) and they were shot there.</sentence><sentence id="1610">They had machine guns there.</sentence><sentence id="1611">There were all kinds of rumors that they went somewhere but somewhere or other it began to bother us that perhaps really the rumors that they were killed were true.</sentence><sentence id="1612">We didn't quite want to believe it.</sentence><sentence id="1613">Every few weeks there was another action.</sentence><sentence id="1614">One a very sad one was a moc- row-seat (ph), a very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where they dragged out all the Jews and for some reason they focused on them and then there were, food was already beginning to be rationed, there was little food.</sentence><sentence id="1615">And in 1942, it was Passover, 1942, when the posters on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> announced that all Jews have to

Did you talk together about what happening or whether?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1822">A: Yes, we were very, very worried.</sentence><sentence id="1823">We could see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1824">We began to, well, we never saw that all be killed, this was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1825">Some of us would disappear, we thought, the way they did.</sentence><sentence id="1826">People talked about the fact that these Jews were taken to the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, to the west-eastern part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> to work on <span class="DLF">farms</span> and we latched on to these stories, we really wanted to believe that.</sentence><sentence id="1827">Under no circumstances did

people.</sentence><sentence id="1830">And sometimes there was shooting right in front of us so we knew that things were terribly bad.</sentence><sentence id="1831">And there was beginning to be massive starvation.</sentence><sentence id="1832">People were going hungry, but there was always somebody who disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1833">You heard somebody, a cousin, an uncle, somebody just, just, he was taken away.</sentence><sentence id="1834">The word, the expression was taken away and many survivors still talk this way because we really didn't know the word, we don't know where they were killed, most of the time we don't know exactly when because taken away is the right expression for it because all we knew is we saw them disappear, being taken away.</sentence><sentence id="1835">The Ukrainians were extremely involved with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1836">Actually, they were shooting as much, they were rounding us up as much.</sentence><sentence id="1837">But the round ups, called ax-see-on (ph), were the most characteristic part of that period.</sentence><sentence id="1838">You were afraid of ax-see-on (ph) and you were beginning to think about <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1839">It never occurred to us that we would disperse among the native population.</sentence><sentence

identity cards that came, the cam-carda (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1845">Where with my name was Sarah, the man, I can't remember the name for the man, there was another Jewish name, biblical name for man, which means we were identified this way.</sentence><sentence id="1846">You couldn't move without a cam-carda (ph), you couldn't be out, you couldn't be in the <span class="DLF">street</span> after 6:00, you couldn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span>, everyday there were new restrictions of various serious natures.</sentence><sentence id="1847">There was a you-den-rot (ph) established, they asked my father to serve but he didn't want to serve, the chairman of the you-den-rot (ph) was a Mr.</sentence><sentence id="1849">5 Horowitz.</sentence><sentence id="1850">A Jewish police was established, my husband's brother volunteered for it because you first thought you would save Jews, later he was involved in all kinds, I assume of horrible things, although he didn't witness them.</sentence><sentence id="1851">It was getting worse everyday.</sentence><sentence id="1852">We didn't know what a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="1853">By the way, when the Soviets withdrew and the Germans were just about to come in my father in strange ways looked forward to it.</sentence><sentence id="1854">He remembered the Austrians and he thought the Germans would be part of it.</sentence><sentence id="1855">With the Russians he couldn't communicate, they took away everything from him.</sentence><sentence id="1856">It was the

it.</sentence><sentence id="1860">And they did it for their children, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1861">But they were very much attached to the German language, to the Austrians, so they didn't think that the Germans could be so bad because they really didn't know terribly much what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1862">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they didn't have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span>, people immigrated.</sentence><sentence id="1863">We knew someone from <span

id="1865">They didn't tell us what was going on in <span class="REGION">western Poland</span> because then they already had some camps.</sentence><sentence id="1866">They didn't tell, the Russians

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1918">Q: When the Germans came in and started the ax-see-on (ph) and you saw things on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, even though you didn't think it would be exterminations because who if any could have thought of that, did you see certain groups or certain people or were men more vulnerable than women did you think, or were they going to be the target?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1920">A: It was mixed, first were men which reinforced our false beliefs that they were taken to work.</sentence><sentence id="1921">Men, to a large extent.</sentence><sentence id="1922">But there was special categories taken.</sentence><sentence id="1923">At one point I saw the doctors, then came some of the lawyers, fathers of students with whom I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, one of them lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> still, one is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span>, they both were there.</sentence><sentence id="1924">Their fathers were lawyers.</sentence><sentence id="1925">Then it came for some workers, special workers, we were told the SS needs these workers.</sentence><sentence id="1926">But you could see</sentence><sentence id="1928">6 sometimes shooting in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1929">Oh, the children came much later and this was a real awakening at that point.</sentence><sentence id="1930">But, there were food limitations, severe food limitations.</sentence><sentence id="1931">We were beginning to be quite hungry, not starved yet, but hungry.</sentence><sentence id="1932">I remember the first day of Passover, this is in my mind very much, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1933">There was an announcement that we all had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they established three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and they assigned to us the very poor part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1934">We were permitted to take on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>, I don't know why they permitted some of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> still, permitted to take whatever we could in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1935">I remember I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, we took some dishes, a few potatoes, that's all we had.</sentence><sentence id="1936">And we settled in that one-room <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it seemed to me, a very extremely poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1937">It was pretty dark, it was the first at night.</sentence><sentence id="1938">It must have been five o'clock in the afternoon, was still enough time to prepare something for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="1939">I recall peeling potatoes, the potatoes I saved.</sentence><sentence id="1940">And suddenly I felt smoke and I looked around and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was on fire.</sentence><sentence id="1941">And we began to run.</sentence><sentence id="1942">We saw people being shot, we saw <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on fire including our own.</sentence><sentence id="1943">We began to run, we didn't know where to run, people are running we are running with them.</sentence><sentence id="1944">They were running to the other part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1945">In the other part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> lived my sister Frania and her husband and their child.</sentence><sentence id="1946">My husband stayed behind, he wanted to just catch something, still save something.</sentence><sentence id="1947">As we came there he arrived a few hours later, I remember, and his eyebrows were all burned and he came with a half-burned chicken.</sentence><sentence id="1948">He caught a chicken in order to feel us.</sentence><sentence id="1949">It was terribly bad but we left, we were alive.</sentence><sentence id="1950">And each time these things happen, we touched ourselves and touched each other.</sentence><sentence id="1951">We are alive.</sentence><sentence id="1952">This was Passover.</sentence><sentence id="1953">I went to my sister's place, she had a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1954">We all crowded in there, whatever food they had we ate it together.</sentence><sentence id="1955">We later found that many people from that <span class="NPIP">part</span>, whom they caught, they took them away and that's all we knew, they took them away.</sentence><sentence id="1956">And most of the time they took them to sukkotp-a-rof-ska (ph) and sometimes in the distance you could hear this shooting.</sentence><sentence id="1957">Still, it would be somebody they perhaps shot, they obviously must have taken for work, by then they took all of the children and families, whole families.</sentence><sentence id="1958">This was the ax-see-on (ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passover</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1959">Later on, we found out, and dreaded holidays, we knew they were always were around holidays.</sentence><sentence id="1960">Was easy for them to drag all the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1961">Finally we got a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> assigned to us in that other part of the</sentence><sentence id="1963">7 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1964">One, your <span class="DLF">windows</span> of that went to the <span class="DLF">air</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, but the inside of it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1965">Very small and my husband and I got an extremely small, it was a little <span class="DLF">porch</span> and my parents got another one in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1966">Things were getting worse everyday.</sentence><sentence id="1967">I recall getting up in the morning and looking at the panorama of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="1968">People were laying, some dead of typhoid fever or starvation.</sentence><sentence id="1969">An older Jew with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and a horse, which we later named the Messiah horse, would take these bodies on, put these dead bodies on that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and drive them out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for burial.</sentence><sentence id="1970">We called the horse the Messiah horse because it was the horse of liberation.</sentence><sentence id="1971">By then we felt that dying, what you call of natural death, was a blessing.</sentence><sentence id="1972">Some of my uncles had this death.</sentence><sentence id="1973">I recall these bodies in the littered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they were littering the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1974">I recall sometimes getting up the morning and seeing distorted faces hanging on the street lanterns.</sentence><sentence id="1975">And these distorted faces sometimes I saw the face of a teacher, of a relative, of a stranger.</sentence><sentence id="1976">This was the work of the SS or the common soldiers who knew where and what.</sentence><sentence id="1977">At night they would raid the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they would come in for a sport kind of thing, and would just find a few Jews and hang them on the street lanterns.</sentence><sentence id="1978">This I couldn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1979">This jolted me.</sentence><sentence id="1980">I could understand they would take away people because they need people to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, on the <span class="DLF">farms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1981">Why did they hang these teachers of mine?</sentence><sentence id="1982">By then I was pretty much fully aware of the tragedy, of the whole tragedy of it.</sentence><sentence id="1983">Then came a tremendous ax-see-on (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1984">This was in September, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="1985">There were little ones in between.</sentence><sentence id="1986">There was an announcement that all men have to report to the auto- bites-on (ph), that they have to take along some food and then they will be sent to the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> for work.</sentence><sentence id="1987">By then we were sophisticated enough not to trust them.</sentence><sentence id="1988">Only men, not women.</sentence><sentence id="1989">We figured still, if they want men only it must be for work, but on the other hand, everybody to register.</sentence><sentence id="1990">There were thousands of Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1991">By the way, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became augmented because the Jews from the providence's like your friends Alice Shick-ee (ph), Kos-off (ph), Kou-tee (ph), Uram- sukkot (ph), all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> were bringing, the Jews were brought into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, were all herded into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so the overcrowding was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="1992">That all of them, all men had to register, we knew this much, every man in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1993">Well, I remember that dilemma that evening before.</sentence><sentence id="1994">Who should go?</sentence><sentence id="1995">The man in my family was my father, my husband, my two</sentence><sentence id="1997">8 brothers-in-law, Frania's husband and Cyla's husband.</sentence><sentence id="1998">Menek was too young to be, they unified in that Menek wouldn't go.</sentence><sentence id="1999">We decided our father shouldn't go because we were afraid that he wouldn't be taken to work.</sentence><sentence id="2000">I recall this very sad day, he came in and I couldn't recognize him.</sentence><sentence id="2001">He took off his beard, he sukkotved his beard to look younger and he looked horrible.</sentence><sentence id="2002">He was beyond recognition because my father, you see his photo, was a very handsome man and the beard was part of the handsomeness.</sentence><sentence id="2003">And he looked about 100 years older but he decided he wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="2004">My husband we thought would be safe because he was permitted while in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, he was permitted to work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in his <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2005">They didn't know it to operate it so he had a Red Cross on part of his work clothes band, on part of his white band, he was permitted to go during the day so the Germans could have access to the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>, but in the evening he had to come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2006">Each evening, he was checked, he was trying to smuggle a little food for us, but each evening he was checked.</sentence><sentence id="2007">One day he was beaten up terribly because he tried to bring a few grains of rye, he had put them into his collar of his coat and they found it and they beat him up mercilessly.</sentence><sentence id="2008">But basically he was our contact with the outside world to some extent because he worked there and we decided to, he would be safe.</sentence><sentence id="2009">There was no question, they're not going to take him because him they needed.</sentence><sentence id="2010">The man decided to go, I don't know what made for the decision, probably there was still some sort of hope that they would go for work or something, and that, how could they hide?We had a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2011">My husband really installed us there, before he went, he put my mother, my sister Cyla who then had typhoid fever, her son, Menek, my other sister on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, me and Blancka Rosenberg.</sentence><sentence id="2012">He put us into that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> downstairs and he covered the opening of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with a little rug, put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> on top of it and was sitting then that day.</sentence><sentence id="2013">I'll never forget that day, it was a horrible day.</sentence><sentence id="2014">The men were gone.</sentence><sentence id="2015">We hoped they would return, we worried about our father mainly because he was older and we worried about him more than the others.</sentence><sentence id="2016">We thought they would return or go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="2017">Sitting there waiting, there were a few other families there, and Blanca's child wasn't there anymore, I don't believe so, no.</sentence><sentence id="2018">She was alone.</sentence><sentence id="2019">And suddenly we hear some footsteps on top of that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, with dogs.</sentence><sentence id="2020">And boots, German boots.</sentence><sentence id="2021">And the dogs stopped and started smelling and we knew this was the end.</sentence><sentence id="2022">I still</sentence><sentence id="2024">9 don't know what happened that they walked away.</sentence><sentence id="2025">Something distracted them, perhaps they didn't trust the dogs enough.</sentence><sentence id="2026">I do recall that moment when everybody stopped breathing.</sentence><sentence id="2027">It must have been a second but it felt like <span class="NPIP">eternity</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2028">And how the mouths of these babies were covered with pillows and I was sure the babies would suffocate.</sentence><sentence id="2029">They didn't, it was a moment.</sentence><sentence id="2030">By then we knew that our days are counted, that they meant us too, not only the men.</sentence><sentence id="2031">We were sitting there for hours, I say it felt like eternity, and suddenly we felt smoke.</sentence><sentence id="2032">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was burning, they set the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to fire.</sentence><sentence id="2033">We decided we have to go up.</sentence><sentence id="2034">We walked out, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was not on fire for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="2035">The neighboring <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were made of wood, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was not as made.</sentence><sentence id="2036">So, there was smoke all over.</sentence><sentence id="2037">The Germans seemed to have been at the end of their

there.</sentence><sentence id="2043">I remember the moment my sister, Frania with her baby, with her child, she had typhoid fever.</sentence><sentence id="2044">Somehow or other, late evening, the men come back.</sentence><sentence id="2045">Who came back?</sentence><sentence id="2046">Unbelievably, my father came back and my husband came back.</sentence><sentence id="2047">The husbands of my sisters did not come back.</sentence><sentence id="2048">We didn't know what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="2049">We comforted each other.</sentence><sentence id="2050">They were sending the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>'s to work.</sentence><sentence id="2051">The young men will be given food, they will be laborers.</sentence><sentence id="2052">We didn't quite believe it, a

they knew, we didn't know, nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="2055">We found out later through an escapee that they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span>, the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2201">A: Christopher Browning.</sentence><sentence id="2202">He has a whole chapter on that deportation day but I want to mix it in right now because I like to remember what I remember because this was all later.</sentence><sentence id="2203">We had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="2204">For many of us after the war, we didn't know that they, where they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="2205">We found out this</sentence><sentence id="2207">0 much, much later.</sentence><sentence id="2208">But there they were taken, that is where they were taken, they were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2209">This was the first time that we knew, we didn't know exactly, but some witnesses came back.</sentence><sentence id="2210">Some people escaped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they were telling us.</sentence><sentence id="2211">These were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, but he didn't know because he escaped.</sentence><sentence id="2212">This came, this was later and I'm trying very careful to disassociate these two sources of information, what we knew then and what we knew later.</sentence><sentence id="2213">But this is what swallowed my two brothers-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="2214">Menek's father and Alex's father, both young men, one was only 29, the other I believe was 32.</sentence><sentence id="2215">I always thought, how did they shove these young men into <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>, but they did.</sentence><sentence id="2216">We never saw them again.</sentence><sentence id="2217">My sister Frania was then, was very high, typhoid fever, and she kept the baby next to her body and he was not infected, nobody understands how this happened.</sentence><sentence id="2218">We were all starved, we were hungry.</sentence><sentence id="2219">After that ax-see-on (ph) the Germans arranged for us to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2220">It's reviewed in the Reich.</sentence><sentence id="2221">There were still thousands of Jews left, they were still being brought in from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">provincial towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2222">There seemed always to be more Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2223">Later I found out that on that day 8,000 Jews were removed but there were more.</sentence><sentence id="2224">I think they wanted to appease us, they wanted to appease us by making sure we will not hide, that there is still some life going on.</sentence><sentence id="2225">And actually after every ax-see-on (ph) which, after this extreme tension, this extreme pain, this extreme depression, a depression hung over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for hours.</sentence><sentence id="2226">After that you somehow recovered.</sentence><sentence id="2227">You got up in the morning and looked out, it was quiet, you went back to whatever you were trying to do, a little cooking, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2228">By then it was potato peels.</sentence><sentence id="2229">You went back to pray.</sentence><sentence id="2230">You went back to whatever <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2231">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where Blancka worked, in a tre-po-tosh (ph) factory, they were making uniforms for the German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="2232">Going out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was permitted with a special permission.</sentence><sentence id="2233">Each evening we have to come back.</sentence><sentence id="2234">Jews were still permitted to go out to these <span class="BUILDING">work places</span>, they always had to come back.</sentence><sentence id="2235">After each raid, after each ax-see-on (ph) there were days that you couldn't talk to each other.</sentence><sentence id="2236">You checked out who was still alive but then there was some normalcy.</sentence><sentence id="2237">Normalcy of life.</sentence><sentence id="2238">Amazing, but it was there.</sentence><sentence id="2239">People tried to go back.</sentence><sentence id="2240">I think the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span>, which they introduced so late through the yood-en-rod (ph) was a way of appeasing us, of making sure we would not be afraid to leave our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, which would make their work easier, but these are hindsight.</sentence><sentence id="2241">We didn't know</sentence><sentence id="2243">1 what happened then.</sentence><sentence id="2244">All we knew, the yood-en-rod (ph) asked my father, it was so important to make sure that everybody would get the right kind of portions, that soup, so they asked my father to supervise that <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span>, to stand to dish out that.</sentence><sentence id="2245">He was too weak by then, he just didn't want the job.</sentence><sentence id="2246">His legs were swollen.</sentence><sentence id="2247">He asked them whether they would permit his youngest daughter to do it and they did and so it was my job.</sentence><sentence id="2248">This I'll never forget again.</sentence><sentence id="2249">Originally to, they gave us some horse meat.</sentence><sentence id="2250">They made hamburgers of horse meat, they put in some horse meat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2251">The women there were making this into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hamburgers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2252">It took me a long time to get use to eating it.</sentence><sentence id="2253">But soup, and I remember the long, long <span class="DLF">lines</span> of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2254">Sometimes I would recognize relatives, sometimes recognize the teachers, sometimes I recognize the father of another student.</sentence><sentence id="2255">They didn't look like human beings, the way they shuffled their feet, the way they asked and the pleading tone, ged-dak (ph), ged-dak (ph) means sick.</sentence><sentence id="2256">The soup was, had a little vegetables but it was watered, there was a little bit, a few beans, a few other vegetables and everybody wanted to ged-dak (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2257">It was my job to be fair about it and to make sure everybody would get their right amount of food.</sentence><sentence id="2258">This lasted perhaps two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2259">One day, it was close to this <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> in which was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish slaughter house</span> in which chicken were always killed.</sentence><sentence id="2260">There was a scream and I figured what are the Germans bring, chicken, they are killing the chicken?</sentence><sentence id="2261">A few hours later they found they slaughtered in this <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span>, they slaughtered our children.</sentence><sentence id="2262">This was the end of the supplication, this was the end of me, this was just the end of me.</sentence><sentence id="2263">I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2264">Couldn't talk.</sentence><sentence id="2265">I couldn't tell anybody what I heard.</sentence><sentence id="2266">The rumor came later and everybody heard it.</sentence><sentence id="2267">This was the end of my <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2354">Q: Maria, when you came back from that horrendous experience, I mean, both the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> and then listening to the children, the people being slaughtered.</sentence><sentence id="2355">You said you came back and you didn't, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and you didn't tell anyone.</sentence><sentence id="2356">How were you able to keep it <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and, or not show anything, or?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2360">A: remember, I threw myself on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2361">We had a very small <span class="NPIP">place</span>, one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2362">I threw myself on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I sobbed and sobbed for hours.</sentence><sentence id="2363">And then I went, and then my husband came in and I think we began to talk, and then the news was all over.</sentence><sentence id="2364">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> knew by then, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but immediately I just couldn't put into words, I couldn't talk, I didn't, I didn't realize the extent of it.</sentence><sentence id="2365">I remember it was chronological I'm not sure that I remember exactly when it happened, but sometime in 1942, all of these things were towards the end of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="2366">A woman came to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, to this small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that my husband and I stayed, and I recall she fell on her knees pleading with him to give her something.</sentence><sentence id="2367">I cannot remember whether he did or didn't, I didn't understand what this was all about.</sentence><sentence id="2368">I found out later that she pleaded with him to give her cyanide for the child.</sentence><sentence id="2369">She's alive, this woman is alive and I think the child is alive, somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2370">This I heard many years later.</sentence><sentence id="2371">I'm trying to remember, she was from a in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>, Mrs. Hermann, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2372">Apparently the news came that the children would be taken away.</sentence><sentence id="2373">I think the full tragedy fell upon me at that point.</sentence><sentence id="2374">When I heard children, that they're planning to remove the children, then I knew that this was the end and there really is no way of escaping, there's no more talk about going to the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> for work or anything.</sentence><sentence id="2375">That night, it was after that butchering, that night sort of brought the full awareness, the full confrontation with the truth as to what was happening.</sentence><sentence id="2376">By then, I think Blancka who worked in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> at was Lydia, the Polish woman who was the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, it was about that time that she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> saying that Lydia is ready to give her papers to run away.</sentence><sentence id="2377">I still didn't understand the business of running away, I couldn't understand any of it.</sentence><sentence id="2378">A day later she brought papers and she showed me, she had a ken-card-da (ph), she had something which showed that she was, the name</sentence><sentence id="2380">3 was Bruen-flower Per-nash-ik (ph) and we encouraged her to go away although I wasn't sure because at one point earlier one of my colleagues was trying to get through the <span class="DLF">ghetto wall</span> and she was shot on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="2381">So there was a great deal of conflict that we were encouraging about, we already knew by then that things were going very, very bad.</sentence><sentence id="2382">She had lost all her family by then, so we thought, perhaps she should go.</sentence><sentence id="2383">She asked me that I should join, I wasn't ready to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="2384">My husband started talking about it.</sentence><sentence id="2385">He was nearly everyday on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and somehow or other he began working toward my escape without my knowledge of it because I didn't want to hear about it.</sentence><sentence id="2386">This was towards the end of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="2387">By then, we began to talk about it, that you need some <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2388">The number of the people was narrowing down very much, there were just a few thousand people left.</sentence><sentence id="2389">At it's height, I think there were 30,000 Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2390">So we knew that things are narrowing very much, but there was some peace.</sentence><sentence id="2391">They didn't do anything for a while.</sentence><sentence id="2392">Somehow or other we started talking about perhaps we could get some <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2393">We had a friend and a woman who was a customer in our <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, not quite a customer, she was a Polish woman, a very fine lady who was poor.</sentence><sentence id="2394">So, when she established a relation, my father who would give her some of the dishes whatever for, a little money, during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> days she occasionally smuggled some food for us.</sentence><sentence id="2395">Her name was Wein-a- rof-ska (ph), and her <span class="NPIP">place</span> was across from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which originally my sister Cyla and her husband lived.</sentence><sentence id="2396">Somehow or other, he was in touch with her.</sentence><sentence id="2397">I found out these things much later.</sentence><sentence id="2398">But he was also in touch with another couple.</sentence><sentence id="2399">Well, I'm jumping a little bit ahead of time here, but actually came December of 1942 when we began to talk seriously about it.</sentence><sentence id="2400">That I should be the ice breaker in a way, I should be the first one in the family to get out, to join Blancka, and then my sister and her child will come.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2444">Q: How would you describe peoples relationships with each other as things are getting so terrible?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2446">And you describe this <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> almost like they're ghosts walking towards you?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2447">A: Families are different.</sentence><sentence id="2448">I've seen a lot of, it's painful to talk about it because I saw in families, how people were grabbing the portion of food.</sentence><sentence id="2449">These were families like my own where we always kept passing the food, I'm not hungry.</sentence><sentence id="2450">Particularly my parents, we were this kind of family, close</sentence><sentence id="2452">4 family, always passing the food to the next one, we're not hungry.</sentence><sentence id="2453">But in some families, they were fighting for the bite of food.</sentence><sentence id="2454">The people looked liked ghost, they were, all of us were in this, in this <span class="REGION">area</span> there was no food left.</sentence><sentence id="2455">I remember when we started cooking the potato chips, potato peels.</sentence><sentence id="2456">My mother cooked it in water, she added a little salt to it.</sentence><sentence id="2457">This was the lunch.</sentence><sentence id="2458">Lydia Wen-a-rof- ska (ph), this is the Polish woman who sometimes smuggled in, in some way she smuggled in a little flour, so the flour had to be stretched.</sentence><sentence id="2459">It was mixed with, sometimes you had only potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="2460">But the starvation was everywhere, definitely.</sentence><sentence id="2461">I recall, somewhere or other I was younger and I think this helped because my parents legs were very swollen, particularly my father, he couldn't get into his shoes, he wore slippers my then.</sentence><sentence id="2462">I took a look at them at one <span class="NPIP">point</span> and I knew they could'nt't stretch it because of the starvation.</sentence><sentence id="2463">But more than that, I was just worried that they will be shot.</sentence><sentence id="2464">Sometimes I saw these weak people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, they didn't even bother to take them out, they shot them right there.</sentence><sentence id="2465">So it was at that time, but you want me to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lydia</span>, right?</sentence><sentence id="2466">To Lydia, I guess?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2489">Q: I want to ask you, was your father still praying, was he still religious in a certain way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2491">A: Yes, he was still praying.</sentence><sentence id="2492">Many of the orthodox Jews were still praying.</sentence><sentence id="2493">I hope he prayed when he was going to death, I hope so, because praying you know, somehow or other gets into another <span class="NPIP">orbit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2494">I read about it later, that many of the Has-sid-ims (ph) they went into the fire while praying so they didn't feel what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2495">I suppose that some of these behaviors anesthetized them, I am not sure it happened to my father but, I wish it would.</sentence><sentence id="2496">They were, I'll tell you in a minute how they were killed, and that horrible death, but anyway, working in that part, in the ta-kosh (ph) factory we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every day but then there were days that we were not permitted to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="2497">And when Blancka left, she somehow or other, she put something into the mind of my husband in particular, that there is a way out.</sentence><sentence id="2498">But whether he'd thought about it earlier I'm not sure, he didn't sukkotre it with me.</sentence><sentence id="2499">By the way, he looked extremely non-Jewish while I looked Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2500">I didn't know I looked Jewish until I got to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, but he did and his Polish was perfect too, so he had some ideas at that point, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2501">He started talking about me and I didn't want to hear about it.</sentence><sentence id="2502">Finally, the arrangement was that I would be the first one to go to meet Blancka, then my</sentence><sentence id="2504">5 sister and her baby would come, and then he would arrange for my oldest sister and her son and my parents, he will arrange a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, through the help of this Lydia Wen-a-rof-ska (ph), and then he will come.</sentence><sentence id="2505">And he got himself papers too.</sentence><sentence id="2506">I can't remember the name, but he said he had papers.</sentence><sentence id="2507">He had, he brought in papers one day, sometime in December, he brought in papers with the name of Julianna Gol-ska (ph), he showed me, that's me.</sentence><sentence id="2508">He told me he obtained it through the help of some non-Jewish family and this was authentic.</sentence><sentence id="2509">Actually a girl who looked like me, who had died, and he purchased the papers, who he got them through I still don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2510">There was so little talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="2511">Perhaps he talked more and the fright on my part really obstructed my thinking about it, or my memory about it.</sentence><sentence id="2512">I recall, the only way, I still don't know how I decided to go.</sentence><sentence id="2513">The only way, because he worked so skillfully on me, that he'll join me in two weeks, he'll come and meanwhile he had arranged all these things, and it seemed, he told me the idea thing, that I will be the path breaker, that P'll be the one to lead the way and they will all survive this way.</sentence><sentence id="2514">Whether I really believed it, I wanted to believe it, I still don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2515">It was a very hard decision but there was no time for decision.</sentence><sentence id="2516">Somehow or other they told me tomorrow, these people will pick you up in the morning at 6:00 in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="2517">It was Christmas, 1942, the people I personally didn't know but my family did.</sentence><sentence id="2518">They were landowners, Polish landowners, sort of an aristocracy, who had business with my father.</sentence><sentence id="2519">My father use to give them these fine porcelain things and they remembered him and they wanted to do something for the family.</sentence><sentence id="2520">How we got hold of them, I still don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2521">Perhaps my father talked to him, some of these things I wish I knew but I do not.</sentence><sentence id="2522">It was Christmas morning, he brought in the night before a krosh-ock (ph), a krosh-ock (ph) is a Ukrainian fur coat, which is a peasant coat, which is skin on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and lambs wool inside.</sentence><sentence id="2523">Very, you have it on the photos you see of Kolomyja, peasant girls always wore these things, it was warm.</sentence><sentence id="2524">I remember he buttoned me up.</sentence><sentence id="2525">I remember he put into this sleeve, he put into five dollars into the sleeve of this krosh-ock (ph) we called it, the coat.</sentence><sentence id="2526">I said good-bye to my family the night before, at 6:00 in the morning, Christmas morning, 1942, these people were waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a pair of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleighs</span> with horses.</sentence><sentence id="2527">I wish I could remember details, all I know is I went through the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, which was not very far, the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2528">I saw a policeman walking back and forth, he didn't see</sentence><sentence id="2530">6 me.</sentence><sentence id="2531">I recall removing the white arm band and all I know, I was in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and they passed on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of my <span class="INT_SPACE">parents room</span> was through the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and I saw silhouettes of my parents in the <span class="DLF">window</span> behind curtains.</sentence><sentence id="2532">And I had the strange sense that I'l] never see them again.</sentence><sentence id="2533">Despite the promises my husband made.</sentence><sentence id="2534">And I remember how I tried totally to deny that feeling, to stop that feeling, to stop thinking about it and to concentrate on the ride, and I was sure that somebody will identify me, after all, people knew me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I supposed so.</sentence><sentence id="2535">But I was with these Polish people twice my age, they brought me to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2536">The man went out, he bought me a ticket to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph), I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I remember very little about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride except that I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph) in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of their niece or cousin, it was a Christmas party.</sentence><sentence id="2537">Exactly what I needed at that point, but I came there, I was introduced as their friend from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and it was a lot of festivity going on, there was food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2538">I tried to join and then in the evening I left.</sentence><sentence id="2539">I was suppose to come back to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2540">And suddenly I saw a middle-aged man following me.</sentence><sentence id="2541">I remember he was dressed in a very warm way, there was a sort of kerchief on his head, and he said, Madame, he said in Polish to me, Mrs. Nei-dat (ph), you are the wife of the night of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> you look very cute, something of this sort, and I started running, and he ran after me.</sentence><sentence id="2542">It was a cold night of Christmas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph) and I think my young, and I could hear his breath against me, and this must have been a scene of running, nobody else was in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, there was quite a bit of sleet, it was cold, Christmas night.</sentence><sentence id="2543">But I was young and I was a good runner and somehow or other, I still don't believe how this happened, he couldn't follow my steps.</sentence><sentence id="2544">And he stopped somewhere, I ran into a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, then another <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and I saw him again, and I could hear his breath and then everything stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2545">I never went back to these people.</sentence><sentence id="2546">But I had an address of, Blancka gave me some address on High-lit-ska (ph) Street and I went there and I made up a whole story and she wasn't there, I hoped to meet her, and without her and being all alone, it was the first experience, all I wanted the next day was to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2547">And I got in touch with that friend who helped her, Ad-ja (ph) was his name, a German Jew originally who had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and he was very well entrenched as a Pole, he looked like Polish nobility, and I let him know I was here, he came to see me.</sentence><sentence id="2548">We locked the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and I told</sentence><sentence id="2550">7 him, I don't want to hear about anything, all he can do for me was to go to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and buy me a ticket, I was afraid to run around the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and all I want is to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2551">The man saved my life in strange ways by talking to six hours, he literally out-talked me.</sentence><sentence id="2552">By then, I was totally, totally passive and totally listless.</sentence><sentence id="2553">I pleaded, all I want is to die with my people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and no argument really made sense to me, I wanted to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and I wanted to die with my people, and he kept saying that I'll never get to my people, you will not be able to get into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they will shoot me at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, and nothing penetrated.</sentence><sentence id="2554">Perhaps it did and I didn't want to hear it.</sentence><sentence id="2555">I remember that after six hours, I couldn't hear anymore.</sentence><sentence id="2556">And he didn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and I passed another day and he made up a whole story, he was my fiancee, he was somebody that was interested in me, and he will visit again.</sentence><sentence id="2557">And then later was very interested in him, he looked like Polish nobility, I was figuring there was some money too, I stayed another day and another day.</sentence><sentence id="2558">And I had a story, the story was that I came to study , | take a course.</sentence><sentence id="2559">So, the classes are not held every day and it's pretty flexible.</sentence><sentence id="2560">Anyway, with the Czech she looked away, she didn't know, I still don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2561">We don't know these things, but she kept me.</sentence><sentence id="2562">A few days later Blancka arrives.</sentence><sentence id="2563">Things fell through for her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, she had only been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, they caught into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, and there things broke.</sentence><sentence id="2564">So she came back here and we started a life together in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, in that <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span>, and he would visit us and was, she always was a charismatic student and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2565">And one day, and this is after Christmas naturally, I had news from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, from Maria Roman-o-rof-ski (ph), through that woman who pushed food into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and that everything was still the same, no change, they were still alive.</sentence><sentence id="2566">And one day, Blanca's looking for work, everybody said I shouldn't walk in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> so easily, but then people were conscious I looked Jewish, I didn't know, but Blancka looked Polish, so she went for a newspaper very early in the morning to see what the , what or where were jobs, to look for a job.</sentence><sentence id="2567">And she hears somebody, calls her Blancka, and she got very frightened naturally because by then her name was Broom-ka Ba-nat-chek (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2568">She took a look in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span>, sits my sister with the baby and her sister-in-law and they look like chimney sweeps, all covered with ashes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, from running away from the fires in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2569">She brought</sentence><sentence id="2571">8 them upstairs to her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the story came out.</sentence><sentence id="2572">The story came out that on the 2nd of February, which I always remember for other reasons too, this was the time that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> was taken over by the Soviets, this was the first German defeat and was a change in the war, I didn't know then what, all I knew is that on the 2nd of February, the night of the 2nd of February, my parents and my older sister and Menek were sitting in another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by then, in their <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, all dressed.</sentence><sentence id="2573">For days they expected, they expected the SS or the Germans to come and take them.</sentence><sentence id="2574">There was no way out by then, it was a very cold night.</sentence><sentence id="2575">And Menek told me years later that somebody came in from the neighbor's to tell about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and that my father's spirit was lifted, and I'm so grateful for that moment, that his spirit was lifted.</sentence><sentence id="2576">But it was 2 o'clock in the morning or so, they came, and they took all out of them, they took them out.</sentence><sentence id="2577">I found out later that they women were separated, my mother and my sister, her daughter and her distant cousin, a young girl, , Tou- chie (ph) was her name, they were separated and the men, my father and his grandson, Menek, were taken separate.</sentence><sentence id="2578">And hungry they were, they were ill, they were not dressed well, it was terribly cold, sleet in the night, in the middle of the night, they dragged them through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>, they dragged them to Chap-a-rot-ska (ph) to be killed there.</sentence><sentence id="2579">Frania, who lived in another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, but then her husband had been taken away, she was with the child and she was with her sister and her husband's sister-in-law, this woman left her baby in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, she ran without the baby.</sentence><sentence id="2580">She and my sister and Alex Schlessing, Alex's name was Elee-ow (ph) then, they ran through the fire.</sentence><sentence id="2581">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was set on fire, they ran through the fire and half burned all, all covered with ashes, they found themselves at a neighboring <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, they bought tickets and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Re-volf</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2582">And they didn't know where to go, they didn't have an address or anything, so they saw one light, lit up, so they went into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to find out about a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was the criminal polizer, the police, the German police, nothing but.</sentence><sentence id="2583">Somebody prayed for them.</sentence><sentence id="2584">They said, there are no <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span>, they walked out.</sentence><sentence id="2585">And they sat in a <span class="DLF">doorway</span> and that is where Blancka met them and she found them.</sentence><sentence id="2586">My sister told us of the terrible details, that the parents were separated, and what happened to her and that they could hear the shots.</sentence><sentence id="2587">And she thinks, she thought perhaps Menek escaped, she wasn't sure.</sentence><sentence id="2588">Nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="2589">All I remember, this was late afternoon,</sentence><sentence id="2591">9 listening to the story, all I recall was that all I hoped for was that the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> would open up and I will disappear.</sentence><sentence id="2592">I didn't want to live.</sentence><sentence id="2593">She didn't know enough about my husband, he was separated from my father and Menek.</sentence><sentence id="2594">She thought she heard something, that he was taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, that they were beating him, she wasn't sure, nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="2595">I still don't know.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Apparently, they either killed him in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> or took him to Chap-a-rof-sa (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2597">That was the night, the last night after that, no Jew was left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2598">My nephew, Menek, wrote up about that night.</sentence><sentence id="2599">I recall that I couldn't stand just being alive.</sentence><sentence id="2600">I stretched on that <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, Frania too, and I wanted nothing but for the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to open and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> didn't open, that hard floor was there.</sentence><sentence id="2601">I couldn't even cry.</sentence><sentence id="2602">I couldn't take it in in any way.</sentence><sentence id="2603">Except Blancka woke me from that stupor I think sometime later saying that the landlady wants to bring us some tea.</sentence><sentence id="2604">And this meant we had to get up, wash up, and look pretty.</sentence><sentence id="2605">And I recall looking at the mirror and putting on lipstick and not believing it's me.</sentence><sentence id="2606">She brought in tea.</sentence><sentence id="2607">We had to make arrangements for my sister's place, they slept over that night, we made up a cock-eyed story and later we tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them.</sentence><sentence id="2608">They found other people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, other women, the men were all killed by then.</sentence><sentence id="2609">And the story of many came out much later.</sentence><sentence id="2610">What happened to him is a really fantastic story.</sentence><sentence id="2611">He was together with my father, being marched from that horrible night, and there was shooting and the dogs were barking and the dogs were biting some people.</sentence><sentence id="2612">And he was blaming my father in a way, saying, I told you we should have run away earlier, we should have gone to the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, whatever, and my father said to him, something from the Talmud, he said, the Talmud says if the sword is around your neck, a miracle may happen.</sentence><sentence id="2613">He was then 15 or 16 years old, he interpreted this as a sign from his grandfather he should run away, so he ran away.</sentence><sentence id="2614">For years he was trying to get hold of that quotation, found out about it rather recently, but he ran away and the people were being marched, they were marched to Sukkotp-a-rot-ska (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2615">By then it was early morning and the neighbors could look out and some saw the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2616">And he was wounded in his leg, a shot came to, a bullet got into his leg.</sentence><sentence id="2617">He fell on snow and ice.</sentence><sentence id="2618">A Ukrainian policeman stepped over him and said to the Germans very stoically, he's dead.</sentence><sentence id="2619">And as that colonnade of people marched and marched for hours, he was lying there, then he felt himself alive, just bleeding, so he crouched, he approached a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> he knew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where he had worked somewhere and</sentence><sentence id="2621">0 he saw a baby in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2622">This is a story he told me about five years ago, he couldn't talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="2623">And he didn't know whether the parents who ran, left the baby, hid the baby there because apparently there was no fire before, or whether the Ukrainians or Germans put the baby into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> and set the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> afire.</sentence><sentence id="2624">This he kept secret.</sentence><sentence id="2625">Somehow or other, he jumped from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> because he heard the SS marching, and the Ukrainians, he jumped in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2626">He was jumping most of the time, he heard the shots and through in that snow he got outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the Polish woman, Bron-ra-off-ska (ph), who use to live across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and who use to take care of the plants of the flower plants of my sister-in-law when my sister went on vacation.</sentence><sentence id="2627">This Polish woman was poor and she supported herself by renting <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian gymnasium</span> students.</sentence><sentence id="2628">So she had a husband and she had two students who lived there because they went to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and they paid her something, that's how she lived.</sentence><sentence id="2629">Very early morning, he appeared at the <span class="DLF">door</span> of this woman.</sentence><sentence id="2630">I'm sure he looked more animal than human, and he heard the shots going on the Chap-a-rot-ska (ph), he knew this was his mother, he knew this was his grandparents, and he pleaded with the woman to let him in for the night, he was bleeding.</sentence><sentence id="2631">And she said she can't, she's afraid because the Ukrainian students were there.</sentence><sentence id="2632">Somehow or other, I think, out of pity for this child-animal, she let him in for one night.</sentence><sentence id="2633">She put him in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2634">Next morning she came to take him out and she was one who my father helped occasionally with some of the dishes to give her for a little money, I don't know what moved her, she didn't have the heart to take him out.</sentence><sentence id="2635">She left him, she covered him with straw and under straw he lived there for about six or seven months.</sentence><sentence id="2636">She kept him there.</sentence><sentence id="2637">She lived with great danger, her husband she apparently let on many months later.</sentence><sentence id="2638">The Ukrainian students never knew about it.</sentence><sentence id="2639">Every night she would smuggle a little food downstairs.</sentence><sentence id="2640">He was immobilized, he didn't move, it was then.</sentence><sentence id="2641">One day, he remembers, it was Spring by then.</sentence><sentence id="2642">Well, that night, he says, all he kept thinking, which of these bullets killed his mother and his grandfather and his grandmother because that's all he could hear, all night and all day the shooting was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2643">This was the last of the Kolomyja Jews and he remembers that all he was, felt guilty that he wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="2644">But he was covered in snow, by straw.</sentence><sentence id="2645">And one day, toward the Spring in March, he saw the snow coming</sentence><sentence id="2647">1 down the <span class="DLF">windows</span> so it was a little light.</sentence><sentence id="2648">Until then, he didn't see any daylight because snow and ice covered the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2649">And he looked around and he saw some books.</sentence><sentence id="2650">These Ukrainian students apparently when graduating they threw the books into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2651">One of the books he took was a chemistry book.</sentence><sentence id="2652">He started reading.</sentence><sentence id="2653">That is why he's one of the foremost bio-chemist.</sentence><sentence id="2654">He's the one who is the developer of the ; ; Menek Goldstein.</sentence><sentence id="2655">This was the beginning of it, the chemistry book.</sentence><sentence id="2656">He lived hungry there because very little food she could afford to give him, she was afraid, every night would bring down a little bit, he was a growing boy.</sentence><sentence id="2657">And he lived in extreme terror of discovery, always afraid of the Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="2658">And one day, the woman comes in, she says, there is a denouncement, somebody denounced that she's harboring a Jew, he has to disappear.</sentence><sentence id="2659">That night, it was Spring of 1944, that he had to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2660">And he remembered that Selik (ph), my husband's brother, had told him some time ago that he and some others would have a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2661">In the middle of the night he ran to that <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, they didn't want to let him in.</sentence><sentence id="2662">They didn't want another person, they were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2663">But my brother-in-law insisted, he had a gun with him because he was a policeman, so they let him in.</sentence><sentence id="2664">So he was liberated there by the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="2665">When the Soviets came he couldn't walk so they carried him.</sentence><sentence id="2666">The Soviet soldiers carried him on their arms to the , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">municipality</span> to show what happened.</sentence><sentence id="2667">Later on, is a long story.</sentence><sentence id="2668">But, there's the story of Menek.</sentence><sentence id="2669">Later on still begins a long story, but that's one of, this is how Menek survived and how he depicted it in his statement about the last night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2670">And us he told little details each time, each time we commemorate in a quiet way.</sentence><sentence id="2671">My sister, Menek and I, we commemorate February 2nd.</sentence><sentence id="2672">We don't have any celebration, we don't do anything much, but we don't go to <span class="BUILDING">cinemas</span> and we don't do any entertainment, we have dinner together and we sit down and over the years always some detail comes out.</sentence><sentence id="2673">Some of these details just came out within a few years.</sentence><sentence id="2674">He couldn't talk about that baby, he couldn't talk about some of the things.</sentence><sentence id="2675">But that book of chemistry had such an influence.</sentence><sentence id="2676">It's a long story about Menek, another time perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="2677">So I worked because I wanted to make sure that the story of the last day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, my parents horrible deaths, how they dragged them in that terrible, on ice, how they were falling around and I hoped they never reached that 9</sentence><sentence id="2679">2 that they died on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, but I'll never know.</sentence><sentence id="2680">They were separated, men and women.</sentence><sentence id="2681">Can you imagine what happened to my father all alone.</sentence><sentence id="2682">Menek ran away, he didn't know Menek would survive to tell this story but he did.</sentence><sentence id="2683">So, this was the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2684">I knew these details from my sister in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, that evening, and I said, we have to get up because this lady decided to give us tea, we have to make up and look human.</sentence><sentence id="2685">Then we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for her and then started all kinds of troubles because somebody told her that she is harboring Jews and had to run away from the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2686">Anyway, it was, one day I walked with my sister and her child, and she was in grave danger because the boy was circumcised and with two of her friends, women friends from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and their children.</sentence><sentence id="2687">And we were looking for the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to live because they were denounced by then.</sentence><sentence id="2688">My sister had some diamonds sewn into the buttons of her sweater, she never removed the sweater.</sentence><sentence id="2689">Each time things happened, she sold the diamonds somehow or other.</sentence><sentence id="2690">Kept all of us, Blancka and me alive too.</sentence><sentence id="2691">At one point, I needed new documents and the diamonds bought it.</sentence><sentence id="2692">We need an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and the diamonds bought it.</sentence><sentence id="2693">We were looking for something and I notice a girl who looks at me very much, it was a former student from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, a Ukrainian girl.</sentence><sentence id="2694">And before I know, I notice that she is bringing over a Ukrainian policeman.</sentence><sentence id="2695">It was very dangerous and I motioned to Branch and to the other women, it's not good, we have to do something, we have to disappear, but how do we disappear?</sentence><sentence id="2696">He's looking at us.</sentence><sentence id="2697">So we decided to disappear in the next <span class="BUILDING">store</span>, which was a <span class="BUILDING">millenary store</span>, selling hats.</sentence><sentence id="2698">This is 6 o'clock in the evening and we try on every hat in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> hoping that this man will disappear.</sentence><sentence id="2699">Well, sitting there and trying on hats is exactly what we need at that point, he did not disappear.</sentence><sentence id="2700">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> closed, we had to move.</sentence><sentence id="2701">He did approach us, in very quiet words, voice, not to make any noise, he said, come with me, I know your Jewisses.</sentence><sentence id="2702">He started marching us out, what helped us most was it was dark.</sentence><sentence id="2703">The darkness helped all of us at that point.</sentence><sentence id="2704">And he took us somewhere in an isolated <span class="REGION">area</span>, he had a revolver with him and he said, I'm going to shoot you.</sentence><sentence id="2705">So we started pleading.</sentence><sentence id="2706">I started pleading with him that he shouldn't shoot my sister, if he has to shoot someone, me, because she had a baby, she had a child.</sentence><sentence id="2707">Anyway, he decided not to shoot but to take everything we had.</sentence><sentence id="2708">Rings, jewelry, whatever we had, there were five women of us.</sentence><sentence id="2709">He got everything.</sentence><sentence id="2710">He even took my coat.</sentence><sentence id="2711">We couldn't go back to</sentence><sentence id="2713">3 that <span class="NPIP">place</span> were we lived anymore, we had to find new <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2714">This was continuous when they caught us, we had to.</sentence><sentence id="2715">Finally we got a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, things quieted down a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="2716">It was a better time.</sentence><sentence id="2717">Blancka and I got jobs in a <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2718">This was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the treatment of returned soldiers from the front.</sentence><sentence id="2719">They had frost bite, they were sick, they had wounds, so Blancka became their scrub woman and I was assigned to the apothotacary (ph) which was very good for me because I knew something and I was handy about things, but I never disclosed that I knew German or anything so I was dumb.</sentence><sentence id="2720">It was quite a period in our lives except we sukkotred a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere, a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span>, and I developed a terrible pain in my feet.</sentence><sentence id="2721">I couldn't walk, I couldn't walk to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2722">And the question was, what do I do, how does one go to a doctor?</sentence><sentence id="2723">Finally things are so bad that they decided I have to go to a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="2724">It was Polish doctor and he said, I have flat feet.</sentence><sentence id="2725">Which I got because I was so swollen, I ate only potatoes, breads, whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="2726">And I swell up to such an extent, I weigh so much more .</sentence><sentence id="2727">Anyway, he put me into some shoes which I wore through the rest of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2728">It helped immensely.</sentence><sentence id="2729">And things were pretty smooth at one <span class="NPIP">point</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2730"><span class="COUNTRY">Frania</span> was also set up somewhere and one day, in that <span class="BUILDING">apothecary</span>, the Ukrainian girl walks in.</sentence><sentence id="2731">She must have followed me or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2732">And she knew Stodge (ph), the chief of the Upper Taker (ph) German men in uniforms in the <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2733">And she says, I know from that she's Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2734">And he paled, I could see the blood was running down his face and immediately he reaches out for the telephone, I assume to call the military police, and I jumped through the <span class="DLF">window</span>, it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2735">I don't know, I don't know how I did it, I did it!</sentence><sentence id="2736">How did I walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I jumped through, how did I did it, I don't know?</sentence><sentence id="2737">And I run into Blanca's other, to her and I say, let's escape, and we run away, told our story, couldn't get back anymore because we knew that we would be denounced.</sentence><sentence id="2738">We found out hours later, we find posters with our names and also in it they said Jewish Women and they masquerade for, they're trying to fool the German government, and so much money is offered for our capture and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2739">We sat in <span class="DLF">doorways</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ed-au</span> (ph), somehow it involved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ed-au</span> (ph), he was with us, he helped.</sentence><sentence id="2740">He got us tickets at night we went to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>, we got tickets to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2741">I never knew anything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, I knew nobody.</sentence><sentence id="2742">Blancka had been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, she knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2743">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> people were talking about soap being</sentence><sentence id="2745">4 made of Jews, we don't understand what they're talking about, we had no idea about these things.</sentence><sentence id="2746">I had a strange, weird feeling but I never understood what they talk was about.</sentence><sentence id="2747">Jewish muscles are being turned into soap.</sentence><sentence id="2748">Some primitive, very under-educated women sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with us.</sentence><sentence id="2749">We, our arrival, who I thought was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night train</span>, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night train</span> was the best things because it was dark, we arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you had to apply for a job there.</sentence><sentence id="3455">There had to be proof for a job there.</sentence><sentence id="3456">For me just to show myself, show my face in these <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="3457">So we maintained our contact mainly through correspondence at that point, but until then, we were extremely inter-dependent.</sentence><sentence id="3458">Her looks were helpful, I had more sense of danger I think, of reality, I was quick this way for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="3459">I think we complemented each other very well this way, but we were very close to each other and as I say, we were intimate in our relationship and I knew of the losses she suffered.</sentence><sentence id="3460">She knew very much of my family life.</sentence><sentence id="3461">She tried to steal some oranges in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to bring to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lash-ick</span> (ph) so we were very intertwined, extremely so.</sentence><sentence id="3462">And her absence left a tremendous void in my life, but more than that, a sense of danger too, that I'm all alone here.</sentence><sentence id="3463">I had no idea the war was coming to an end.</sentence><sentence id="3464">Coming back to it, I remember Bowl-ick (ph) and Helene Ko-vet-all-lich-al (ph) and Lod-ja (ph), we had intermittent contact.</sentence><sentence id="3465">From the time she had left until I joined her wasn't that long.</sentence><sentence id="3466">I'm trying to remember, I can't remember exactly when she left but somehow within the next few months the Germans started running.</sentence><sentence id="3467">We heard about it, that the Soviets are approaching.</sentence><sentence id="3468">Even before that, Blancka and I</sentence><sentence id="3470">2 celebrated each victory on the part of the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="3471">At one point, we heard that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> was liberated and this came through the radio, the British radio, no, another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="3472">On the British radio, on that radio we heard it later in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3473">So we celebrated each time, quietly.</sentence><sentence id="3474">We had such a double life, an official life and a life between each other.</sentence><sentence id="3475">We were extremely close, I would say, in a very intimate kind of relationship.</sentence><sentence id="3476">We maintained it later for many decades too.</sentence><sentence id="3477">But when she left, it was pretty, I did have some correspondence, I heard a little of it, that she was working in a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="3478">She didn't seem to be in danger of any kind, danger of detection.</sentence><sentence id="3479">It was very soon afterwards we heard rumors that the Soviets are approaching, they are taking over large parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the <span class="REGION">eastern part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3480">And one day, I remember, the German family for whom I worked just took off to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they didn't come back.</sentence><sentence id="3481">And within a few days, the office workers also left.</sentence><sentence id="3482">And then I was all alone when I heard that the Soviets are approaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, they're in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3483">Being all alone, the telephone stopped working, I would have like to call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, I would like to call Helena but I couldn't, but I was all alone, I figured, well, in a few hours or so the Soviets are going to be here, so walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3484">This was a German section, the Germans were not there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3485">There were Poles, and I knew the Soviets are coming in.</sentence><sentence id="3486">I didn't really think about my sister, Frania, she was involved with the child, I didn't know about Menek, although we did have some intermittent communication.</sentence><sentence id="3487">At one <span class="NPIP">point</span>, pretty much everything stopped, we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="3488">But I knew that I'm going to be free in a few hours.</sentence><sentence id="3489">But the Soviets did not come in.</sentence><sentence id="3490">And I was all alone in that big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, not understanding why they take so much time.</sentence><sentence id="3491">The following morning, I began to hear some shooting.</sentence><sentence id="3492">I later found out there was an uprising, the Poles started an uprising against the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="3493">This was beyond my belief!</sentence><sentence id="3494">Well, before I knew, the Germans were coming back and the Poles seemed to be fighting both the Germans and the Soviets.</sentence><sentence id="3495">I walked out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> to see what's happening, I was terribly isolated by then.</sentence><sentence id="3496">I saw people running.</sentence><sentence id="3497">All the Polish people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> were running.</sentence><sentence id="3498">I joined them, I didn't know why people were running.</sentence><sentence id="3499">And so we kept running, we moved slowly into <span class="DLF">sewers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3500">Suddenly I'm in <span class="DLF">sewers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3501">And then the Polish people began to talk about what happened.</sentence><sentence id="3502">That there was an uprising, that the Soviets didn't come in, that the Germans are</sentence><sentence id="3504">3 back.</sentence><sentence id="3505">And that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is being burned down.</sentence><sentence id="3506">Well, I didn't feel a minute anymore about being, the part about being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3507">This did not, somehow or other, I can't remember, that Helin-ka (ph) and Bowl-ick (ph) joined me.</sentence><sentence id="3508">I think we ran together but this is what I'd like know, to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Helin-ka</span> (ph) to find out these details.</sentence><sentence id="3509">I don't remember whether we, how many days we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sewers</span>, but it seemed like an eternity naturally.</sentence><sentence id="3510">And from time to time, the <span class="DLF">sewer door</span> would open and you could see a <span class="DLF">street</span> and you could hear some shooting and then it would close again and we were again in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3511">I don't remember how we were fed but somebody, there was some crumbs of food going around.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3582">Q: Were you in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3584">A: In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, that high up.</sentence><sentence id="3585">And these were not the sewers of the ghetto, these were the sewers of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="3586">Some were in uniforms, some were civilians, all age groups.</sentence><sentence id="3587">I didn't know how far we were going, what it was I thought a day, but it was more than a day definitely.</sentence><sentence id="3588">It was a good many days, the idea was, I found out later, that we will be going up to the vestibular where we will get out and get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go to the Soviets, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3589">Finally we arrived at the vestibular and Bowl-ick (ph) and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hel-inka</span> (ph) and I, by the way, we wrapped around ourselves a blanket so we wouldn't be separated because there were lots of people there, we were afraid we would be torn apart.</sentence><sentence id="3590">And to come out in that bright sunshine, this was September of 1944, August, end of August, beginning of September, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="3591">And we tried to get into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, there were many people coming out of the <span class="DLF">sewers</span>, and we see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is pretty much in flames, and we try to get ona <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3592">We cannot get in, it's filled, Bowl-ick (ph) got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hel-inka</span> (ph) and I still waited for another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come.</sentence><sentence id="3593">The Soviets are right across the vestibular, some people were trying to swim it.</sentence><sentence id="3594">Suddenly from no where the Germans appeared, the vestibular is at the bottom of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3595">The important part of the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3596">Suddenly, there are Germans in the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and from no where I feel a bullet in my back.</sentence><sentence id="3597">They shot me through my coat, I was in a coat, and I'm bleeding.</sentence><sentence id="3598">And the same bullet goes into the arm of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hel-inka</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3599">I fell to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, she didn't I think.</sentence><sentence id="3600">I was pretty unconscious, I was bleeding.</sentence><sentence id="3601">And then they have us get up, I still don't understand how it was possible for me to be bleeding and get up, and we are being marched.</sentence><sentence id="3602">We</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3605">4 were apparently, I found out later, the last group of the Polish uprisers.</sentence><sentence id="3606">And they are dragging us through the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3607">We see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in flames, and they are dragging me, I can hardly drag.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3608">And all of us have to put out a handkerchief or something to show to the Germans our surrender.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3609">We had to show something white, flags we didn't have, so everybody raises a hand with a little shirt or something, we're surrendering.</sentence><sentence id="3610">I couldn't walk, people helped me or what, I don't remember.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3611">All I recall, at one <span class="NPIP">point</span>, I was extremely thirsty, probably from loss of blood, and I bent down to pick up an apple.</sentence><sentence id="3612"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is full of orchards, of apple orchards, it was the season for it.</sentence><sentence id="3613">I tried to get an apple into my mouth and a German soldier hits me right in my back, march!</sentence><sentence id="3614">He didn't know I was Jewish, but then I was totally unafraid of being detected as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="3615">I was a Pole.</sentence><sentence id="3616">They marched us to a place outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poroskov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3617">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poroskov</span> they had a special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span> for all the Poles who fought in the uprising and other Poles too.</sentence><sentence id="3618"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> eventually was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poroskov</span> too but I didn't know at that time.</sentence><sentence id="3619">I was so sick that I wish I knew these details because I didn't function mentally anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3620">But I recall waking up, there are somehow or other bodies on top of me.</sentence><sentence id="3621">It was so crowded there that they pushed people, we fell asleep and the bodies, somehow or other I sneaked out of it.</sentence><sentence id="3622">Before I know it, I was on some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> being marched again to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be, anti-loused, means cleaned of lice, a de-lousing station.</sentence><sentence id="3623">And then they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I'm on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with Hel-linka (ph) holding onto each other and with lots of other Poles.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3624">Polish families, not children, Polish men.</sentence><sentence id="3625">On that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and by then it is September I know, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were the only two women and the men are all in Polish uniforms, they were fighters.</sentence><sentence id="3626">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving very slowly, I had no idea where we were moving, we fall asleep all of us.</sentence><sentence id="3627">Sometime in the middle of the night, or it was very early morning, one of the fighters wakes up and he starts talking to the other one, the Jews brought all the tragedy and the Jews will take over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because of the Soviets and they got us into all that trouble.</sentence><sentence id="3628">And one of these guys looks at the other and says, you know what, these two girls across from us, they look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3629">You better tell.</sentence><sentence id="3630">By then it was about four in the morning or so and it was just light, it was just coming, and then they fell asleep.</sentence><sentence id="3631">And without saying another word to Hel-linka (ph), we motioned to each other that we're going to jump from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3632">I'm sure that the motivation was not to escape from that, the</sentence><sentence id="3634">5 motivation I believe, but I'm not sure, was to just die.</sentence><sentence id="3635">Before these Germans come to take us.</sentence><sentence id="3636">We understood by then that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was being shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>, which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span> where Polish people were shipped in order to work for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3637">And we knew the beginning of the day will bring the greatest horrors to us when the Germans arrived to take us out.</sentence><sentence id="3638">So without saying a word to each other, the <span class="DLF">window</span> was open, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving very slowly, I can't remember who jumped first.</sentence><sentence id="3639">And I can't remember anything else except that I wake up in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of a Polish woman in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3640">I never heard of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it's south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3641">These women had attended me, given me a clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, attended to my wounds, told me the story of what happened after I woke up.</sentence><sentence id="3642">I don't know, it was a few days that I was pretty unconscious.</sentence><sentence id="3643">She said that when we jumped out a priest thought we were dead.</sentence><sentence id="3644">He was going to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to bury some body, he saw these two girls from the Warsaw uprising, so he figured he's going to bury us, with a decent Catholic burial.</sentence><sentence id="3645">When he noted that we were breathing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="3646">So first he buried these people who he meant to bury, then he brought us to this Polish woman on the outskirts of Toe-mash-off-maus-off-yetski (ph).</sentence><sentence id="3647">Poor woman but a very decent soul.</sentence><sentence id="3648">She was very happy to be able to be of service to these Polish revolutionaries, the Poles who fought, the Polish fighters who fought for independence of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3649">So she treated us beautifully, I could see how poor she was but she treated us extremely well, and one day a neighbor comes in and she opens the <span class="DLF">door</span> to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and she wants to tell him, these are two girls who were in the Polish resistance movement.</sentence><sentence id="3650">He takes a look at us and he says, she look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3651">That night, Hel-linka (ph) was sick of me because she looked Polish, she said good-bye to me and I haven't seen her until years after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3652">I saw her again about two years after the war.</sentence><sentence id="3653">Hel-linka (ph) had blue eyes and she was blonde and she wanted out.</sentence><sentence id="3654">I stayed on, I didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="3655">The Polish woman was absolutely an angel, she said you have to go, you can't be here.</sentence><sentence id="3656">She wrapped up for me half her bread in a kerchief and two apples and early morning I leave.</sentence><sentence id="3657">I didn't know where I was going but, it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="3658">At that time, nothing mattered anymore.</sentence><sentence id="3659">I knew I wasn't afraid at all because I wasn't Jewish anymore, nobody would think of me as Jewish at that point.</sentence><sentence id="3660"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was falling apart.</sentence><sentence id="3661">I kept walking, so I walked into <span

were, but this man noticed and this woman?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3667">A: That man noticed, but on the whole people were already running and life didn't matter to me.</sentence><sentence id="3668">I was all alone, I was wounded, I had a pain in my back.</sentence><sentence id="3669">I had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="3670">I didn't know where to go, I don't think I had documents at that point because I was running in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span>, I don't remember what happened.</sentence><sentence id="3671">And I don't remember because I was on the high fever.</sentence><sentence id="3672">So I walk into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I see Thom-ma-sla-sov-en-sky (ph), I never heard of it before, there are two Thom-ma-slick's (ph), one is the other is the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Rabbi Lowengers (ph) brother.</sentence><sentence id="3673">They preeminently gave testimony about their experiences as children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3674">So I walk in, I hardly walk, but I walk with the apples and the bread.</sentence><sentence id="3675">I see an <span class="BUILDING">apothecary</span> for <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3676"><span class="BUILDING">European pharmacies</span> are very different than ours, they're very formal.</sentence><sentence id="3677">I had nothing to loose, I walk in, I say I am a, I ran away from the uprising, I fought in the uprising because this was my new identity.</sentence><sentence id="3678">The man, and I know a little bit about pharmacological work because my husband was a pharmacist, I use to help him, he is delighted to see me, he says.</sentence><sentence id="3679">Well, first I wanted to rest up, I wanted to meet my family, tomorrow you come to work.</sentence><sentence id="3680">You can do bottles, you can wash up, fine.</sentence><sentence id="3681">He sends me upstairs to his family, a nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they made, his wife was charming to me, the maid makes a luxurious <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for me, I felt so guilty to get into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with beautifully clean linen.</sentence><sentence id="3682">I haven't seen that in a long time, starched linen I remember.</sentence><sentence id="3683">And they invite me for dinner and everything's fine.</sentence><sentence id="3684">And I sleep through the night and in the morning the maid comes in saying, she's very sorry but her landlady told her how sorry she was but I cannot stay here any longer.</sentence><sentence id="3685">I think, ah-oh, they discovered where I was.</sentence><sentence id="3686">So I say, what happened?</sentence><sentence id="3687">She says, in the morning when you got up I made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, I noticed there were lice in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3688">And my landlady says you should go because you were wounded.</sentence><sentence id="3689">You should go to the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> to clean out your wound.</sentence><sentence id="3690">Well, I still remember laughing to myself, lice!</sentence><sentence id="3691">Anything is better than being discovered as a Jew!</sentence><sentence id="3692">I dragged myself to that <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> and they started working on me and the doctor without any anesthesia they cleaned my wound, it was extremely painful I remember.</sentence><sentence id="3693">I screamed from pain.</sentence><sentence id="3694">And they took out the lice, they cleaned me</sentence><sentence id="3696">7 out totally.</sentence><sentence id="3697">And I hear the nurse saying to the doctor, you know, she looks Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3698">Here I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3699">Nothing happened and nothing mattered at that point, I walked out, I knew I was bandaged.</sentence><sentence id="3700">I didn't have lice.</sentence><sentence id="3701">I figured should I go back there, it's really not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me to go back, I'm afraid.</sentence><sentence id="3702">By then it was very late evening, I was extremely tired.</sentence><sentence id="3703">I was still so very sick.</sentence><sentence id="3704">I ate those apples and the rest of the bread and I stretched out on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3705">It was a cold night, it was by then I think the end of September, beginning of October.</sentence><sentence id="3706">It was raining, drizzling, and I fell asleep and nothing matters.</sentence><sentence id="3707">Sometime in the middle of the night, somebody pushes me.</sentence><sentence id="3708">I open my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="3709">A German soldier, a German policeman.</sentence><sentence id="3710">Come, he says to me.</sentence><sentence id="3711">I wasn't afraid.</sentence><sentence id="3712">He didn't know in the middle of the night that I was Jewish or anything, he was collecting all these homeless people to ship them out to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3713">So he brings me again to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for cleaning, de-lousing, clean, I walk out clean.</sentence><sentence id="3714">I think they gave me something fresh to wear, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="3715">And he brings me to an <span class="BUILDING">assembly hall</span> where there are lots of Polish women.</sentence><sentence id="3716">All these women, collected from the <span class="DLF">street</span>, are being shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work.</sentence><sentence id="3717">By then the Germans were loosing the war, their men where coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on crutches.</sentence><sentence id="3718">Their women were sent to the front to work.</sentence><sentence id="3719">They didn't have enough workers so they were collecting Polish people all over.</sentence><sentence id="3720">I'm among Poles, therefore nobody knows I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="3721">But, we get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and then the man who is a greeter tells us we are going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work but before we do we are going to stop in Pat-o-vich-a (ph), which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> which by then was <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3722">And he takes us out and he says, I want you to sit in this <span class="NPIP">corner</span>, we were a few hundred people by then, to sit in this comer and to wait for the evening.</sentence><sentence id="3723">We are going to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">evening train</span> and I'll come back in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="3724">We know you'll sit and rest here, will being some food.</sentence><sentence id="3725">I took a look at the group and I didn't know whether I looked at them or they looked at me but it didn't look to me kosher that I could survive with these Polish groups.</sentence><sentence id="3726">So I said, if I have to be back and see if I could walk away a little bit, so 1 walked away.</sentence><sentence id="3727">And here I could see <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> falling apart.</sentence><sentence id="3728">Many Polish people of German extraction, falk-stoich-er (ph), are coming into the <span

class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> supervised by German nurses, like the German Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="3731">So I hear their story about how the Soviets are after them, how they ran away</sentence><sentence id="3733">8 from rape and all kinds of things, so I figured, I'm also falk-stoich-er (ph), why not?</sentence><sentence id="3734">I speak German better than they.</sentence><sentence id="3735">So I go over and I ask for soup and I tell them that "m running from the Soviets so they give me one cup of soup and another cup of soup and a third cup of soup.</sentence><sentence id="3736">I remember milk so distinctly, finally I am full, I've eaten good food.</sentence><sentence id="3737">And this is a Sunday afternoon I believe and I walk out of the

it.</sentence><sentence id="3739">And I see the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> full of fabrics, I couldn't believe what's going on here.</sentence><sentence id="3740">I came from the ashes, literally from the ashes of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3741">And I walk and I don't know where to walk, I figure I have to walk away from that Polish group.</sentence><sentence id="3742">Let's see if I can get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span> because I'm wanted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and since everybody's running.</sentence><sentence id="3743">I'm not Jewish, everybody's running, the German, the falk-stoich-er (ph) are running, the Poles are running.</sentence><sentence id="3744">The Poles couldn't run they are too but the Germans were running from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3745">So I see a Hitler parade, and believe it or not, this is the funniest thing in my life!</sentence><sentence id="3746">I joined the Hitler parade and I go like this, Heil Hitler!</sentence><sentence id="3747">Heil Hitler! .</sentence><sentence id="3748">First they had soldiers in brown shoes, but then people talked, it was Sunday afternoon, I think it was for Hitler's birthday, I'm not sure, but it was a special occasion.</sentence><sentence id="3749">So I walked with them until the evening, then they disperse.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3837">Q: What's your state of mind when you joined this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parade</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3839">A: Oh, I was so exhilarated.</sentence><sentence id="3840">I was absolutely exhilarated.</sentence><sentence id="3841">Imagine me to join a Hitler parade!</sentence><sentence id="3842">I'm in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>!</sentence><sentence id="3843">This still brings to me laughter whenever I think about that moment!</sentence><sentence id="3844">How did I do it, but what else could I do?</sentence><sentence id="3845">I was in the safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be for me.</sentence><sentence id="3846">In a Hitler parade!</sentence><sentence id="3847">I'm together with all these Germans saluting the flag and all the things, and there are speeches and so on.</sentence><sentence id="3848">Many hours pass and the evening comes and they begin to disperse, so I have no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="3849">I figured these Poles must have left, but I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="3850">So I circle around the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3851">I wasn't afraid because people were on the march by then you see.</sentence><sentence id="3852">They were refugees.</sentence><sentence id="3853">This was the best feeling for me.</sentence><sentence id="3854">I come back, indeed, the people are gone.</sentence><sentence id="3855">So I take a look, what am I going to do?</sentence><sentence id="3856">Now ["Il try to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and find my way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, I knew Blancka was there.</sentence><sentence id="3857">I had some idea of where, the place where people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bolm-sukkot</span> (ph) worked.</sentence><sentence id="3858">I got to, it's late evening by then, I get ona</sentence><sentence id="3860">9 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I suddenly notice the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military train</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, the Germans, all military, I'm the only woman.</sentence><sentence id="3861">I say, oh, that's very dangerous, so | hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3862">In an hour or so, they need the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> and start yelling to get out, I get out, they look at me, and by sheer luck because I have to think it was luck you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops.</sentence><sentence id="3863">It was the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3864">So I walk out at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> goes away, it goes wherever they went.</sentence><sentence id="3865">I walk, it was very quiet I remember.</sentence><sentence id="3866">It was by then, was morning, early morning hours.</sentence><sentence id="3867">I walk into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I sit down in a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span>, I didn't have money but I figure I would sit down, rest stop.</sentence><sentence id="3868">And so the new bombs came.</sentence><sentence id="3869">This was the great bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>, it was an earlier bombing.</sentence><sentence id="3870">You see R-A-F, this was the British Air Force.</sentence><sentence id="3871">The best feeling in this world, that I'm going to die of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomb</span>, what can be better?</sentence><sentence id="3872">I remember even bombs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3873">At one point, the British were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and I stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> there, not with the Germans, it was in a <span class="NPIP">Polish place</span>, I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span>, and people were running to shelter.</sentence><sentence id="3874">So these people called me, come!</sentence><sentence id="3875">Come with us to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>!</sentence><sentence id="3876">And I did everything possible not to go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span>, I wanted to be killed by a bomb.</sentence><sentence id="3877">Couldn't be a better death.</sentence><sentence id="3878">And I recall doing this, putting my feet up and my head into my legs, hoping that when a bomb kills me that it will kill all of me rather than just some legs or the head separates.</sentence><sentence id="3879">This was my dream, to be killed that way.</sentence><sentence id="3880">I really didn't want to live, so when people say they tried to survive, they wanted to live, I really didn't want to live but I didn't want to die detected by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="3881">I was afraid of that <span class="NPIP">death</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3882">But I've seen before how people were killed and their leg was hung there and I was there and this to me was a horror, so I remember that night of bombing.</sentence><sentence id="3883">I didn't go to the <span class="DLF">shelter</span> but I waited for the bomb, the bomb didn't come to me.</sentence><sentence id="3884">So this is Desden, and I sit in a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> is coming down and I'm sitting there literally, seeing the bombs, and things happen, it's like an earth-sukkotke, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3885">It sounds like an earth- sukkotke.</sentence><sentence id="3886">And I see many people are dead in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and here I walk out alive.</sentence><sentence id="3887">I was meant to live and that's all they can say, why I wasn't killed I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3888">So hours later, I walked down to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3889">I still have in mind if I'm alive I want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, so I get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3890">It was some sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">civilian train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3891">Nobody looked at documents, nobody looked at tickets, it was so chaotic.</sentence><sentence id="3892">It was mainly refugees from the falk-stoic-er (ph), from everywhere, and Germans too</sentence><sentence id="3894">0 from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, there were bombs, they were moving west, that's how it was going.</sentence><sentence id="3895">But mainly from the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which was originally <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3896">Finally I see this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stops at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and before I get out bombs come over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>, this was a little bit too much, unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="3897">But this was the time of the greatest bombing of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3898">So the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> is all in fire again and many passengers walk out alive and many passengers are killed right there.</sentence><sentence id="3899">And I'm alive.</sentence><sentence id="3900">It's fantastic!</sentence><sentence id="3901">So I figured, now I have to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, certainly no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> anymore, the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> is all in flames.</sentence><sentence id="3902">I see people walking, I follow them, they are walking to the <span class="DLF">highway</span> to hitchhike.</sentence><sentence id="3903">So I hitchhike too, I'm a German you know!</sentence><sentence id="3904">I'm a falk- stoich-er (ph), poor, dear soul.</sentence><sentence id="3905">I'm better qualified to be falk-stoich-er (ph) than anybody else here because those who live for generations in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is falk-stoich-er (ph), that and German, they didn't speak German they didn't know a thing.</sentence><sentence id="3906">I'm certainly much more , So I go with them.</sentence><sentence id="3907">And they start hitchhiking, so I get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> goes only a little <span class="NPIP">place</span>, he leaves me there, I had to hitchhike again.</sentence><sentence id="3908">Must have been six modes of transportation, finally a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> goes somewhere between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3909">I arrive at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, I arrive intact in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3910">I walk into the <span class="INT_SPACE">ladies room</span> to wash up and I wash up and I look in the mirror and I see a <span class="DLF">chimney</span> behind me, a chimney sweep, and I figure how does a man come into this?</sentence><sentence id="3911">I look around, he's gone.</sentence><sentence id="3912">So, I wash my hands again, I look again and I see the chimney sweep is back!And I look back, it's not a chimney sweep.</sentence><sentence id="3913">What happened?</sentence><sentence id="3914">I did this with my hands and I noticed it was me, not a chimney sweep!</sentence><sentence id="3915">I was so black, I was so totally black covered with soot.</sentence><sentence id="3916">And it was my face, it was not a chimney sweep. .</sentence><sentence id="3917">I wash my face, I suddenly had a face and it was me.</sentence><sentence id="3918">I still have that sense of terror in me when I think about it.</sentence><sentence id="3919">I walk out, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is normal and beautiful and it was the month of October.</sentence><sentence id="3920">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, October as you recall here is lovely, the weather is lovely, it's not cold.</sentence><sentence id="3921">I'm without stockings and wooden shoes and the coat through which went the bullet.</sentence><sentence id="3922">And I walk and I cannot believe my eyes.</sentence><sentence id="3923">And I see some Germans, former soldiers on crutches, a few women.</sentence><sentence id="3924">And I just keep walking towards the necht-a-some-a- risa (ph) because in walking toward the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>'s center, usually it goes down the center of the <span class="DLF">street</span>, you just walk.</sentence><sentence id="3925">Here I see the neck-er (ph) and I figure how can I find out where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blancka</span> is?</sentence><sentence id="3928">1 remember the name of her employer.</sentence><sentence id="3929">So I stop a little girl and I say to her, do you know Mr. Alber (ph)?</sentence><sentence id="3930">And she says, My papa!</sentence><sentence id="3931">Like that.</sentence><sentence id="3932">There are miracles in this world.</sentence><sentence id="3933">My papa!</sentence><sentence id="3934">She takes me by my hand and she brings me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Blancka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3935">Blancka nearly fainted when she saw me the way I looked.</sentence><sentence id="3936">She took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to wash me up and put something around my wounds, I was not in such good sukkotpe yet, and she figured I should wait a few days before I go to work.</sentence><sentence id="3937">She had meanwhile arranged for me to work for a couple, for a family, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3938">This was no one else but Professor A-had-es (ph), he was a dean of the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3939">A high ranking German official in a uniform, he was about 7" tall.</sentence><sentence id="3940">He has a wife with four children, a stunning <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, absolutely beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3941">There were <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">attics</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3942">They hired me on the spot, I started working.</sentence><sentence id="3943">The work was impossible for me, I was not well yet you see?</sentence><sentence id="3944">And they gave me an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3945">I had to get the children, clean everything, there were many <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> there, beautiful, their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3946">And in the morning I would have to get the children to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, each child leaving for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the, Heil Hitler, Maria!</sentence><sentence id="3947">This was the greeting, the morning greeting.</sentence><sentence id="3948">The lady of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was sort of neutral.</sentence><sentence id="3949">She didn't trust me with cooking, there was nothing to cook.</sentence><sentence id="3950">It was toward the end of the war, the Germans had very little, but they had a <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3951">Everyday, I had to go to the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and dig out potatoes and leek.</sentence><sentence id="3952">And everyday, we had an elegant lunch of potatoes and leeks.</sentence><sentence id="3953">I would scrape it off, prepare it, but she would cook it because you put a little bit butter and a little flour and make it look like more of a meal.</sentence><sentence id="3954">It was served in beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">porcelain</span> with silverware, you would never think what you were eating, it was great food.</sentence><sentence id="3955">Everyday the same until the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="3956">We had all, for getting rations of food.</sentence><sentence id="3957">Everybody was assigned that many grams of bread, so I had a little.</sentence><sentence id="3958">He registered me as a falk-stoich-er (ph), which was great.</sentence><sentence id="3959">So which means I was entitled to a little bit more bread.</sentence><sentence id="3960">So, I would get whatever amount of bread, just a little bit less than they did.</sentence><sentence id="3961">On Sunday, everybody had pork.</sentence><sentence id="3962">A roast of pork and the Professor would slice it, trying to be fair to everyone.</sentence><sentence id="3963">Then he would slice a somewhat thinner part, this is for Maria!</sentence><sentence id="3964">He didn't know much German, I knew, because just spoke it haltingly in a way, because she gets a little less.</sentence><sentence id="3965">But, I still had a portion.</sentence><sentence id="3966">This was one soup, they didn't have either, except that he went a few times to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> on trips.</sentence><sentence id="3967">And he would bring some peaches from</sentence><sentence id="3969">2 there and he brought some assortment of foods.</sentence><sentence id="3970">Well, this <span class="BUILDING">household</span> was a very elegant <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3971">They would have culture evenings, evenings of culture.</sentence><sentence id="3972">At which point they would invite about 20, 30 people like a symphony orchestra they would play.</sentence><sentence id="3973">These were doctors most of them, famous lawyers, jewelers, you know?</sentence><sentence id="3974">And I would set up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and everybody would get a little bit coffee or something but everything was very elegant.</sentence><sentence id="3975">The setting was always very elegant.</sentence><sentence id="3976">One day, he comes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from one of his sudden trips and he brings some very special food and the lady wraps it up on a tray and she says to me to go to that neighbor, to bring a present from the El-hades (ph) family.</sentence><sentence id="3977">I walk there, one of the most stunning <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> I've ever seen, I couldn't believe the <span class="DLF">garden</span> at that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3978">I ring the bell and the maid says, no, no, the maid's entrance is through the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3979">I come into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I leave that present.</sentence><sentence id="3980">Then I find out who now was this family, was Speer.</sentence><sentence id="3981">Albert Speer's parents.</sentence><sentence id="3982">I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="3983">They gave me the name Speer, the name Speer didn't mean anything to me.</sentence><sentence id="3984">They want the movement between history and personal experience but that's true for all survivors.</sentence><sentence id="3985">Well, it was an extremely beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, something like our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scotishville</span> (ph), a very fine section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3986">And Blancka worked in her <span class="BUILDING">household</span> and I worked in mine.</sentence><sentence id="3987">For me the work was unbelievably heavy, I couldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="3988">I just didn't have the strength of rolling out these very heavy rugs, carpets.</sentence><sentence id="3989">Putting them on the snow and beating them on the snow because most Europeans believed that when you beat these heavy carpets on the snow that they get special treatment.</sentence><sentence id="3990">To roll it up, to carry it from this, one day I remember I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, allied <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying over, very much over me.</sentence><sentence id="3991">I could nearly talk to them, I felt it was so, but I felt that day I remember, gee, the Americans are coming, or the British, or whoever it was, but I won't live to see them, I was so sick of work, I was so tired of work.</sentence><sentence id="3992">One day I fell off the <span class="DLF">stairway</span>, they had <span class="DLF">stairways</span> to different <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3993">And I ripped my face and I think I had a few days of rest and a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, the best time of my life!</sentence><sentence id="3994">I needed the rest so bad.</sentence><sentence id="3995">To dig out in the cold snow, to dig out potatoes everyday.</sentence><sentence id="3996">To take care of four children.</sentence><sentence id="3997">To do the laundry.</sentence><sentence id="3998">To clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3999">To beat those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carpets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4000">All of this was a little bit too much for one person.</sentence><sentence id="4001">Blancka was with six children and the German lord's point was if a woman has a family of six children they were entitled to one and a half help.</sentence><sentence id="4002">If they had four children you were entitled to a foreign worker, I was a foreign</sentence><sentence id="4004">3 worker.</sentence><sentence id="4005">If you had eight children you were entitled to two, if you had six you were entitled to one and a half.</sentence><sentence id="4006">So Blancka had another half there, that half later we found out was also Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="4007">She still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tacoma</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, I knew her.</sentence><sentence id="4008">Blancka and I were very closely related in terms of our days off.</sentence><sentence id="4009">Our day off was Wednesday afternoon and occasionally we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span>, sneak in, but most of the time we would go to this beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> because their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> was in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4010">Most beautiful section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4011">There was a lovely <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> called Bros-pron-eur (ph).It was cut out of an idyllic kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4012">It wasn't true, it wasn't possible.</sentence><sentence id="4013">That is the place when we heard that the Germans have plans, according to their plans that they withdrew, they withdrew from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4014">These were the news we would get, we knew that they were loosing.</sentence><sentence id="4015">But it was still very much inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and little by little I felt I probably will not survive the heavy labor.</sentence><sentence id="4016">I was not afraid of being detected because I was only afraid of the Poles, I was not, the Germans wouldn't know the difference, that's a fact.</sentence><sentence id="4017">But going down to <span class="BUILDING">market</span> for them and all these things, it was uphill, it was very difficult to carry all of that.</sentence><sentence id="4018">But I thought I would survive the war if I could survive my health.</sentence><sentence id="4019">I couldn't take that heavy labor.</sentence><sentence id="4020">Well, one day, the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> comes in and he says, it looks as though there is some fighting going on, we would be better off being in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="4021">Not to stay above because you could see all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4022">I didn't listen to the radio, I didn't know much, but I got it from their faces that things are not going well for the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="4023">I didn't know how close.</sentence><sentence id="4024">So he said that night we should stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4025">So we all go down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and sometime early morning I see this man, who always wore the high military uniform, he use to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> with Hitler, you know, he was a very big shot.</sentence><sentence id="4026">But he's in his civilian clothes, it hangs on him it just looks like a diminished man.</sentence><sentence id="4027">And he drive out of the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> has a little white flag.</sentence><sentence id="4028">And I still don't understand what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="4029">Later in the morning, he comes back with a little bandage over his hand, he was wounded slightly in the street fight.</sentence><sentence id="4030">He and the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and somebody else went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> to surrender the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span> to the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="4031">That's a great moment, I have

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4314">Q: You mean the Americans were marching?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4319">A: The Americans, yes.</sentence><sentence id="4320">So I figured something may happen.</sentence><sentence id="4321">A night or two nights before, he wanted me to dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> where he put some guns.</sentence><sentence id="4322">He hid guns there.</sentence><sentence id="4323">And Blanca's people hid wine.</sentence><sentence id="4324">Bottles of wine.</sentence><sentence id="4325">They were prepared for the Americans, you know, so the Americans may want, he hid guns there.</sentence><sentence id="4326">And I figured it's not good for me to be there at this point.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4327">We didn't know where to go.</sentence><sentence id="4328">I said to Blancka, I say, "m not working anymore.</sentence><sentence id="4329">She says, I'm not working either.</sentence><sentence id="4330">We go down to look at these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> keep rolling, but we have no money, there's no money, there's nothing to buy.</sentence><sentence id="4331">We went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, everything is closed.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4332"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelburg</span> is totally closed up, not one <span class="BUILDING">store</span> is open.</sentence><sentence id="4333">And so we decided to live in these <span class="DLF">fields</span> near the <span class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4334">We slept there and we ate grass.</sentence><sentence id="4335">I'll never forget after the war, the first few days we ate <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4336">It's hard to believe it.</sentence><sentence id="4337">We decided not to go back.</sentence><sentence id="4338">And there was nothing to do but on the third day I think we realized perhaps we could do something with these cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="4339">So we walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and indeed, we knocked at the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and we told, cigarettes, cigarettes, trading something, and they gave us some food.</sentence><sentence id="4340">Finally we found our way to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, an American Red Cross club.</sentence><sentence id="4341">That <span class="NPIP">place</span> was to serve donuts and coffee to American soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="4342">It must have been within a week or two, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="4343">We told the guys that we were Jewish and that we were slave laborers here and could they do something for us, could they give us a job?</sentence><sentence id="4344">They agreed to have us serve the boys.</sentence><sentence id="4345">So if I speak English in a funny way, that's the place where I picked up my English.</sentence><sentence id="4346">I never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, this was my <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4347">I served coffee and donuts and Blancka too.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4348">Was a great life.</sentence><sentence id="4349">We got a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> because for the <span class="BUILDING">donuts</span> we were able to trade.</sentence><sentence id="4350">We brought dozens of <span class="BUILDING">donuts</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they had a furnished room all ready.</sentence><sentence id="4351">Then we decided we need to learn English.</sentence><sentence id="4352">So we went to a German woman who was a teacher of English.</sentence><sentence id="4353">Gave her a dozen of donuts and she taught us English.</sentence><sentence id="4354">To the <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> for donuts, everything was for donuts because there was no food and we had access to as many donuts as we wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="4355">So this put us on our feet.</sentence><sentence id="4356">One day, a man comes in, in an outfit from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, I had no idea where he was from, but he wore one of these pajamas and he told us he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, told us his story.</sentence><sentence id="4357">And he says, he needs to talk to the military governor, he needs some document to go and find his wife, but he doesn't speak English.</sentence><sentence id="4358">So I said, I speak English, I'll</sentence><sentence id="4360">6 take you there.</sentence><sentence id="4361">I come to the military governor and he has refugee assistant and I interpret for this man and the military governor turns to his assistant and says, what language does she speak?</sentence><sentence id="4362">That was my English.</sentence><sentence id="4363">I stopped going for English lessons to this woman, she taught me in a way that was no English!</sentence><sentence id="4364">I thought I spoke English.</sentence><sentence id="4365">Slowly I learned the language and slowly a man came in from underground, Mr. Volinger (ph), and he started helping us in whatever way.</sentence><sentence id="4366">Eventually, they organized, the American Red Cross organized a transport of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to go to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and to bring back the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, from, and they were inthe _--_--.----Heidleburg, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span>, some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4367">And they ask if anybody speaks Russian, I volunteer to speak Russian.</sentence><sentence id="4368">So they attach me, they put me in a uniform, some American soldiers uniform, and I go with them to Trencin-sch-stat (ph) and I say, before you go we have to cross <span class="DLF">Russian borders</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4369">We have to take cha-socks (ph), watches and a lot of Vodka.</sentence><sentence id="4370">They don't understand, I say, trust me.</sentence><sentence id="4371">That is what we will need.</sentence><sentence id="4372">Well, the minute we cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, they immediately saw these soldiers and they don't let us through.</sentence><sentence id="4373">We need a stamp and that stamp, a round stamp, a green stamp.</sentence><sentence id="4374">I say, don't bother with them, just give them the cha-socks (ph), well, they salute us, we go further.</sentence><sentence id="4375">We get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.230301578275" long="12.8682579509542">Karlsbad</span>, where my sister use to live.</sentence><sentence id="4376">We come there, they cannot let us through because we don't have the right kind of a stamp.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4377">We have a square stamp, they want a round stamp.</sentence><sentence id="4378">And I say, where is your supervisor?</sentence><sentence id="4379">Oh, he's taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4380">A <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>?</sentence><sentence id="4381">We'll wait.</sentence><sentence id="4382">They say, oh no, he likes to be in the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> the whole day and the whole night.</sentence><sentence id="4383">So, I figure that's no way, this cost a lot of Vodka and cha-socks (ph), but we went further.</sentence><sentence id="4384">Finally, it was evening, we arrive in Tilsit-en-shot (ph), it's high up.</sentence><sentence id="4385">This scene I'll never forget again.</sentence><sentence id="4386">We come with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">busses</span> actually.</sentence><sentence id="4387">And we had a list of people who were deported to Trencin-en-shot (ph), hundreds of thousands of names, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4388">They had, the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> had collected it.</sentence><sentence id="4389">There's a big, big <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, it's towards the evening, and we see people sort of sukkotking.</sentence><sentence id="4390">These people were in a coma of dying.</sentence><sentence id="4391">The Soviets brought in food which they couldn't digest.</sentence><sentence id="4392">It was a terrible scene and I have that list and they cannot read the list, they don't know who's alive, who's not.</sentence><sentence id="4393">Before I know, a Soviet policeman, a soldier policeman, puts his hands on my shoulders, he says, please follow me.</sentence><sentence id="4394">He gets me into the big <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>, an empty</sentence><sentence id="4396">7 <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, a tremendous <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4397">It's all dark.</sentence><sentence id="4398">He says, wait here, I should wait.</sentence><sentence id="4399">He locks the <span class="DLF">door</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I'm all alone in that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4400">It was a horror.</sentence><sentence id="4401">My only thought was, in the morning, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> will pick me up and I'll go to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> because that was the Russian way.</sentence><sentence id="4402">I didn't want to lie down, I was standing because I was afraid of rats.</sentence><sentence id="4403">I was standing there the whole night, waiting for the morning to be taken out, no matter where.</sentence><sentence id="4404">He comes in the morning, he takes me out, he brings me back to the <span class="BUILDING">American Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4405">Until today, I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="4406">I assume, because I spoke Russian and I wore an American uniform, that they took me for a spy.</sentence><sentence id="4407">Or perhaps these guys intervened for me, I still don't know.</sentence><sentence id="4408">We came back with a handful of people, the worst of people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span> from these <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4409">All I recall, when I crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="REGION">German territory</span>, I nearly kissed the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4410">That was how you do with <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4411">There, I met two girls in Russian uniforms from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4412">They were in the army, they work with the victorious armies, they were marching.</sentence><sentence id="4413">And they told me that they saw Blanca's husband in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>".</sentence><sentence id="4414">So, I told that he come back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, I told Blancka about it, she could hardly wait.</sentence><sentence id="4415">She wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>" to meet her husband, naturally.</sentence><sentence id="4416">So we both leave the job at the <span class="BUILDING">American Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4417">There was a big repatriation movement then, they were patroiting all of these people to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> load of Poles coming back from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as slave labors into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4418">And all that talk you hear is anti-Semitic talk in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4419">We were just about to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I hear these comments and it was a stop for us.</sentence><sentence id="4420">I say to Blancka, you know what?</sentence><sentence id="4421">I'm not going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4422">I couldn't go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, I couldn't hear that talk.</sentence><sentence id="4423">Here I was already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, in a way, the American Red Cross.</sentence><sentence id="4424">She was quite desperate about our separation, but she went, she wanted to find her husband.</sentence><sentence id="4425">She comes to herself later, she found her husband with another woman.</sentence><sentence id="4426">He married a woman in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4427">Anyway, so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4428">I stayed a while.</sentence><sentence id="4429">Somehow or other, they had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camps</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="4430">I was going from one into another.</sentence><sentence id="4431">One day, I work for Ohrdruf, from the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ohrdruf</span> because I spoke languages.</sentence><sentence id="4432">I knew a little English by then, I knew Polish, I knew German, so I was useful in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4433">And somebody approaches me saying, is there a Maria Neider here?</sentence><sentence id="4434">Maria Neider!</sentence><sentence id="4435">Menek</sentence><sentence id="4437">8 phoned.</sentence><sentence id="4438">He literally walked through <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from, so this was, how do you know?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4439">It's Menek and he brought news that Frania is alive and he mentioned that they all came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I got them a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span> because I had the rations, food, I had all that stuff.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4440">I'm in the uniform, you saw my years of .</sentence><sentence id="4441">And they sent me to A-rose-en (ph), after I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> first.</sentence><sentence id="4442"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hurst</span>, that was the only <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was the <span class="DLF">G.I. farm</span> and <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4443">The only <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> the Americans left intact in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> because they thought they'Il need it for their military government later, so it was.</sentence><sentence id="4444">So I worked there, Menek found me there.</sentence><sentence id="4445">And then they transported all of unknown people to A-rose-en (ph).</sentence><sentence id="4446">They had the Germans leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Castle</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="4447">There was big <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> there, big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4448">And Own- Rae (ph) took over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4449">And they sent me there and I had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with another woman from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, she was of Polish origin, Maria Leiberskint.</sentence><sentence id="4450">We lived there and life was pretty good.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4451">And my sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidleburg</span>, I would commute and bring food, I would always bring all these things.</sentence><sentence id="4452">I had a very interesting job, it was in the tracing, we were tracing children who were dispersed into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4453">No Jewish children were in question.</sentence><sentence id="4454">But representatives of different governments, Polish, Yugoslavian, Hungarian, Croatian, you just name it, they came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">zone</span> to claim the children.</sentence><sentence id="4455">They wanted to find their children.</sentence><sentence id="4456">And the job of the Onrah (ph) personnel which I supervised for no good reason but that I knew the languages and I had an education, all of this worked in my favor.</sentence><sentence id="4457">They were field workers to find children.</sentence><sentence id="4458">Many of these children didn't speak any of their native languages, you had to identify them by some symbols or whatever.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4459">Sometimes they uttered a word, sometimes they wore a cross which looked like a Slavonic thing.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4460">Some of these things, we found many of them.</sentence><sentence id="4461">And we would always bring them to the attention of these liaisons from their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and they were shipped immediately to their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4462">Today I am not sure I would do that as easily because you wanted to put children and were already observed by German families, what that separation meant, but those days there was no question that these children have to be removed from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the belong to their families.</sentence><sentence id="4463">Sometimes the families were not available, but they belonged to their <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span>, to their <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4464">So these things, my staff went to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to find them, to <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>, to <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span>, certainly it was most difficult with</sentence></p><p><sentence id="4467">9 families because families didn't want to tell us and it was detective work to find, because these kids were so assimilated into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that they spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="4468">Depending on the age too, all the children we could find easily.</sentence><sentence id="4469">This was my job for a very, this was 1945, 1946, and there was plenty of food.</sentence><sentence id="4470">I had a uniform of an American, Under Second Class because the First Class was those who came from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> or from the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4471">These were Second Class, locally hired people, but we had all the privileges.</sentence><sentence id="4472">And one day, a man comes and sits with me in that <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> there where we had very

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4491">A: Not at that point at all.</sentence><sentence id="4492">That's modern history.</sentence><sentence id="4493">Joint Distribution Committee was

start feeding them, locating their relatives perhaps in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, help them with immigration, so they took out the Jewish displaced persons from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4505">And they brought them into their

was well up to a point, the last few days I was sick too.</sentence><sentence id="4855">And then suddenly there is a great, jubilant voice all over.</sentence><sentence id="4856">We see the <span class="BUILDING">Statue of Liberty</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4857">This too are great moments.</sentence><sentence id="4858">It was Saturday night and they wouldn't unload us because on Sunday the workers didn't work at the <span class="DLF">dock</span> or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="4859">It didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="4860">We were all well by then.</sentence><sentence id="4861">People's sickness stopped since the voyage stopped.</sentence><sentence id="4862">And that <span class="BUILDING">Statue of Liberty</span> was the greatest sight in the world!</sentence><sentence id="4863">Well, I was, my sister was there waiting for me, and my brother-in-law and another friend, they took me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span>, they had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4864">They wrote me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they live on <span class="DLF">Garden Street</span> in the <span

them barefoot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5037">Q: Where, near the <span class="BUILDING">Bronx Zoo</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5039">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="5040">Right across, off <span class="DLF">Southern Blvd</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5041">between <span class="DLF">183rd Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5042">I had the bare feet, I walk up, a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but anyway, all I wanted was to run back, but where do you go back, ever?</sentence><sentence id="5043">Well, eventually it worked out.</sentence><sentence id="5044">We were struggling financially, very much.</sentence><sentence id="5045">Sending half of our earnings, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Menek</span> later because for weeks he was hungry there.</sentence><sentence id="5046">It is unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="5047">The Swiss Jewish Community, I cannot forgive for it.</sentence><sentence id="5048">But then I got a job, I immediately got a job.</sentence><sentence id="5049">I don't know how immediately I got the job.</sentence><sentence id="5050">The Joint send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal.</sentence><sentence id="5051">By the way, later on I suddenly get a check of a lot of money, $1300, in 1947, $1300 was a fantastic amount of money in my book!</sentence><sentence id="5052">They paid me for the time I worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5053">They never told me they would pay</sentence><sentence id="5055">8 me.</sentence><sentence id="5056">This happens to be their good personnel policies, this I found out later.</sentence><sentence id="5057"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Loy-ja</span> (ph) worked for them for years.</sentence><sentence id="5058">She still feels it, she has been treated extremely well.</sentence><sentence id="5059">They send me no job, they send me to the Knights of Jewish Appeal as a clerk.</sentence><sentence id="5060">Very dull work, terribly dull work.</sentence><sentence id="5061">But I remember the day when a telegram was sent to every employee, that they reached their quota of $250 million dollars, in 1947, signed by Morgan-tow (ph).</sentence><sentence id="5062">Henry Morgan-tow (ph) was the chief of the UJA then.</sentence><sentence id="5063">And here it said that the executive director was Henry Montor (ph), I don't know if you know the name, it was a big name in those days.</sentence><sentence id="5064">You deal with forty, sixty bro-ter (ph), Henry Montor(ph) was in charge of the UJA.</sentence><sentence id="5065">One day, he has a fall out with his, with Morgan-tow (ph) so they had to separate.</sentence><sentence id="5066">So Morgan-tow (ph) remains as the director of the UJA and Montor (ph) goes to another organization called the Palestine Economic Operation.</sentence><sentence id="5067">They have been in business for a long time, about the <span class="DLF">waterways</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5068">The Director of Personnel at the <span class="BUILDING">UJA</span>, Montor (ph) took her with him, to the other organization.</sentence><sentence id="5069">And she took me.</sentence><sentence id="5070">So I ended up there.</sentence><sentence id="5071">It was ina <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which doesn't exist anymore across the <span class="BUILDING">Waldolf Astoria</span>, it was a fine job, the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were air conditioned.</sentence><sentence id="5072">They made me the archivist there.</sentence><sentence id="5073">For some reason I like it because I was very quick in getting the files they needed.</sentence><sentence id="5074">It was a good time until one day I had, I lived already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by there, until one day I get this call from the United Service for New Americans, which is known NYANA, New York Association for New Americans.</sentence><sentence id="5075">They've always been in the business of helping refugees.</sentence><sentence id="5076">And they say, when I first came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I had one visit with them, asking for work, and they said, what I want to do?</sentence><sentence id="5077">So I said, what I want to do was what I did for the Joint in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5078">They say, oh no, this is social work, for this you need a degree.</sentence><sentence id="5079">They were stupid because I had languages and all these displaced persons they were serving they needed a person like me that spoke these languages, they didn't even stop.</sentence><sentence id="5080">So they say, a new school of social work is opening up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Adell-fy</span> (ph) and the Dean was with honor in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and he wants to give a Jewish scholarship to a displaced person.</sentence><sentence id="5081">And we have many, many candidates who are more qualified than you are, but we will include you if you want to.</sentence><sentence id="5082">I thought about it, I didn't want to give up the job, I had a good paying job.</sentence><sentence id="5083">This was another experience, which doesn't exist anymore.</sentence><sentence id="5084">Since it was a new <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, they had to be more pious than the Pope.</sentence><sentence id="5085">So they interviewed each candidate for</sentence><sentence id="5087">9 six days, for five days.</sentence><sentence id="5088">Every day another interview.</sentence><sentence id="5089">Until it came to Dr. Serrett (ph), who was a very famous psychiatrist for the National Schools of Social Work.</sentence><sentence id="5090">I didn't know a thing about social work.</sentence><sentence id="5091">And he interviewed me, he wanted to know my childhood and everything.</sentence><sentence id="5092">Just to put it on record.</sentence><sentence id="5093">They were so limited, they never asked me about my Holocaust experience.</sentence><sentence id="5094">My childhood, my relation with my mother, my relation with my father, my relation with my siblings.</sentence><sentence id="5095">This took hours and hours, everyday an interview.</sentence><sentence id="5096">The final one with Dr. Serrett (ph) and he apparently approved so I got in.</sentence><sentence id="5097">But to the sukkotme of the psychiatry profession, that nobody asked about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5098">It was a non-subject in those days.</sentence><sentence id="5099">This was 1949, 1950.</sentence><sentence id="5100">Well, for some reason he chose me and I got in and I was very unhappy.</sentence><sentence id="5101">I didn't understand what this study was all about.</sentence><sentence id="5102">He usually came from the study of sociology, psychology, I was student of Polish literature.</sentence><sentence id="5103">They talked language which I didn't understand and I figured, how can I withdraw, how will I get my old job back?</sentence><sentence id="5104">It was very painful to me until the second semester, things began to go extremely well, let's put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="5105">Nothing helps like a little success and a teacher just read my paper, which I thought was nothing, they all thought was excellent.</sentence><sentence id="5106">Anyway, it was great and I was graded very well.</sentence><sentence id="5107">So this is how I got into the profession.</sentence><sentence id="5108">I had no money.</sentence><sentence id="5109">I lived in a, it was amazing, with a Jewish family in, near <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5110">Six dollars a week, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="5111">I didn't have enough money to live.</sentence><sentence id="5112">My scholarship was paid by the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> but there was a foundation for Jewish girls and they were giving me $25 a week, which would have lasted except that my field work in social work, three days a week you have to be in the <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5113">And this idiot arranged my field work to be <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5114">So I had a lot of expenses and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Adel-fy</span> (ph) so $20 or whatever, $18 of that money went for travel.</sentence><sentence id="5115">When I was finally selected by the committee to enter the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the dean congratulated me and he asked me whether I want to study case work, and I didn't know what case work was, so I say, what does social work have to do with cheese?</sentence><sentence id="5116">Because case in German means cheese!</sentence><sentence id="5117">He started laughing and was still laughing when I left, this was my preparation for social work, but I made it.</sentence><sentence id="5118">And I did well.</sentence><sentence id="5119">My second placement, they helped me, also in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5120">They couldn't find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, they were very stupid about it.</sentence><sentence id="5121">It was in a <span class="BUILDING">State Psychiatric Hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5122">Which means that I had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board</sentence><sentence id="5124">0 there.</sentence><sentence id="5125">I lived there, and every psychiatric condition I immediately absorbed as my own.</sentence><sentence id="5126">So one week I was schizophrenic, the next week I was manic depressive.</sentence><sentence id="5127">It was very hard on me but it was the second year and I hadn't done very well, so I graduated anyway.</sentence><sentence id="5128">Since then I've had good jobs and been a social worker since then.</sentence><sentence id="5129">I retired.</sentence><sentence id="5130">I actually worked for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, for the Federal Government, I worked for nine years for the National Institute of Mental Health.</sentence><sentence id="5131">These were special projects and drug addition.</sentence><sentence id="5132">And I was a supervisor in a big <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> then and I use to commute and come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and they were very large with money.</sentence><sentence id="5133">This was the end of 1950's, early 1960's.</sentence><sentence id="5134">Johnson's programs spent a lot of money for rehabilitation, for human services.</sentence><sentence id="5135">They insisted I should travel first class because I had a high rank, GS-12 in those days were the high rank.</sentence><sentence id="5136">It was not becoming for a person with this GS grade to, not to go in important ways.</sentence><sentence id="5137">Anyway, there was a lot of stupid money spending.</sentence><sentence id="5138">We didn't rehabilitate too many people I can tell you, but it was an easy job and prestigious job.</sentence><sentence id="5139">They sent me to be trained at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span>, <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> where they had the United States Public Health Hospital for tubercular diseases later on.</sentence><sentence id="5140">Our job was to visit every <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, open up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for drug addicts.</sentence><sentence id="5141">We did it, it was a whole new thing.</sentence><sentence id="5142">A new ball game for me totally, but we accomplished a lot in this respect, not that drug addicts were not rehabilitated easily but I have been involved in it for many years.</sentence><sentence id="5143">And then one day, again, I was re-married in 1962 and my husband was a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="5144">He had long vacations, he wanted his wife to go on vacations but I only had four weeks.</sentence><sentence id="5145">One day we came back from a summer vacation, there's a letter from the then Dean of the School of Social Work at Tall-a-dot (ph) who remembered me because he was my research professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Adel-fy</span> (ph).It was a new <span class="BUILDING">school</span> then, he asked that I join the faculty it was that easy.</sentence><sentence id="5146">In these days, you would have to have all kinds of qualifications.</sentence><sentence id="5147">What happened, somewhere or other, for many years after I graduated, they used that paper for a record to teach from so they remembered me this way.</sentence><sentence id="5148">It was very hard at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hunter</span> from the first.</sentence><sentence id="5149">I didn't want to give up my job as an AMH but they were very generous with me so they permitted me to work half time only for five years.</sentence><sentence id="5150">The first five years were full time, and then four years later, half time for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and half time for Hunter and then the Washim Project came to an end and they paid me, I still get a little pension from them, which is</sentence><sentence id="5152">1 nice.</sentence><sentence id="5153">I belong to the Federal Employees Retirement Section, or whatever it is.</sentence><sentence id="5154">So, I've connections to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> no doubt!</sentence><sentence id="5155">I've been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hunter</span> from 1962, first five years were half time.</sentence><sentence id="5156">And I went there, I retired in 1970, my marriage dissolved in 1970, we separated for the new divorce and in 1974 he died.</sentence><sentence id="5157">He was younger than I, he got leukemia and he died.</sentence><sentence id="5158">And I retired from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hunter</span> in 1989, but I still teach the Holocaust course so I remain very much in, connected to the Holocaust course.</sentence><sentence id="5159">I started it on my sabbatical year because I was emotionally more ready to confront that material.</sentence><sentence id="5160">Until then, it was always with me, but I couldn't quite read.</sentence><sentence id="5161">I started digging into it and since then I cannot leave it, now and forever involved in it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5287">Q: What year was that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5289">A: This was, my sabbatical was 1978 and I started teaching in 1979 and I have been teaching it still since.</sentence><sentence id="5290">It's always been an important part of my life and since then I have been lecturing all over because it's the only school of social in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which offers it, which is unusual.</sentence><sentence id="5291">Yes, which is very unique, so I'm still with it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5295">Q: Were you unhappy to leave the case work that you were doing and go into <span class="BUILDING">teaching</span>?</sentence><sentence id="5296">Did you do it because your husband wanted you to do it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5299">A: By then I was not doing any, I didn't care, I was a supervisor.</sentence><sentence id="5300">I had a big job, I published, I wrote something on drug addition and I didn't want to leave because it was a very well paying job at that point and it was a prestigious job.</sentence><sentence id="5301">My husband wanted me to but this was not the major thing.</sentence><sentence id="5302">I was not a little woman ever in my life.</sentence><sentence id="5303">I think my parents sort of made me feel I'm okay and this really helped I think.</sentence><sentence id="5304">I've never succumbed this way, but my husband wanted it.</sentence><sentence id="5305">What was very nice was the prospect of long vacations.</sentence><sentence id="5306">We always traveled for ten years which was great.</sentence><sentence id="5307">But, no, there was always something in teaching that was prestigious.</sentence><sentence id="5308">I didn't think they would take me but they did and there were lots of times there too, all kinds of politics in the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> so I don't need to tell you about it, very often they want me out.</sentence><sentence id="5309">Eventually I made my way in and eventually I did well, but I had rough years there too.</sentence><sentence id="5310">The work was overwhelmingly big, a lot of work.</sentence><sentence id="5311">And there's so much competition there.</sentence><sentence id="5312">If you were on good terms with one, the other one was angry to you.</sentence><sentence id="5313">Not because of me but because of perhaps they didn't like the other person because politics of</sentence><sentence id="5315">2 the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> are something to write books about.</sentence><sentence id="5316">But basically, it's a decent <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it was a decent <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and of all the jobs I had there admissions work, you know, you do everything.</sentence><sentence id="5317">I had faculty advisement.</sentence><sentence id="5318">The favorite thing for me was always teaching.</sentence><sentence id="5319">I liked accompanying the students and this saved me always, always.</sentence><sentence id="5320">There were rough years too.</sentence><sentence id="5321">When I retired they did something awfully nice for me.</sentence><sentence id="5322">They established a collection of Holocaust literature in my name.</sentence><sentence id="5323">And it's there which is, and I wanted it in the name, I had a conflict of which name it should go, I wanted my parents too and I wanted my husband too.</sentence><sentence id="5324">So first we had it Maria Herr Schneider Rosenbloom, they said, but what became Maria Herr Rosenbloom.</sentence><sentence id="5325">And occasionally I lectured from it, books I bought, that is continuous sort of input which is great, couldn't be better.</sentence><sentence id="5326">My parents will be remembered this way, my family will be remembered this way, it's marvelous I think.</sentence><sentence id="5327">But since then I've always been in <span class="BUILDING">private practice</span> a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="5328">But always Holocaust related.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5360">Q: Private practice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5362">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="5363">Always Holocaust related, always.</sentence><sentence id="5364">The first time I work with Holocaust survivors was in a <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric</span>, I was working in <span class="BUILDING">psychiatry</span> because it was a natural thing for me.</sentence><sentence id="5365">I was trained in a way, so my first job was the <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric clinic</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Bathesda Hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5366">And there I was the only Yiddish speaking person, none of the psychiatrists spoke Yiddish, or wanted to speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="5367">So I was very much involved with every patient, nearly every patient.</sentence><sentence id="5368">Many of these people were considered refugees from Europe.</sentence><sentence id="5369">These were all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors.</sentence><sentence id="5370">Nobody knew the term.</sentence><sentence id="5371">I remember many, many fantastic situations from there.</sentence><sentence id="5372">One man refused shock treatment so they sent him to see me, see Miss Schneider.</sentence><sentence id="5373">Because I speak the same.</sentence><sentence id="5374">And in my stupidity I thought, why not?</sentence><sentence id="5375">He says his mother-in-law disapproves, I said, Pll talk to your mother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="5376">And his boss, he doesn't want his boss to know, so I say, okay, I can talk to him too.</sentence><sentence id="5377">I exhaust all of the possibilities and he says to me, to tell me the truth.</sentence><sentence id="5378">I don't want to make con-a-des-ot-rich (ph), shocking, no, electric shock treatment of me.</sentence><sentence id="5379">Some of these scenes were unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="5380">One woman, this I'll never forget.</sentence><sentence id="5381">She should be remembered somewhere as a result.</sentence><sentence id="5382">One woman, an from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span>, I didn't know her background very much, but she told me that she needed an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5383">They were in a horrible walk up and they so needed to, it was very</sentence><sentence id="5385">3 difficult, it was after the war, <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were not available.</sentence><sentence id="5386">So I did everything possible to move this family.</sentence><sentence id="5387">Finally, on <span class="DLF">Grant Street</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span>, projects came up.</sentence><sentence id="5388">Lower income projects and I got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for them in a new <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5389">With <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span>, with everything.</sentence><sentence id="5390">The day they move, to move, she runs into the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> desperate, insisting she must see me.</sentence><sentence id="5391">Crying, falling down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5392">I've never seen such, what happened?</sentence><sentence id="5393">She cannot live there, she moved in and she, I have to being her back to the old <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5394">She cannot live there and I don't understand what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="5395">This goes on for a while, that she cries, I must do something for her, she doesn't want to live there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="5396">She didn't say commit suicide, but she doesn't want to live anymore.</sentence><sentence id="5397">Finally, I still didn't understand, finally she says, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">incinerators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5398">I, that was a moment of awakening for me.</sentence><sentence id="5399">I didn't know about this revulsion, nobody talked about these things in those days.</sentence><sentence id="5400">She could not live with the reminder of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5401">She couldn't live with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">incinerators</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5402">So, this was a point of learning for me.</sentence><sentence id="5403">Then I started taking histories which included the history, until then, he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chop-kov</span> (ph) and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he went through the war, he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">war camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5404">That was the level of knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="5405">But since then, I've got a lot of experience.</sentence><sentence id="5406">For four years I worked in <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric clinic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5407">Gave me a lot of experience in working with survivors.</sentence><sentence id="5408">One woman left her child in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, she didn't want the child.</sentence><sentence id="5409">I went on a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> visit, she and her husband thought, she delivered there, they didn't want the child.</sentence><sentence id="5410">Who would defend such a thing?</sentence><sentence id="5411">And then I heard them speak.</sentence><sentence id="5412">She was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and she saw some horrible fate of children.</sentence><sentence id="5413">And he was so identified with her that he literally repeated all her words and all her ideas, he assumed all her ideations.</sentence><sentence id="5414">In those days we had a term for it, a-folly-adert (ph), he thought exactly like his wife.</sentence><sentence id="5415">So these were things none of the doctors understood any of it because it was a non-subject.</sentence><sentence id="5416">The Holocaust was a non-subject truly until Ish-metz (ph) story came through.</sentence><sentence id="5417">I was very lucky to have this experience and I always stayed with it in a way.</sentence><sentence id="5418">I started attending meetings.</sentence><sentence id="5419">There was some, what was his name?</sentence><sentence id="5420">A psychiatrist, Christal (ph) and Freidel- lander (ph), they began to talk about it.</sentence><sentence id="5421">And then when I established a course I became very much devoted.</sentence><sentence id="5422">But I've always had patients of this background, very few, but always to see some people with this kind of background.</sentence><sentence id="5423">I still see one, what do you call it?</sentence><sentence id="5424">Load-man-ish (ph), doesn't really</sentence><sentence id="5426">4 matter really, you know, but I've always kept a foot in the <span class="DLF">door</span> with this so I've been always into it.</sentence><sentence id="5427">It helps in my teaching.</sentence><sentence id="5428">I need to bring the past experience, the <span class="BUILDING">survivor agencies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5429">I never left the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5430">It's strange, but somehow or other, it became a central part of my life.</sentence><sentence id="5431">I am sure the central part of every survivor's life, but "m more aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="5432">You never leave the Holocaust behind really.</sentence><sentence id="5433">Those you see or those you don't see.</sentence><sentence id="5434">Those who talk and those who don't talk.</sentence><sentence id="5435">It is the same coin, it's just the reverse side.</sentence><sentence id="5436">But if they don't want to talk or whether they talk obsessently about it, it's the same.</sentence><sentence id="5437">You don't exorcise it, it is with you.</sentence><sentence id="5438">Some remember, some don't want to remember.</sentence><sentence id="5439">You don't want to remember because it's so central to your
