that was a regular ritual with them, in the morning to go in we got a beating and then when we left we got a beating.</sentence><sentence id="760">Either way we didn't walk fast enough

to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and we'd always get beatings over there.</sentence><sentence id="761">And then, you know, once we got up to the -- inside the factory compound, we all knew where our <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> were.</sentence><sentence id="762">And the new ones were assigned to the <span class="REGION">areas</span> wherever they assigned them

that.</sentence><sentence id="774">That's -- I lost one sister right there.</sentence><sentence id="775">Of course, the others, in the beginning when we had -- when the -- what do you call it, the -- when they took everybody, the old and the young away, in the beginning I lost a sister there, too, in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="776">But that's how I lost one of them.</sentence><sentence id="777">The other sister, my t -- the -- the one that was two years older than I was, she came down with typhus.</sentence><sentence id="778">And they had, believe it or not, so to speak, a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="779">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span>, on one side, one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk bed</span> on the other side.</sentence><sentence id="780">No blanket, no nothing to cover yourself with, just plain old wood.</sentence><sentence id="781">And I still til today don't know why they didn't kill her and why they let her stay in that little <span

see how she is.</sentence><sentence id="783">And one morning I came in, she was no longer there.</sentence><sentence id="784">So I went up to the Jewish policeman which I knew, and I said -- his name was Muttle, Muttle Hilf.</sentence><sentence id="785">I said -- I ran into him and I said, Muttle, what</sentence><sentence id="787">Interview with Henry Greenbaum *deg December 20, 1999 happened to my sister?</sentence><sentence id="788">He said, she died during the night and we already buried her in the bottom of the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> [indecipherable] a <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span>, and we buried her there, but the two -- one that was two years older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="789">So I was only left with one more sister in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Faige</span>.</sentence><sentence id="790">And I lost her too, as we going to come into it.</sentence><sentence id="791">We stayed there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, then we -- the -- the Russians advanced a little bit from the east coming in, and then we could hear the artillery pounding already and we knew something was going on.</sentence><sentence id="792">So my sister Faige and this Jewish policeman got together, and there was another Jewish policeman who -- his name was Moishe Herblum, he was sort of related to us, a distant cousin.</sentence><sentence id="793">She and him got hooked up to work out some way that we going to try to escape from that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the shift -- that -- that shift I had from three to 11 that e -- in the night.</sentence><sentence id="795">Came <span class="BUILDING">home 11</span>, she looked me up, my sister and she says, we're going to escape tonight, don't tell anybody, no one.</sentence><sentence id="796">I said, okay.</sentence><sentence id="797">So she -- I said, when am I going to know when to run?</sentence><sentence id="798">She says, I'll come and get you.</sentence><sentence id="799">So she says, just be ready, stay in front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> in -- of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I'll come and get you.</sentence><sentence id="800">She and the policeman came along and got me.</sentence><sentence id="801">By that time other people knew it already too, because I saw a lot of commotion, people were running.</sentence><sentence id="802">And somebody got into the -- to the barbed wire and cut through the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">And as we were running, the ike -- the cue was if the lights are off, we run.</sentence><sentence id="804">So the lights were off.</sentence><sentence id="805">So</sentence><sentence id="807">Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 the people what their mission was to cut the <span class="DLF">wires</span>, they did the job.</sentence><sentence id="808">And a lot of people was -- tried to fight through that little <span class="REGION">area</span> to get out, and they got entangled to one another, and a lot of commotion.</sentence><sentence id="809">By that time the guard heard a lot of -- more noise going on, so he took the lights and put the searchlight towards that <span class="REGION">area</span> where he heard the noise and he saw people were running out.</sentence><sentence id="810">He opened fire and I was running with my sister and the Jewish policeman together, and I got hit in the head, wounded, and I dropped.</sentence><sentence id="811">My sister, after I dropped I don't know what happened to her, o-or to the policeman.</sentence><sentence id="812">I know people were running back, the lights went on and people were running in every direction, in, out, in and out.</sentence><sentence id="813">Somebody jumped on me with a [indecipherable] and put a scar on here, I was bleeding from here, I was bleeding from my head until I -- they were stampeding me.</sentence><sentence id="814">So I finally woke up and came -- a few seconds, I came up to myself, I said -- I started screaming for my sister, Faige, Faige, and I didn't hear from her.</sentence><sentence id="815">So I said to myself, why don't I go into he -- the <span class="BUILDING">women's barrack</span> and look for her.</sentence><sentence id="816">So, I was a little bit disor-oriented, I didn't know which -- I lost a lot of blood, and I did manage to go into the <span class="BUILDING">women's barrack</span>, which she shouldn't have gone in, but I took a chance, I went in there.</sentence><sentence id="817">The -- the lady in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was one of our Jewish women from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so I knew her, sort of.</sentence><sentence id="818">So I figured she's not going to bother me too much.</sentence><sentence id="819">I went, Faige, Faige in th -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, no Faige.</sentence><sentence id="820">So my -- my first cousin,</sentence><sentence id="822">Interview with Henry Greenbaum % December 20, 1999 Ida, she was my first cousin, she says, what are you sh -- she says, what are you looking for?</sentence><sentence id="823">I was looking for Faige, have you seen Faige?</sentence><sentence id="824">She says no, she's not here.</sentence><sentence id="825">And then she saw I was bleeding [indecipherable] from my head, so she grabbed that shirt, dipped it in some water [indecipherable] I put it on my head, tried to stop the bleeding, and -- and I couldn't leave that <span class="BUILDING">women's barracks</span> that night, I had to stay overnight there, underneath th-the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, I squeezed myself underneath there.</sentence><sentence id="826">And she told me to hold this over my head, which I did.</sentence><sentence id="827">And then -- because all night long they were -- they were angry that we were trying to escape, so they were shooting all night long into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> with the -- with the rifles, boom, boom -- with the machine guns, boom, boom, boom, boom, all night long, until early in the morning it stopped, I snuck out of there and went into -- back to my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="828">And three days later the rumor was sure, that we are going to be shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="829">My sister didn't tell me that, but that's the reason they wanted to escape, because we going to be shipped out.</sentence><sentence id="830">And one to the other was talking, they said here we helping, actually, the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="831">Everybody has a job, we work in the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span>, and all kind of <span class="BUILDING">copper foundries</span>, each one had a job.</sentence><sentence id="832">We were actually helping the Germans, and if they ship us out of here, where can they take us?</sentence><sentence id="833">To probably [indecipherable] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="834">We didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="835">So my sister was trying to escape with me and the policeman.</sentence><sentence id="836">Now, the rumor later was</sentence><sentence id="838">Interview with Henry Greenbaum %8 December 20, 1999 around, saying that the underground was supposed to have met us there.</sentence><sentence id="839">There was - - the way they worked it out, they wouldn't tell me anything about it, they didn't want me to know, in case I get caught or something, so I don't have nothing to tell them.</sentence><sentence id="840">It was all arra -- arranged with the partisans, who were supposed to meet that -- at 11 - 12 o'clock in the night, and to eliminate the guard and knock the lights out.</sentence><sentence id="841">And it so happened there was an air raid, so the lights went off anyway, and there was -- got a little bit mixed up.</sentence><sentence id="842">It so happened that the -- the partisans never showed.</sentence><sentence id="843">Maybe they got some problems, they never showed.</sentence><sentence id="844">So we proceeded with our stuff that we said we going to do, we did.</sentence><sentence id="845">So, a lo -- some of them did escape, I don't know how many, so the next morning roll call they wanted to see how many escaped, so they chased everybody out from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they would start to count the names and the -- and they marched us over to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where -- where we were trying to escape, we cut through the <span class="DLF">wires</span>.</sentence><sentence id="846">And right in the front of us there was the policeman, wounded.</sentence><sentence id="847">My sister was there, but she was dead.</sentence><sentence id="848">But there was about, I would say 10 - 15 people laying there, moaning and moaning and groaning, blood -- lot of blood flowing around and -- and they made us look and they took the machine gun and killed every one of them.</sentence><sentence id="849">And they said this is the lesson that you will learn.</sentence><sentence id="850">If you escape, that's what will happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="851">So from now on, stay put,</sentence><sentence id="853">Interview with Henry Greenbaum * December 20, 1999 don't -- don't escape any more.</sentence><sentence id="854">And this is the lesson that we learned right there.</sentence><sentence id="855">And sure enough, within about four or five days later we were shipped out of there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
