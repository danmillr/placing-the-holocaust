and on May the 10th the war broke out in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">The Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on May the 10th, and the war was only five days.</sentence><sentence id="72">I had two brothers what were in the, in the army.</sentence><sentence id="73">And it was a very nervous atmosphere, because we had a lot of Jewish people in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> because a Friday -- from Friday or Saturday the war started and they stayed--there were a lot of Jewish people would stay overnight--and they stayed in our <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, and everybody was tremendously -- was panicky.</sentence><sentence id="74">Very panicky right away, and because they know what was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> happened.</sentence><sentence id="75">It was next to the, the <span class="DLF">border</span> was next to where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="76">You know, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is very small.</sentence><sentence id="77">And so, they, they, they run away and some--we have a lot of water in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> -- the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ijssel</span> was a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and they left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">They drove them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, and they went farther together; because they thought that the German cannot take it.</sentence><sentence id="79">So it was a big panic.</sentence><sentence id="80">And after five days -- well, there was a lot of traitors in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> so the war didn't took long in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">After five days the war was over.</sentence><sentence id="82">And they didn't start right away, the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="83">They did it very slowly on; because they know that they cannot do it like it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, right away, and in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> perhaps.</sentence><sentence id="84">But they did it very slowly on, and very often -- very -- they did it in a way that no -- nobody felt really that there was something going on and it would happen something, serious things.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: What happened, with the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, or what did you begin to notice?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: In 1941, there was a club in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, and it was a men's club.</sentence><sentence id="120">Very sophisticated, for lawyers; and, and the German right away took that <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="121">So one of the head of the police and the owner from that <span class="BUILDING">men's club</span> came to my mother and say, you know, "Why don't you go out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>, so the Germans don't take it.</sentence><sentence id="122">And we take your <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and that you will save."</sentence><sentence id="123">And my mother was very upset, of course.</sentence><sentence id="124">They really-- my father died, what I told you -- they really built that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> by themselves, really built it.</sentence><sentence id="125">And to leave everything, just to go out what you have in your hand, was very hard.</sentence><sentence id="126">So I don't remember exactly what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="127">I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother had to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and could just take with her--they talked her into it, perhaps it was the best-they could just go out of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">And there was another Jewish family in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> what, had a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, very poor little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a very poor <span class="REGION">area</span>, and, we moved in that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in.</sentence><sentence id="129">But I have to tell -- yeah -- it was already -- we moved into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in and in that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in, and, and it was horrible.</sentence><sentence id="130">There was no hot water and there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and it was a very poor <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and I really hated it, | remember; and it was a very difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already walking through your <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">And also one day the German took all the people what went over to another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over to the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews what went over to the Catholic religion.</sentence><sentence id="132">So they didn't know -- they picked my mother and my two brothers and me.</sentence><sentence id="133">My oldest brother was married.</sentence><sentence id="134">I, 1 come from a family from four children and I was the youngest.</sentence><sentence id="135">I had three older brothers.</sentence><sentence id="136">And they took us already to the <span class="DLF">German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was a Jewish Raad", a Jewish group of people.</sentence><sentence id="138">What they say they help the Jews going to, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but they went after it and they know that they made a mistake and we were already one or two days.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Okay, fine.</sentence><sentence id="160">Can you just go back and explain why were you taken?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="163">A: Because that was a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="164">It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that the, the Wynberg, that boy, that he was it.</sentence><sentence id="165">They thought that we were it.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="167">And it -- because we had the same name.</sentence><sentence id="168">And so they sent us already -- and always we had a little backpack staying by the <span class="DLF">door</span> because everybody knows already that it would be perhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enschede</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="169">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Enschede</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">It was on the <span class="DLF">German border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">And when we were there the Dutch Jewish organization, the Jewish Raad was there -- I don't know how it is in English.</sentence><sentence id="172">They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwolle</span>, where I lived.</sentence><sentence id="173">And I remember when we came back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: And how did they get you back?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="187">A: I don't know, exactly.</sentence><sentence id="188">They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the wrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy what he went over to the Catholic religion and not we.</sentence><sentence id="189">We were Jews, and, and that's the reason, they got us back.</sentence><sentence id="190">They went after that they said they had the wrong people.</sentence><sentence id="191">But that was just a postponing of a time.</sentence><sentence id="192">And so we went -- I remember we came back and all the * Council (Dutch) people were standing on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and, and everybody came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and congratulated us.</sentence><sentence id="193">That's the reason it's so in my memory, that thing, that way.</sentence><sentence id="194">But, it didn't help much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="204">Q: What happened when you did go back?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="207">We just--</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: What was your life like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="212">A: Our life was -- we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting.</sentence><sentence id="213">It was very strenuous and it was very nervous.</sentence><sentence id="214">And, and the men had to go already to, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> but I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so.</sentence><sentence id="215">And, the men had to go to work <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">And I remember my brother was -- one of my brothers was hidden and he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="217">And they starting already talking; they say, "Oh, when somebody goes to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>, then my father will be sent away.</sentence><sentence id="218">So you better come out of the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="219">So my brother came out of the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and her father -- they would have sent away anyway -- my -- you know, the rumors go around.</sentence><sentence id="220">You didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="221">And so my brother came out.</sentence><sentence id="222">And the men went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span>, but they were allowed to go weekends <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; so nobody saw something difficult in it, not so serious in it.</sentence><sentence id="223">They thought, "Oh, they have to go there for helping, doing things," and they came weekends <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">So in between, also, there were things going on in, in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">That a young group of men didn't have anything to do.</sentence><sentence id="226">They're all -- everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and they put Volk-, traitors what went with the Germans-they put in these <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">So the men didn't have anything to do.</sentence><sentence id="228">And we were not allowed to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after five o'clock at night; we have to stay in.</sentence><sentence id="229">So these men, eight young married men, came together and played card.</sentence><sentence id="230">And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, "You know, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card."</sentence><sentence id="231">And they took these eight men and sent them to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">So that was going on a lot.</sentence><sentence id="233">It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people, what were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say anything.</sentence><sentence id="234">I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Apeldoorn</span> and helped--and that's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>--and helped an older family, an older couple.</sentence><sentence id="235">But it was after a very short time also very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="236">And there was not much what you could do.</sentence><sentence id="237">I remember one day I was walked in my <span class="DLF">street</span>, and in the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I was, was a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there was a Catholic priest lived in there.</sentence><sentence id="238">And the Catholic priest came to me and he say -- he start talking to me, and he said, "How do you think that you can save your life?"</sentence><sentence id="239">And I say, "The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when not-Jewish people take us in."</sentence><sentence id="240">And, the same evening he came to me and he say, "I have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for you.</sentence><sentence id="241">I have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for you where you can go.</sentence><sentence id="242">And be ready tomorrow morning at five o'clock, six o'clock," I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning, "with your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, and a little bit what you can take with you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, and I will bring you there."</sentence><sentence id="243">And that what I did.</sentence><sentence id="244">I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers, and I never saw them again.</sentence><sentence id="245">That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family.</sentence><sentence id="246">And, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span>, and I went to, a family -- no, a woman, what she was a nurse.</sentence><sentence id="247">She came also from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">I went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and, I stayed with her a few months.</sentence><sentence id="249">And that was very, a very nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> with this woman to live; what she was the whole day gone and I was the whole day alone.</sentence><sentence id="250">And, then she had another family what she want to take in, and I went to another <span class="BUILDING">family's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">A very large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with, a lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I was there the maid.</sentence><sentence id="252">I had to clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="253">I was not allowed to go open the <span class="DLF">door</span> ever.</sentence><sentence id="254">I was not allowed to go out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>; and there was no food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very hard already, food in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> -- they suffered tremendous in the war.</sentence><sentence id="256">They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have much, it was very difficult; and these people, they really didn't have anything in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">I remember they cooked the bones ten times to make soup and they had the cat's plate already with it.</sentence><sentence id="258">It was very awful fam-- it was a very awful time for me to be there alone.</sentence><sentence id="259">And, I, I didn't I didn't get much to eat there.</sentence><sentence id="260">I remember I stole sometimes an apple, or I put in a sandwich under my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> that at night when I came to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that I had something to eat-- because there was, really nothing to eat there.</sentence><sentence id="261">These people -- when I was there a few months, they had another Jewish family and they took in; an professor it was there--I met his wife, and they came upstairs and they want to use me also as a maid.</sentence><sentence id="262">I didn't let it.</sentence><sentence id="263">They had, they wanted I cleaned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and things like that, and I didn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="264">Because I was so very lonely and so unhappy, one day they told me that not far from them is another Jewish family hidden;
