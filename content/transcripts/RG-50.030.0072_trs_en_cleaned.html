oh I have got some as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="25">I uh remember being very very angry at my father, uh and I gather the story is sort of funny.</sentence><sentence id="26">When I was two, my uh father had decided that I was - oh I was one and a half - my father decided that it was time for me to sit on the pot by myself, and I was, I gather, pretty stubborn, and my mother used to hold me up and he decided I was old enough to sit by myself, and he, so he said, he told me to sit down and I refused, I gather.</sentence><sentence id="27">Now I don't remember that, and according to the story, he pushed me down and I screamed bloody murder and he walked out - and these are all, this was all reported, and my mother cried and I cried.</sentence><sentence id="28">Well, what I do remember is that I was so angry at him that when he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on Fridays - he traveled - he uh was a representative for a clothing firm - I remember it and I must have been only two years old - hearing the key in the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I remember even sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and exactly what I sat, and as soon as | heard the key in the <span class="DLF">door</span> I would take my plate and I would walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and I would go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and eat with our uh our uh our maid, and I just refused I gather, I refused to talk to him for months and I I have a lot of you know respect for that little two-year old with such strong principles.</sentence><sentence id="29">Uh and then I remember uh going with my mother to visit my aunt and uncle and my cousin was exactly my age in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Assen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">And they owned a <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> there and I was spending a couple of weeks with them and getting to know her which is still a memory on my part because they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and of</sentence><sentence id="32">course never came back and coming back and and reconciling with my father.</sentence><sentence id="33">I I decided to forgive him after all that time and I talked to him about that and and he said, I said how did you cope with that.</sentence><sentence id="34">how did you cope with this two year old just refusing to talk to you?</sentence><sentence id="35">He said, that was your choice and I respected your choice, and that's the kind of man that he is.</sentence><sentence id="36">Uh, you know, I think he was later on very sorry he had done it but in those days that's that was appropriate discipline.</sentence><sentence id="37">I remember that I was, interestingly enough, I was my father's favorite.</sentence><sentence id="38">I was a very bright child.</sentence><sentence id="39">Uh I was very eager to learn.</sentence><sentence id="40">I have a brother who is three years older than I am and my brother got into trouble early in the game uh in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, like he was accused of stealing some stealing some crayons when he was in first grade, so I must have been three.</sentence><sentence id="41">And the teacher called my father and I remember uh, oh my father just being furious at my brother and giving him spanking and sort of feeling, my feeling very sorry for him, and sort of you know wondering how he could be quote, a bad boy.</sentence><sentence id="42">Uh we lived in a in a we lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="43">My grandparents lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="44">Uh I don't remember my grandmother very much.</sentence><sentence id="45">She died in "39, but my mother is German and my father had, as soon as Hitler came to power as a matter of fact in 1933 or "34, my father got my mother's parents out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">They lived with us in in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so uh it was my parents, my grandparents and then four children.</sentence><sentence id="47">My youngest sister was, my younger sister was born in 1938 and then I had another sister born who was born in 1940 but she died in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="48">And I remember her being born.</sentence><sentence id="49">She was born just before the war, in 1940, and she was born in January and thinking that that's my baby.</sentence><sentence id="50">That was my little baby sister -

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="99">Q: Were there other Jews in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you lived in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Oh yeah.</sentence><sentence id="102">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="103">The the photographer as a matter of fact uh, Alter was his name, were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="104"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> I think uh before the war had about 110,000 Jews.</sentence><sentence id="105">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we lived in, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span>, didn't, had over 200.</sentence><sentence id="106">It didn't have a large Jewish community, but it had a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, an <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span> and my, as a matter of fact I remember my father and my my uh grandfather going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh and I remember on Friday night they had services, Friday night, and we had our dinner and the candles on Friday night and uh it was it was a pretty tight Jewish community.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: And you family was a part of that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: Oh very much part of that.</sentence><sentence id="116">My parents were both raised in <span class="BUILDING">orthodox Jewish homes</span>, my</sentence><sentence id="118">mother in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my father in in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, but uh my father rebelled very early uh against orthodox Judaism so altho...although I'm not quite sure - we kept the kosh..., my parents kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> but I'm not sure whether it was mostly for their uh sake as it was for my grandfather's sake who was raised and had lived all his live in an orthodox family.</sentence><sentence id="119">But definitely part, strong part of the Jewish community.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: Uh do you have any recollections of the beginning of the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="130">I do.</sentence><sentence id="131">Uh I was four and the the the strongest recollection is when the Germans invaded because what happened was that we were told that they were going to bomb <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> and so all of us, and that was Jews, non-Jews, uh were told to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> and my brother was hospitalized - he had a middle ear infection - and my mother was frantic because we were all told to leave.</sentence><sentence id="132">My mother was absolutely frantic, was trying to get him into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they were told that they had to keep the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> empty for the wounded that were expected, so all of us, uh all of us including my baby sister and my aunt - at that point my aunt, my mother's only sister and her daughter also lived with us, so it was a hugh family.</sentence><sentence id="133">My my grandfather who was oh 80 years, uh five small children - by that time my baby sister was born - five small children, uh the oldest of whom was seven, my parents, my aunt and her daughter, all had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="134">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="135">We were, we had to walk - we walked about I would say between twenty and thirty kilometers along a <span class="DLF">road</span> uh trying to find <span class="DLF">farms</span> where we could stay and I remember being strafed --the bombs, the Germans would bomb us.</sentence><sentence id="136">And uh there were seventy people killed just along that <span class="DLF">road</span> and I remember uh a woman still standing over her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span>, protecting her baby who was killed.</sentence><sentence id="137">And every time the the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> would come, my aunt, my mother's sister, would pull us aside and and she was particularly fond of me and she'd literally cover me with her body.</sentence><sentence id="138">And then when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> left then we'd walk again, and I remember stopping at <span class="DLF">farms</span> and the <span class="DLF">farms</span> would be full and finally - I think it was about 28 kilometers - we had walked 28 kilometers - uh getting to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> where they had some <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we spent about five days there, sleeping in the hay, until the all-clear was sounded and then walking back - the having to walk back we were not strafed - I don't remember being strafed or bombed during that walk back.</sentence><sentence id="139">Uh and half way through some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> came and so mothers with children were allowed to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and so we didn't we didn't have to walk all the way back.</sentence><sentence id="140">And coming back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and founding, finding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> unscathed basically - so that was the first memory of the war.</sentence><sentence id="141">Uh then ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="155">Q: When you returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, was it already occupied by the Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="158">You see at that point the Germans - they they overrun, they overran <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in five days, so I mean the the Dutch put up a strong resistance but you know, they were not prepared to deal with the masses and then of course the Germans bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> as punishment for German, for Dutch resistance.</sentence><sentence id="159">And uh so we were immediately occupied by the Germans and nothing much happened immediately but then my memories of those early years are pretty vague because they they started rounding up Jews - oh first from the <span class="DLF">coast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> is 50 kilometers north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and 50 kilometers southeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="162">I gather they picked up Jews initially from the <span class="DLF">coastlines</span>, so to prevent them from fleeing.</sentence><sentence id="163">That's why I think there were so many Dutch were murd... were massacred - they they just had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="164">They couldn't leave.</sentence><sentence id="165"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> was immediately occupied and all <span class="DLF">exits</span> were basically uh closed and so you were trapped in, we were trapped in our own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And the first memories I have uh I have is of wearing a yellow, having to wear a yellow star and I was four, so I wasn't ready for <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet, but uh I remember that because we wore a yellow star, we weren't allowed to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="167">I remember we weren't allowed to have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radios</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">Uh and then we were told that when I was ready to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1942, well really it was 1941, uh we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore and so for a while there was a little <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> that they had in a - I remember it was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of a of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> down town Breda, and going there and sitting in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> with who knows - twenty other Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="169">And the children just disappearing.</sentence><sentence id="170">I mean one after the other these children just disappeared until that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed and then my father tried to teach us at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I think that was in 1942 because Jewish children were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="171">And and then you know, getting strong messages that that something very bad was going to happen and it was scary and my parents being scared and just fear, fear enveloping the family pretty much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="189">Q: When you mentioned the children disappearing from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, were were families at that point being deported?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="192">That's when they started.</sentence><sentence id="193">They started deporting the Dutch Jews, as I said they uh they started first deporting them from the <span class="DLF">coasts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">They didn't - the reason we we survived is because they didn't get to us until 1942 uh so we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> until 19...until the fall of 1942 uh but had they come had they come to us earlier we would have we would have disappeared too.</sentence><sentence id="195">Uh see I have a memory still and this this was how close that it was.</sentence><sentence id="196">My aunt lived in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we did but in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of it, and they picked her up oh I think a couple of months before they came to us, and I can remember, I mean I have a clear memory of standing in our <span class="DLF">doorway</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in and waving goodbye to her and her daughter, and they were off to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish war camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">That's what I was told.</sentence><sentence id="198">And they went with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> where they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and of course never came back.</sentence><sentence id="199">And that was the aunt who was very very close to me, my mother's only sister and her daughter.</sentence><sentence id="200">So uh, so they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> uh where we would have gone too uh but - oh yeah, because we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> so we were just far enough from the <span class="DLF">border</span> that we were to be picked up later.</sentence><sentence id="201">And uh it just, and these children you know, may have lived on the on the outlying areas of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span>, the children, and then of course the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> closed because there were no children really left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: During this period of the of the occupation, uh how did your parents tell you how to behave when you left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: Uh, to be very very careful.</sentence><sentence id="216">I mean we wore yellow stars and and the yellow...the way it worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is that everybody had to have an ausweiss.</sentence><sentence id="217">That was like a passport, and - including us children - and uh in order for us in order for one to have rationing cards you had</sentence><sentence id="219">to have an ausweiss, and Jews had a big J on their ausweiss.</sentence><sentence id="220">And, of course, we had to wear the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="221">So you could be stopped at any time and asked for your ausweiss, and if you if you didn't have your ausweiss with you or and you wore a yellow star, you were shot almost you were shot immediately.</sentence><sentence id="222">So what basically happened is we, they didn't let us uh - we were young anyway - but they didn't, they they became extremely protective of us and they didn't let us be out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> by ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="223">And when we would go out, it was with my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="224">My grandmother had died in "39 but my grandfather would take us for walks.</sentence><sentence id="225">As a matter of fact that's one of the reasons we were saved.</sentence><sentence id="226">It's just incredible, incredible uh circumstance.</sentence><sentence id="227">When I ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: Shoot.</sentence><sentence id="244">Why don't you go ahead and talk about that.</sentence><sentence id="245">We can go back.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="250">The uh uh so that that - what happened was that life became totally family-oriented, that uh they first picked up the Jewish men and I - that's another extraordinary situation - that my my mother's father uh had been very very wealthy, and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zempelburg</span> [Pol: S_polno, or S_pdlno Krai_skie] in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">And after the Ist World War, during the 1st World War, had contributed a lot of money to the German war effort, and after World War I when that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where he lived uh became Polish, and he opted to remain German and he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and he got a Cross of Merit from the German Kaiser.</sentence><sentence id="252">Uh they picked up Dutch men first.</sentence><sentence id="253">They took them, Jewish men first and they took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> and my father had sort of been excused a couple of times one because he was head of the Jewish Council, or he was not perhaps not head but he was a member of the Jewish Council, because he had five children, uh and so on, but he had to, he was to report and I can remember it - my mother just being in tears.</sentence><sentence id="254">Well, the day before, the day before my father was to report, my mother, and she is an incredible woman really - she took that Cross of Merit to the Nazi commander of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and everybody said don't be ridiculous - it's not going to do you any good, and she said look at what my father did for you know the <span class="REGION">fatherland</span>, and he actually acc...he actually excused my father, thanks to her.</sentence><sentence id="255">And again, that saved our lives because without my father we would not have been saved.</sentence><sentence id="256">And the next week, it turned out that was about a week before the rest of the family was going to be called out - we disappeared within that week.</sentence><sentence id="257">And the reason we survived is because a man who worked for <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span>, uh and I don't know - this this is what I was told - I mean that's not a memory I have.</sentence><sentence id="258">I remember walking with my with my grandfather of course, but what happened uh he would take us for walks and a man who worked for <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> knew what was knew what was happening to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="259">By 1942 by the way everybody knew what was happening to Jews, so the the idea that people didn't know and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> didn't know, and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> didn't know is garbage.</sentence><sentence id="260">Because we knew and we had no radio.</sentence><sentence id="261">And everybody knew.</sentence><sentence id="262">Uh and uh this man had seen us because he worked for <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">He was familiar with what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="264">He had seen my father take us four children for a walk.</sentence><sentence id="265">My baby sister was too little.</sentence><sentence id="266">And he felt so sorry for us because he knew what was going to happen to us, that one day he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, he came to my father's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he basically said do you want to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="267">My father said no.</sentence><sentence id="268">He said well, why don't you do something about it.</sentence><sentence id="269">My father said what can I do - I've got five small children and an elderly father-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="270">And he said if I, if I promise to help you, will you try and get out, and within a week - and I</sentence><sentence id="272">remember a significant part of that - uh other friends, Dutch friends had given us names of people who were willing to take in Jewish children, and within a week we disappeared, and it turned out to be just in time, just before the whole family would have been deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, because most Jews went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">Uh and what he did is he gave us false passports so the false ausweiss, so as our name was in Dutch "Magnus," uh he gave us authentic passports--because he had access to the blanks--and with new names.</sentence><sentence id="274">And our new name became "Wachness."</sentence><sentence id="275">Of course, Magnus is spelled M - A - G- N- U-S. Wachness was spelled - it sounds the same.</sentence><sentence id="276">So if we would make a mistake, it wouldn't be as noticeable.</sentence><sentence id="277">But the spelling was totally different - it was W- A- C- H-N-E-S-S. And uh and I remember one day we were playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and my mother calling us in and saying, children, we want you all to pick a new name.</sentence><sentence id="278">And we had, because Anita is not a common Dutch name - uh we had always pretended we had different names, and I still feel bad about this because my sister Ingrid, the young...one just below me, her her play name had been Leesha (ph), but that's the one I had coveted, and mine had been Lanie (ph) and so when we got to pick new names, I said I want to be Leesha, and I remember Ingrid saying that's my name and I said well I got to be first again.</sentence><sentence id="279">You know, I was the older girl so I got to pick so that's how we picked the new name.</sentence><sentence id="280">My brother's name was Norman.</sentence><sentence id="281">He became Jan. I became Leesha.</sentence><sentence id="282">My sister Ingrid became Lenie (ph) and my other sister Helga became Hennie.</sentence><sentence id="283">And so we got to pick new names and that's that seemed like a big lark to us and then we were called <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and in the meantime my parents had gotten names of people who were willing to take us - we were called <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and we were told that we were all going to go away.</sentence><sentence id="284">And that we were going to go to strange people, and uh my parents didn't know who they were, but that if we didn't go we would not...we would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="285">And that we were never ever to tell anybody that we were Jewish because that would mean that we would die.</sentence><sentence id="286">And that we would have our new names, we would live with these people, and that the story that they made up was - it's still a peculiar story that we had, we were Dutch but we had lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Emden</span>, which is near...it's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> near the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span>, <span class="REGION">northwestern Germany</span>, and that when the war broke out we decided we wanted to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> - we didn't want to be, so we basically were refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my grandfather who's who's German, that he was Swiss - uh and uh and because we were refugees we couldn't live with our parents because my parents, our parents were looking for jobs someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="287">And that's why we were, that's why we had to be you know with strange people.</sentence><sentence id="288">That was the story that we were to tell people who would ask us uh you know why we weren't living with our parents.</sentence><sentence id="289">Immediately after that my brother and I were taken away and taken to a family in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> we lived in, and we stayed there for two weeks and uh was, they lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that - and again in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because it's so such a crowded <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, several families would live in the in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there were another family living on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">The family on the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> did not know that we were on the second floor.</sentence><sentence id="291">So for two weeks we could not move.</sentence><sentence id="292">I remember we slept in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">We could not talk.</sentence><sentence id="294">We could not move.</sentence><sentence id="295">We couldn't do anything because we were told that if they, the people downstairs would find out that we were upstairs we'd be killed.</sentence><sentence id="296">And we, I remember also that sometimes they would take us out twelve o'clock at night just to give us some fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="297">So we'd we'd go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and that was that was a very hard time because in the mean...you know, we had no idea where our parents</sentence><sentence id="299">were.</sentence><sentence id="300">I mean there is a six-year old and a nine-year old just taken away, totally, from parents, sisters, and everything else and and, and yet we knew - you know, there was no crying.</sentence><sentence id="301">There was no whining.</sentence><sentence id="302">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="303">There was just obedience.</sentence><sentence id="304">And then after two weeks we were taken by some other people to the middle of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and we stayed for two years with a magnificent family called the Buchas (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilthoven</span>--uh, which is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span>, which is in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="305">And they ran a very progressive <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the "<span class="DLF">Werkplatz</span> (ph)," the "<span class="BUILDING">work place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="306">She was a daughter of the Cadbury family of the British chocolates Cadbury family.</sentence><sentence id="307">And they were Quakers; and because they ran a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, they took in other children who were not Jewish and so for them to have other children there was not as obvious as it would have been for you know for an ordinary family.</sentence><sentence id="308">So that was a very safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to be.</sentence><sentence id="309">Now we were told never ever ever to tell anybody we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="310">That nobody knew and that we were never to let it be known, and so that was a horrendous burden on us.</sentence><sentence id="311">On me particularly and it's interesting that when my brother's much older, well three years older than I am, I think I was much more conscious of the whole situation than he was and uh and my earliest memory - I think when we we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilthoven</span> in in October - no in September of 1942, and again what surprises me in retrospect is that there was no questioning - it was it was real acceptance and real understanding of what was going to happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="312">There was no question about the fact that if we were discovered we would be killed.</sentence><sentence id="313">I mean that, we lived with that throughout the war, and I also - you know, now when I think about the horror of it, it blows me away.</sentence><sentence id="314">But I'm so grateful we were children because we accepted it - there was none of the the fear of the neurosis, or the neurosis or anything else.</sentence><sentence id="315">There was none of the pathology that that could have induced really uh because we just knew it was going to happen - that that was the way, you know, being very concrete still uh we just accepted that's the way it was and it was scary.</sentence><sentence id="316">Uh my father came to visit us in October; so after months, my father appeared.</sentence><sentence id="317">And it turned out he and my mother and my grandfather had gone to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span>, which is in the southeastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">We tried to go <span class="NPIP">places</span> where nobody knew us.</sentence><sentence id="319">My two younger sisters came about a month later and uh they had gone with my parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span> but that was too dangerous, so they they leaved them with another teacher of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that my brother and I were.</sentence><sentence id="320">And my baby sitter...sist...uh sister Rita went to which is in the western part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>; though she died of diphtheria in 1943, so I never never saw her again.</sentence><sentence id="321">Uh but my father came in October; and I'll remember his visit and it was incredible to see him.</sentence><sentence id="322">And he told us that uh he told us that uh our birthdays have been changed.</sentence><sentence id="323">That my brother, whose birthday was November 10th, was his new birthday was January 3rd.</sentence><sentence id="324">And my birthday, which is January 29th, was going to be January 21.</sentence><sentence id="325">And we accepted all that.</sentence><sentence id="326">You know, again, you didn't question - that was the way it was, because it turned out that those were the birthdays that were in our new ausweiss - our new ausweiss which didn't have a J on it.</sentence><sentence id="327">Of course, no J's on our clothes, no no stars on our on our, no yellow stars on our clothes.</sentence><sentence id="328">And uh one of the children of the family we stayed, the Bucha family, I remember saying to my brother, "Norman,"--I mean, "Jan, Jan, what's his name, Jan. You know, you have a birthday coming up pretty soon."</sentence><sentence id="329">And I said, "Oh, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="330">His birthday's not until January 3rd.</sentence><sentence id="331">We confused his birthday with a friend of his."</sentence><sentence id="332">Now unlikely story, but perfect logic to a six-year old.</sentence><sentence id="333">Uh and II that's what I remember about me - an extraordinary competence - that sounds sort of conceited but in in dealing with the</sentence><sentence id="335">situation and making up stories and it also gives me today such enormous respect for for children - I, they're capable of infinitely more you know than we ever give them credit for, so uh because I have these strong memories still of myself when I was when I was six years old.</sentence><sentence id="336">Then the next major trauma was Santa Claus.</sentence><sentence id="337">Now Santa Claus comes on December 5 in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he is, he comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and it's a non-religious holiday.</sentence><sentence id="338">It's not like Christmas here.</sentence><sentence id="339">It's Santa Claus who comes with his black moire (ph) - his name is Peter from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> on his white steed with his miter and and his staff.</sentence><sentence id="340">Uh Peter has a big uh bag on his back and if you've been a good kid then you get candy and if you've been a bad kid you get put in the bag and sent, taken back to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, so ....(laughter) and I remember being in agony because you see I believed in Santa Claus and I was quite sure that Santa Claus didn't know that my name had changed, and I couldn't tell Betty Bucha that I really wasn't Leesha Wachness - that I really was Anita Magnus - because that would let her know that I was Jewish - I mean I didn't - of course they knew, but I didn't know that they knew.</sentence><sentence id="341">So I can remember being absolutely terrified of Santa Claus coming because the way Santa Claus is in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, he comes in and visits and he sits down and you know he says, well, you know, have you been a good girl and stuff like that, and uh I felt totally trapped - that's, talking about terror - I was in pure terror.</sentence><sentence id="342">Uh and I'll never never forget when he came and already trying to make up stories about what I would say to him if, when he called me Anita.</sentence><sentence id="343">I would tell him that he was making a mistake.</sentence><sentence id="344">But he came in, and because I was the youngest of the family, uh he said well, Leesha, have you been a good girl, and my relief - thinking my God, he knows everything.</sentence><sentence id="345">You know, because I so firmly believed - it was, I'll never for...you know, I'll never forget that intense relief of not being betrayed, because even a Santa Claus could betray us.</sentence><sentence id="346">So uh when my father left us, and I'm back-tracking a little bit - my father left us, my brother and I had to go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> very early - I remember seven o'clock - uh we started to cry and that's probably the most intensive crying and I, in retrospect I think we we started with pre...pretend crying, and I'm not quite sure whether we did that because we really wanted to cry ..... [Phrase missing]...a loving, caring oh unbelievably wonderful woman.</sentence><sentence id="347">When she came upstairs, I was afraid we were going to be punished, but she she of course didn't punish us.</sentence><sentence id="348">She was very very nurturing and very loving and and seemed to understand why we were crying.</sentence><sentence id="349">But I learned early in the game during the war years uh I learned early that there was something very wrong with who I was.</sentence><sentence id="350">I mean that's probably one of the major lessons.</sentence><sentence id="351">I mean when you look at our lives I mean we were among the most fortunate of all Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> because we were not, we were out in the open.</sentence><sentence id="352">We were like Dutch children except we didn't live with our parents, and sure we were in danger and it turned out that several times they were very very close to catching us.</sentence><sentence id="353">I'll get in to that in a moment, but when you compare it to most, to most other kids who were, like Anne Frank who was hidden uh for years, you know, and they could not go out and we were infinitely more fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="354">Uh we were out.</sentence><sentence id="355">We were able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">We, and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, very progressive.</sentence><sentence id="357">Uh we had friends.</sentence><sentence id="358">We could play, could breathe fresh air and yet we also knew that, and I knew very intensively uh intensely, that I could be betrayed anytime, and so I learned early in the game that I was not to draw any attention to myself.</sentence><sentence id="359">That I could not, I had to be a very good girl.</sentence><sentence id="360">I could not be naughty.</sentence><sentence id="361">I could not do anything that would make anybody notice me.</sentence><sentence id="362">And so I learned not to complain and I learned not to express any feelings and I learned not to be a bad girl and I learned not to ever</sentence><sentence id="364">disobey because anything - I didn't dare do anything that again would make people angry at me because if they were angry at me they might betray me.</sentence><sentence id="365">So it it put this this vice around me, basically, and when I compare that to the little girl who snubbed her father you know I I am aware of what a dramatic impact that war had, uh and at and it was really the most the most poignant memory I have was oh in 1943 I think it was, uh we were riding on what's a bock... (ph)] - it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> with a big sort of uh box in front of it and that's how they would transport vegetables and stuff like that - and somebody was riding it and my brother and I were sitting in it, on the edge and I was holding on and then I noticed my brother was not holding on and I of course being you know wanting to be just as brave as he, I decided not to hold on just at the worse possible time as he was going around the corner, and I fell off the bock... (ph)], hit my head on the on the <span class="DLF">asphalt</span>, on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">I'm sure I had a concussion, but I thought I'd done something very bad, and I had the most blinding headache that I can imagine and I I went back.</sentence><sentence id="367">I didn't say anything because I thought I'd done something very bad.</sentence><sentence id="368">I didn't say anything to Betty Bucha, but I was in such pain that I would just start crying and I'd just walk out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and would come back and then I would just be in so much pain again and I would just walk out again.</sentence><sentence id="369">I remember I just was going in and out, just terrified of being noticed, so I never told her.</sentence><sentence id="370">And another time I was running and I ran into a <span class="DLF">wall</span>, and I got a a big uh cut on my forehead.</sentence><sentence id="371">My terror was about being betrayed to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="372">It wasn't about hurting.</sentence><sentence id="373">It wasn't about, you know, having fallen.</sentence><sentence id="374">It was that I had done something bad, and I was, this could meant the end of my life.</sentence><sentence id="375">I mean crazy associations.</sentence><sentence id="376">But basically I learned that uh I, you know, II was not to ever do anything that in anyway would make anybody mad at me or upset at me or or would draw attention to me.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="517">A: Oh yeah.</sentence><sentence id="518">Oh there were Germans all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="519">They were not, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> they were not as as obvious I mean you know that, during the war during the war itself because they they felt the Dutch were also Aryans so the Dutch except for the Jews were just fine and they really believed that the Dutch would eventually cooperate with them.</sentence><sentence id="520">And so for the first four years, except they did pick up a lot of Dutch men, they were quite quite lenient with the Dutch population itself and no where as vicious and brutal as they were for example with the with the Poles or with the uh with the Russians, particularly the Ukrainians because they were the untermenschen.</sentence><sentence id="521">The Dutch were supposedly part of the great Aryan race - the the super race, and it was just the Jews who were you know the vermin, according to their uh philosophy.</sentence><sentence id="522">So the Dutch, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> didn't really - no, that's not true - the underground of course suffered.</sentence><sentence id="523">I mean they, when you were caught helping Jews or if you were caught working underground but the but the but the actual occupation did not become very serious until 1944 when they finally convinced uh were convinced the Dutch were not going to join them in their uh lunacy.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="533">A: Well, we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for two years.</sentence><sentence id="534">Uh and I I did well and we stayed with this</sentence><sentence id="536">0 wonderful family for two years.</sentence><sentence id="537">We were again very fortunate - my two younger sisters were not as fortunate because they were shifted from one family to the next.</sentence><sentence id="538">But we stayed with the same family.</sentence><sentence id="539">We moved several times but that's because the Germans the Germans uh took over.</sentence><sentence id="540">I mean they, we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> near the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the Germans requisitioned that, and then we moved to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then we moved to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, but that was because the Germans just you know, when they when they wanted <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> they just kicked people out.</sentence><sentence id="541">But we just lived with the family.</sentence><sentence id="542">We would go and we visited our parents once during Christmas and uh there was there was uh and that was the first time that I had seen....I can't remember whether - that was not Christmas of "42.</sentence><sentence id="543">I think we visited them Christmas of "43.</sentence><sentence id="544">Uh I can remember in "43 I saw my mother I think for the first time because my baby sister died, uh Rita died in and she came and told us that Rita had died and I remember just crying, being incredibly unhappy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="559">Q: So your mother came to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, or to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>....?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="561">A: Yes, to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were staying, yeah, to tell us that Rita had died.</sentence><sentence id="562">And then I just remember just being very sad and crying.</sentence><sentence id="563">But the the most amazing thing was that we just sort of accepted it.</sentence><sentence id="564">You know, we never whined.</sentence><sentence id="565">We never demanded.</sentence><sentence id="566">We never we never did anything I think to betray our family or or even endanger our family.</sentence><sentence id="567">The the biggest danger to us came, well there were lots - it turned out there were lots of times when my parents were very close to being discovered - and the reason we survived is because the Dutch that, who encountered us didn't betray us.</sentence><sentence id="568">It was just the unbelievable luck that all the Dutch who discovered our Jewishness were good were good people.</sentence><sentence id="569">And that included the Dutch police.</sentence><sentence id="570">And you know again most Jews were not that fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="571">But the most dangerous time for us came in 1943 when uh my sister stayed with some teachers at that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and one of them was caught with some communist books, and when she was asked who else lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, uh she said well, two little girls.</sentence><sentence id="572">And they said immediately now that those are Jews.</sentence><sentence id="573">I mean they they assumed that any children who who weren't, who didn't live with their parents were Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="574">So that was the first time that we were going to go and visit our parents so we, the first time that I must have visited them was in the summer of "40..."43.</sentence><sentence id="575">Uh and the Germans uh we were told were going to accompany us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they were going to interrogate us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and that would have been the end of us because there is no way that we were sophisticated enough to to make up enough of a story uh particularly my younger sisters wouldn't have.</sentence><sentence id="576">They, who are one and two years younger than I am, but German thoroughness of course demanded that they could look at these Jewish children and it so happened that my younger sister and I were standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="577">Now uh I was quite, much lighter and I have blue eyes and you know, I don't, I'm not typically Jewish - I don't have a semit...I don't have Semitic features and my sister, my younger sister has blonde curly hair, blue eyed.</sentence><sentence id="578">I mean, and they looked at us and said, .</sentence><sentence id="579">You know, "They can't be Jews."</sentence><sentence id="580">So...because we didn't look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="581">And that was one of the reasons, as a matter of fact, that we were saved is because the man who gave us, was his name, who gave us the false passports, said that he he had selected us to help because we did not have Semitic features.</sentence><sentence id="582">I mean it's just a horrifying thought when you think about it, but it allowed us or the fact that we were not</sentence><sentence id="584">1 quote "typically" whatever typically Jewish is.</sentence><sentence id="585">Of course we didn't look typically Jewish - uh that's how come we survived.</sentence><sentence id="586">And again we didn't fit the German stereotype of you know typical Jews.</sentence><sentence id="587">So again we were miraculously saved.</sentence><sentence id="588">Uh I mean we miraculously not not trapped.</sentence><sentence id="589">Uh my parents had, I gather, they told me they had razor blades ready.</sentence><sentence id="590">They were not going to be caught alive.</sentence><sentence id="591">They were not.</sentence><sentence id="592">They knew what was going to happen to them and they weren't uh...and they also, they would have killed themselves because they also knew if they were caught they would betray us and so again you know there were all all these very conscious decisions were made as to trying to have as many of us survive as possible.</sentence><sentence id="593">And we were able to visit them in in the summer.</sentence><sentence id="594">I spent I think a week with them and then we visited them again in the following Christmas and there we had an accident happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="595">We were standing at a, they were they were sledding down a <span class="DLF">slope</span>, a <span class="DLF">snowy slope</span>, and mother and my sister and I were standing too close and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> ran over us.</sentence><sentence id="596">My mother had high boots on but I didn't and I got a deep wound which became severely infected and I got boils all over my body.</sentence><sentence id="597">And that was on two of my legs and which which didn't heal for months until until the following spring.</sentence><sentence id="598">Again lucky that I was strong enough, we survived - you know, there wasn't any penicillin and uh so on.</sentence><sentence id="599">But basically in 19...for two years we lived as school children and we lived without our parents and we lived with fear and I can remember saying to one of the other girls, the daughter of the family, I said I have a very big secret but I can't tell you until the war is over. (</sentence><sentence id="600">Laughter) I, it was like, you know, I was like I knew the war one day would be over, so I must have a lot of hope uh and a lot a lot of optimism.</sentence><sentence id="601">I guess I must have felt that we would live.</sentence><sentence id="602">Uh and at the same time I remember my major mission was not to do anything that would betray us.</sentence><sentence id="603">And my middle, my younger sisters would sometimes really do dumb things like well, dumb things, what do you expect of a - I was six, so they were four and five.</sentence><sentence id="604">I remember Ingrid at one point, we were walking and she said oh she said oh Leesha - I was Leesha - Leesha, you know I met a I met a girl whose name was Ingrid and I told her that used to be my name.</sentence><sentence id="605">And I said don't ever say that (laughter) - I remember having to remind her that she was not to not to ever ever uh uh you know remind anyone or tell anybody that that Lanie wasn't her real name.</sentence><sentence id="606">But what's remarkable is that we played we the game right on until the very end.</sentence><sentence id="607">Uh and again turned out that the only people knew we were Jewish was the family itself.</sentence><sentence id="608">Their children didn't know we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="609">And, but we made friends and we saw our parents every once in a while and uh again unbelievable fortune fell our way because uh at in 1944 my, when after the Normandy landing uh things became very tight and that's when the Germans became more vicious towards the Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="610">We had gone with the family to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in and there was a lot of bombing, a lot of strafing, and the family told my parents they could no longer be responsible for us.</sentence><sentence id="611">So that was, that was August of "44 and my mother came - my mother has always been very brave.</sentence><sentence id="612">My father has said if it weren't for my mother and her courage we would never have survived the war, because she again and again and again, she would be the one who who said to my father, you know, it's going to work out and she would she would take on the police who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and questioned them and interrogated them, cause see from their perspective they were interrogated many times about who they were and what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="613">Now they were out in the <span class="DLF">open</span> too, but my father wasn't working and so their story was a more difficult one than ours, and so they had continual contact with [Pinkstrum (ph)], the one who gave us the false papers, and he again</sentence><sentence id="615">2 throughout the war continued to help us make up stories supporting my parents!</sentence><sentence id="616">stories and so on so that if we had had one NSB--which was the Nazi...which was the Nazi support group in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="617">If we had had one real Nazi supporter, we would never have made it.</sentence><sentence id="618">But uh somehow, again, we...we didn't.</sentence><sentence id="619">But in 1944, my mother came to get us.</sentence><sentence id="620">She got my brother and me; and my two younger sisters already were with her.</sentence><sentence id="621">And incredibly, in September of 1944, we were liberated by the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="622">Uh they came up, they had landed in Normandy, and they came up through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and just through a tiny part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="623">And they were supposed to meet up with the British at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span>.</sentence><sentence id="624">They made a movie, "The <span class="DLF">bridge</span>...", "A <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> Too Far."</sentence><sentence id="625">And, of course, there was a German panzer division at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Armbhem</span>;

She said, "If I had known you were Jews, you would never have lived."</sentence><sentence id="631">horrible woman.</sentence><sentence id="632">Her name was Bilders (ph)].</sentence><sentence id="633">Anyway, we, my, there was so much bombing that my parents, my mother came to get us and we were standing in the in the front living room, and my mother was combing my hair, and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> here - my mother was standing here and I was standing right there - and there was the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="634">And a grenade exploded.</sentence><sentence id="635">And a big piece of the grenade flew right between my mother and me and scorched her nose.</sentence><sentence id="636">And it bounced against the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, and it bounced back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and a pair of pajamas and the pajamas burst burst into flames, but again you know death was so close.</sentence><sentence id="637">Uh it's it's just miraculous - a few inches either direction would have killed either my mother or me.</sentence><sentence id="638">Uh so we got out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and we spent the day in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, and we heard all the shooting.</sentence><sentence id="639">My mother again was very brave.</sentence><sentence id="640">She would go upstairs and I'm I'll never forget at four o'clock, it was about four o'clock and she would go upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="641">At four o'clock she screamed - she said the Americans are here.</sentence><sentence id="642">And I, if there's anything that stands out in my memory it's it's those words - the Americans, the Americans were here.</sentence><sentence id="643">And the Americans coming up on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> - uh we lived sort of on a <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and the Amer...the Germans were retreating up the <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and they were shooting down at the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="644">Of course we were dying to go upstairs, and uh see what was happening, uh and we were allowed to, after a while we were allowed to go up, and I cannot tell you what that meant.</sentence><sentence id="645">I, it's a memory that you know will never cease in my mind.</sentence><sentence id="646">As, I think <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> has always had such a close place in my heart because it meant it meant life for us, and in all sorts of ways, and that was before we had any idea we would ever come here.</sentence><sentence id="647">Uh but there were the American soldiers and they were being shot at by the Germans but it didn't seem to bother them very much.</sentence><sentence id="648">They were ducking the bullets.</sentence><sentence id="649">And then after a few days when we were allowed to go - perhaps two days I think - we were not allowed to go out because there was so much shooting going on, but after a few days we were allowed to go out - one of the best sights I remember seeing was Germans with their " This battle took place September 17-25, 1944.</sentence><sentence id="651">3 arms, you know, over their head and the feeling that they no longer present the threat to us and that we no longer were in danger was just a relief and an over-whelming sense that, you know, it's hard to describe.</sentence><sentence id="652">I mean talking about freedom and I was then eight years old and I'll never forget that immense relief.</sentence><sentence id="653">What was amazing was that uh in December of course we had the Battle of the Bulge, and at that point everybody knew we were Jewish - some, everybody knew - that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that we lived in was uh , a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="654">Of course then it was clear you know, we made it and let people know that we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="655">Then we had the Battle of the Bulge, and that - I remember being terrified of that because if the Germans had won that, I knew that would be the end of us again.</sentence><sentence id="656">So there was was some more fear then, but then when the Americans won, the Allies won, then I think we really felt that we had survived uh and just that we would live.</sentence><sentence id="657">And then one of the hardest things was for my poor mother to get back to our original names.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="760">Q: Tell me about that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="762">A: Well, I mean all of a sudden instead of being Jan and Leesha and Lanie and Hennie, we had to...we were again Norman and Anita and Ingrid and Helga.</sentence><sentence id="763">And I can remember her saying Leesha, , Lanie - oh, whatever your names are, you know, come <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">We uh we uh it was it was unbelievable to go back and be with our parents again.</sentence><sentence id="765">Uh and I can remember thinking I will never ever ever leave them again.</sentence><sentence id="766">It was just like, it was like having a whole new life.</sentence><sentence id="767">Uh we had some very, some interesting times because we that's the first time that I saw black people.</sentence><sentence id="768">Uh we were liberated by the American Army; and the blacks were separated, segre...segregated.</sentence><sentence id="769">So they lived in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, and the Ameri...and the whites were uh in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="770">And I can remember asking my mother, "Why are they so black?,"</sentence><sentence id="771">you know.</sentence><sentence id="772">I couldn't understand that skin could be black, because we...the <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> didn't have any dark people.</sentence><sentence id="773">And I, I remember saying to her, you know, "Why don't they use clorox?</sentence><sentence id="774">Perhaps that would..." (Laughter) Just didn't seem... it didn't...didn't make any sense to me.</sentence><sentence id="775">And we were scared of them.</sentence><sentence id="776">But then we were fascinated by them; and they were wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="777">We would go and sort of talk to them, and they'd give us big chocolates.</sentence><sentence id="778">And uh the Americans who...the American soldiers stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>; and I remember we would go down there.</sentence><sentence id="779">My parents had told us you never ask for anything.</sentence><sentence id="780">Now the Dutch kids, you know, I mean that had had nothing for a long time... I mean, that's the first time we saw oranges, the first time we had candy--all of that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="781">Food had been rationed.</sentence><sentence id="782">Food was mini...had the minimal.</sentence><sentence id="783">So we'd go there; and we'd stand there and look at them with our big eyes.</sentence><sentence id="784">And, of course, the soldiers just loved us because we never asked for anything.</sentence><sentence id="785">We always ended up with the most. (</sentence><sentence id="786">Laughter) And my youngest sister, Helga, would pick up soldiers, which was fine because she was six years old.</sentence><sentence id="787">And one day she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a chaplain - said, "Mommy, that's the best I could find." (</sentence><sentence id="788">Laughter) So we ...that was our first encounter with Americans.</sentence><sentence id="789">We met uh a Jewish soldier - a guy name from <span class="REGION">California</span>, who became a very good friend of ours, and uh it was almost like we had to get used to being out in the open again and regaining our own identity.</sentence><sentence id="790">And it's only in retrospect that I now realize what a hugh price we paid.</sentence><sentence id="791">Because you know when you're going through this as a child that's the way life is.</sentence><sentence id="792">You don't really question it.</sentence><sentence id="793">You do what you have to do, and given those circumstances, children will follow the rules.</sentence><sentence id="794">At least all of,</sentence><sentence id="796">4 we did.</sentence><sentence id="797">But uh right smack after the war you see, I mean not even after the war because the rest of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wasn't liberated, some very bad things started to happen.</sentence><sentence id="798">Uh the part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> that we lived in was all Catholic - one hundred percent Catholic - and so as soon as it became known that we were Jewish, we got things like Christ killers, dirty Jews, uh - <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> which really had not known anti-Semitism before the war, the horror of of World War II is that it awakened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I think an awful lot of anti-Semitism, a tremendous amount.</sentence><sentence id="799">And we started encountering that - I mean in retrospect it just blows me away to think that uh there was no debriefing.</sentence><sentence id="800">Nobody ever ever talked to us about what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="801">There was no counseling.</sentence><sentence id="802">There was no support.</sentence><sentence id="803">It was as if we now were, we had to enter a new but it was a foreign society - it wasn't <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> the way we had known it because we became we became dirty Jews.</sentence><sentence id="804">Now not by officialdom necessarily, but the children uh I remember that soon after - because we hadn't gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you know in the meantime you can imagine what our schooling must have been like, uh very interrupted, very sporadic, and the first four years if I had, if 1 went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> two years it was a lot.</sentence><sentence id="805">Uh by the time I was eight, let's see, nine - by the time I was nine I think I had been to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> about two years at the most.</sentence><sentence id="806">So my father taught me a lot at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="807">But I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again after not having been in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for six months or so, and there was a birthday party and we were the only ones who were not invited to go to the birthday party, and my father took us on a big walk and he consoled us.</sentence><sentence id="808">But it was just, see we had to come, we had been non-people, and then we remained outsiders.</sentence><sentence id="809">Uh we stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> uh we that we left the family and went and stayed with a woman whose husband had been a a Nazi, and so he was imprisoned and she was forced to take us.</sentence><sentence id="810">Now she was scared of us - she thought that we would, I don't know what she thought we would do, but uh so we lived there you know for a couple of months, because we could not go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> because the Germans were still occupying so much of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="811">And even though <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> was also liberated pretty soon after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Limburg</span>, uh it still wasn't safe to travel.</sentence><sentence id="812">So uh, we kept on going to - and all the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="813">I mean, that that again talking about the intense necessity for free...you know, for separation of <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and state - uh I'll never forget the experience we had having to go, having no choice but to go to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic schools</span>, and and being called Christ killers.</sentence><sentence id="814">Now that only intensified the feelings that the war had fostered in me - the feelings that there was something wrong with me and being a Jew was a bad thing.</sentence><sentence id="815">Uh ashamed of being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="816">Uncomfortable being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="817">Uh something that you wanted to hide.</sentence><sentence id="818">It wasn't OK to be who you are.</sentence><sentence id="819">You were different and you know how bad it is for children to be different - I mean how hard it is for them to be .</sentence><sentence id="820">It's bad for kids to be different.</sentence><sentence id="821">It's hard for kids to be different.</sentence><sentence id="822">Uh and so we felt that we never, we just never fitted in and as soon as we could we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> which was not until I think April of 1945, so for about four months we lived very tightly with our family but the best thing was that our family was back together.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="900">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="901">We we finally were able to leave, I think we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> in April of "45.</sentence><sentence id="902">We were, all of you know the war ended in May of "45, May 5, 1945 in in Europe and we went back to - we had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="903">Of course what had happened is my parents had left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived in and my mo...my mother had had oh just her her dowry had been this gorgeous stuff and and of course everything was left behind and we came back with nothing.</sentence><sentence id="904">We stayed for about six weeks with a family where my aunt had stayed - the one who, my mother's sister, the one who was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="905">We stayed there and then uh after six weeks the woman said to us, well you can't stay here any more.</sentence><sentence id="906">And we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="907">So we moved into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had been bombed and the whole backside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> - there was no backside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at all.</sentence><sentence id="908">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="909">It was a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but you know it was uninhabitable.</sentence><sentence id="910">It had no gas and electricity.</sentence><sentence id="911">It had no water and uh again we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go so we moved in.</sentence><sentence id="912">We basically squatted into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="913">And the the water just poured in and it just because it had no backside, uh just poured in.</sentence><sentence id="914">So my father just made holes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> so the water would run down.</sentence><sentence id="915">He boarded up some of the other uh <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with uh planks so that we could at least sleep there.</sentence><sentence id="916">And for a couple of weeks we would go to neighbors to get water and so on.</sentence><sentence id="917">It was just, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to go and we had absolutely nothing.</sentence><sentence id="918">My father didn't have a job.</sentence><sentence id="919">We didn't have any money, so he got a job with the British censorship in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so, so in 19... uh... 1940 ...I think, that was "45 I think - it was almost immediately after the war uh after we were liberated, he went off to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and worked for the British censorship there.</sentence><sentence id="920">So my mother was left alone with four children and her aging grandfather-- her aging father, my grandfather, who lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="921">Some friends uh had given him aroom.</sentence><sentence id="922">And so we lived in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, in this bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for about six months.</sentence><sentence id="923">In the meantime my mother was alone.</sentence><sentence id="924">My brother could not adjust to the <span class="BUILDING">school system</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="925">We...the closest <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to us was a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span>; so instead of going to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>, we went to a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="926">And again being the outsider was so obvious because of religion.</sentence><sentence id="927">We did not belong in a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>, and it was uncomfortable and it made us feel uh unwanted.</sentence><sentence id="928">Now we did not encounter there any uh of the anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="929">I mean nobody there called us Christ killers or any of that stuff but we were not accepted either.</sentence><sentence id="930">Well, finally my - the only way you could get a habitable <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was by finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that people would move out of.</sentence><sentence id="931">And then you had to present it to the Notes Commission, which is the housing need commission and then they would rule on whether you were eligible to move into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="932">And several times my mother would find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we would never get it and it would, the situation got to be pretty desperate.</sentence><sentence id="933">Well, finally we found a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the Juliana (ph), and it was uh next to a little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the conservation company.</sentence><sentence id="934">And we were, and the way that it went was that you had to uh tell the tell the commission where the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was and uh then they would decide.</sentence><sentence id="935">But because they continually took, wouldn't let my mother move into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, my mother said you know, I'm not going to tell you where it is unless you let me know that I can have it, and they would, she finally was promised that that they could have the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="936">And we were</sentence><sentence id="938">6 assigned that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and just before we were supposed to move in, the head of that conservation company wanted that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it was right next to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="939">And again we were, they told that, we were told we couldn't live in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="940">In the meantime you know we lived in an unhabitable, uninhabitable <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was, just made the situation terrible.</sentence><sentence id="941">My mother was alone.</sentence><sentence id="942">She was close to a nervous breakdown I think.</sentence><sentence id="943">She had been so strong during the war.</sentence><sentence id="944">She was, she had crying spells and she was in agony over : It's hard for me to fathom now really she survived as well as she did under the intense kind of suffering.</sentence><sentence id="945">I mean she came back and it was very clear to us that almost our whole family had been wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="946">Her only sister and her...her daughter were wiped out.</sentence><sentence id="947">My father came from a family of seven brothers and sisters.</sentence><sentence id="948">Only he and his oldest brother survived; and my uncle's only son, Bert (ph), had been killed by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="949">We had two cousins who survived.</sentence><sentence id="950">They escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, but their parents and their...that was their sister, that was the girl that I visited before the war - the family I visited.</sentence><sentence id="951">They were killed.</sentence><sentence id="952">They were dragged out of and .</sentence><sentence id="953">They died probably en route to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and we, I don't know really what happened to .</sentence><sentence id="954">So after the war you know, there we were.</sentence><sentence id="955">And of the Dutch, the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.581859" long="4.747456">Breda</span>, I think a total of twenty survived.</sentence><sentence id="956">Two young men survived the labor, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> - young, strong men.</sentence><sentence id="957">And the Alters, the...the photographer - he was killed and she survived with her two daughters.</sentence><sentence id="958">But for the rest, just we were alone.</sentence><sentence id="959">And so anyway so she, under those circumstances again, and then living in this this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and again being denied that denied that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> uh, what in effect we did is that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that that we had gone to became a very fashionable <span class="BUILDING">school</span> after the war and the Dutch princesses went there.</sentence><sentence id="960">Juliana's daughters went there; and uh when again we were denied that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> my mother went to uh the friends who where my fath...where my grandfather was staying, and he had some, he knew some people who were higher-ups and basically they, he said to that commission, he said unless Mrs. Magnus, , gets that <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, this is going to go straight up to the Queen, and these, the response was oh those damn Jews - they want so much again.</sentence><sentence id="961">And I just, the anti- Semitism which really had been dormant I think, or had, I I just don't think <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was anti- Semitic before the war.</sentence><sentence id="962">If it was anti-Semitic it was well-hidden, but the Germans - and that's one of the horrors for me - in some ways the Germans won the war, because they succeeded.</sentence><sentence id="963">They made the Europe Judenrein; they made it Jew-free.</sentence><sentence id="964">And there is uh, I still pick it up when I go to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="965">There is an awful lot of anti-Semitism in Europe and they awakened the viciousness.</sentence><sentence id="966">So that you see, that's what we had to live with then after the war.</sentence><sentence id="967">And it was never overt - well, that's not true.</sentence><sentence id="968">It was overt.</sentence><sentence id="969">I mean you know - those damned Jews - they want so much again basically was the response to us.</sentence><sentence id="970">Uh but we did get the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">I mean the threat of using, of going straight to the queen and of using some some influence there - in effect we were assigned that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so in December of "45, it was very tragic because my grandfather died of a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="972">My mother tried to get him in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="973">They wouldn't take him to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">And he died of a heart attack.</sentence><sentence id="975">So there was mother just with her father just dead and the horror of the war, moving...
