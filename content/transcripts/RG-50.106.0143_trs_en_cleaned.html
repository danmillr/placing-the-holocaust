<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="948">A: Yes, I did, because there were times, going even back to 1939 where we did visit her at her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="949">And she had a -- an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the better part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheneberg</span> and we did visit her.</sentence><sentence id="950">Sometimes she had dinner for us.</sentence><sentence id="951">And, in fact there were times th -- when she picked us up where we lived and we did remove our Star of David when we had to wear it, and we went with</sentence><sentence id="953">USHMM Archives RG-50.</sentence><sentence id="954">106*0143 22 her to her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there we were very safe because she also -- I think she had a special I.D.or something, that she was a high ranking Nazi member, a personal friend of Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="955">So nobody bothered her when -- especially when we were with her, too.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="977">Q: Even at that time, and we'll get to more later, of course.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="979">A: Okay, when I was younger I couldn't figure that out at all, but now, being older and seeing what has happened, my guess is that she was such a Nazi fanatic, she was a good friend of Hitler and deep inside she was convinced that Hitler did not know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="980">She used to tell that to my father, to my mother, that Hitler doesn't know what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="981">Once he learns what's going on, he's going to stop that.</sentence><sentence id="982">And I believe because of that mentality, she was convinced if she would be caught helping us, that Hitler would free her and she would say everything to Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="983">A-And I think that's the only reason that I can think of why she helped us.</sentence><sentence id="984">And of course she mu-must also feel that she brought me onto this world.</sentence><sentence id="985">And I think that's the only reason.</sentence><sentence id="986">And I think I'm the only Jewish person she ever assisted in a birth.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1026">A: Well, in 1943, one day our father didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1027">And again, we did have a number of n- non-Jewish friends that were against the Hitler regime.</sentence><sentence id="1028">And it was one woman that says, leave your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, the Germans are arresting everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1029">They took your father away, he's -- he was arrested.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1510">A: Well, it got so that we didn't know where to go any more and the bombing was ak -- like I said earlier, day and night.</sentence><sentence id="1511">And the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelters</span> were overcrowded.</sentence><sentence id="1512">We couldn't get in, and to be in a <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> again as kids, had to be in Hitler youth uniform, which we didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="1513">And we were afraid to be caught in a bomb shelter, so we stayed in <span class="BUILDING">subway stations</span>, which a lot of other Germans, at the end stayed, because the <span class="BUILDING">subway stations</span> were pretty deep down and they were probably one of the safest <span class="NPIP">places</span> to be until bef -- the day before the Russians came in.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1612">Q: Were you angry then that you were Jewish and so you had to go through all these terrible -- this terrible ordeal?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1626">A: Until the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1627">Actually, what happened is we were at one <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span>, and all of a sudden it started being flooded, water came gushing through there.</sentence><sentence id="1628">And all the people that were at that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> started moving -- the s-subways were not running -- on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> to another <span class="BUILDING">station</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1629">And very few of us had anything to eat or to drink.</sentence><sentence id="1630">Some people started drinking the water that was stuving -- coming through, and most of those people actually died due to diseases, I think typhoid or whatever it brought.</sentence><sentence id="1631">And there were times my brother and I were going to drink it, and we kind of kept each other from drinking it.</sentence><sentence id="1632">We knew that that is dirty, we're not going to</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="1636">USHMM Archives RG-50.</sentence><sentence id="1637">106*0143 37 drink it.</sentence><sentence id="1638">And we, with quite a few other Germans, moved to the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, which was not flooded then.</sentence><sentence id="1639">And we probably spent -- and my -- our mother was still alive then, and -- who kind of kept us, too, from drinking it.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And we got to the other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> that was not flooded, and -- but we needed water, and so my mother went outside the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> upstairs to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire hydrant</span> to get water.</sentence><sentence id="1641">And she didn't come back down.</sentence><sentence id="1642">And I went up and I do remember seeing her lying at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire hydrant</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1643">And actually she was killed, I don't know if it was German or Russians, but the crossfire between the Russians and the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1644">And so -- and I never could get the water, I was forced to go back down into the <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> by German soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1645">I was a kid, and he forced me to go back down.</sentence><sentence id="1646">And I would say that same day, all of a sudden two Russian soldiers came into that <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> with Tommy guns -- machine guns in each hand and everyone -- everyone down in that <span class="DLF">subway tunnel</span> started clapping.</sentence><sentence id="1647">There were a few German soldiers there, they threw down their weapons and surrendered to those two Russian

id="1654">Q: -an-and how did you break the news to your brother?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1655">A: Okay, at the time I didn't know if she really was dead or just injured.</sentence><sentence id="1656">And I told my brother I saw our mother, she was up at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire hydrant</span>, but the Germans wouldn't let me get to it, and I think she is okay, but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1657">That's really what I told him.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And I didn't know, I -- it was just the way I felt.</sentence><sentence id="1659">And of course we never did see her again.</sentence><sentence id="1660">And, in fact, up to this day, I do not know if she was killed or injured because the Russians took a lot of -- especially women and</sentence><sentence id="1662">USHMM Archives RG-50.</sentence><sentence id="1663">106*0143 38 children, they loaded them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and s-shipped them to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, especially women.</sentence><sentence id="1664">In fact, after the war my brother and I were loaded onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> many times to be -- to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, but we knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> like a book, we -- there wasn't an address we couldn't find.</sentence><sentence id="1665">And we, for awhile were guides to some of the Russian officers going from point A to point B.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1679">Q: Previous to you losing your mother, were di-- di--- wasn't there a situation where you were taken away?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1681">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1682">We didn't -- we didn't cover that.</sentence><sentence id="1683">Yes, again, like I said, we moved around freely under false I.D., and again in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span>, and I was there by myself.</sentence><sentence id="1684">I think I may have been on my way to this midwife, Noelting, because she had some groceries for us.</sentence><sentence id="1685">And we'd do that, sometimes my brother went to see her.</sentence><sentence id="1686">And this was on April 15", 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1687">I was caught in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1688">And the reason is they had what I always feared, we all of us feared, an I.D. check.</sentence><sentence id="1689">And they had an I.D.check and I had the I.D., I was -- I don't remember the first name, the last name was Schmitz.</sentence><sentence id="1690">But I didn't have my Hitler youth card with me.</sentence><sentence id="1691">So again, they make you drop the pants and they knew pretty much if you didn't have the Hitler youth I.D. you were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="1692">And of course, to a 12 year old having to drop their pants in front of everybody was a humiliation to begin with.</sentence><sentence id="1693">And of course, I was circumcised, Jewish, and they --I was arrested.</sentence><sentence id="1694">They tied me up, my hands behind my back, very tightly and they took me to Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse 9.</sentence><sentence id="1695">That was the <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1696">And they had a kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, like a <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> where they questioned people, not just Jews, even Germans that helped Jews, or others that talked against the regime, they were tortured at that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1697">And again, according to the archives -- the archives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> do not s- say what happened to me when I was arrested April 15".</sentence><sentence id="1698">It only showed that on April 17", I was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> on a t -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span>, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1699">Well, for t-- two days there, between the 15" and the 17", I was tortured, but they didn't get any information out of me because they beat me and</sentence><sentence id="1701">USHMM Archives RG-50.</sentence><sentence id="1702">106*0143 39 things they did, pulling teeth out, I have

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1704">And that was April 17, according to the archives.</sentence><sentence id="1705">And I ended up, after two days roughly, i-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>, which I believe was the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that still was open and there with a route between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1706">And of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1707">I never left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1708">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> that I was in was mostly -- were mostly Russian soldiers, men and women soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1709">There were, I think, a couple of kids my age in there and a few other women and men, Germans, Jews, I do not know.</sentence><sentence id="1710">Then there were a whole bunch of people on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that were already dead, or were trampled to death, or been there a lot longer.</sentence><sentence id="1711">I don't know how long they save, you know, kept the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> until it was full, completely full.</sentence><sentence id="1712">So there were a number of people that I know were dead.</sentence><sentence id="1713">There was nothing to eat, no water and no sanitation facilities.</sentence><sentence id="1714">And it was -- it was the worst <span class="NPIP">hell</span> I've ever been in.</sentence><sentence id="1715">And it was either April 19 or April 20", I do not know.</sentence><sentence id="1716">Again, during th -- fr -- apar -- from the records that were kept, I turned up missing April 20".</sentence><sentence id="1717">It may have been th-the day before.</sentence><sentence id="1718">But during and air raid, there was an air raid, and somebody during that air raid opened up the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railcar</span> that we were in.</sentence><sentence id="1719">Why, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1720">I kind of think is that the German guards -- they were SS, they were volunteers to be there, I think knew the allies were right outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> was liberated April 29".</sentence><sentence id="1721">And this was let's -- let's say this was April 20".</sentence><sentence id="1722">And so I think to be maybe he or she, whoever opened the <span class="DLF">railcar door</span> figured maybe they'd get better treatment.</sentence><sentence id="1723">And so that <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and whoever was strong enough, jumped out.</sentence><sentence id="1724">I followed a bunch of Russian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1725">There must have been 15 or 20 of them that I followed, and it wasn't too far.</sentence><sentence id="1726">We ended up on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where there were nothing but Hitler youth and a few German
