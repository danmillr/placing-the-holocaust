class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was still under the government, the democratic government that had nothing to do with Hitler, but the Germans beca -- stopped talking to me and ignoring me [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="28">I went to study to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where the situation, even though it was a [indecipherable] regime, for the Jews there was no

one time, they had [indecipherable] students in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> and they want -- they made a big fuss and so on, so the Italian students went with us again
