you know what you're talking.</sentence><sentence id="359">This is a death sentence.</sentence><sentence id="360">I don't care.</sentence><sentence id="361">To me it's worth it.</sentence><sentence id="362">There you are.</sentence><sentence id="363">So that was going fine.</sentence><sentence id="364">There was a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> which to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frieda</span> was working.</sentence><sentence id="365">I was happy.</sentence><sentence id="366">She was happy.</sentence><sentence id="367">I was doing the whole work.</sentence><sentence id="368">I had a nice pair of horses there.</sentence><sentence id="369">I take care of the whole <span class="DLF">farm</span> because the farmer, he was a little guy, you know, and he didn't want</sentence><sentence id="371">to work hard see.</sentence><sentence id="372">He had a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="373">Well,when there was anything to do with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span>, he was sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span>, you know, but with the horses the most job, you know, I was doing, you know.</sentence><sentence id="374">He was 01:27: very glad and I was working hard and same thing Frieda was working on that little <span class="DLF">farm</span> where she was.</sentence><sentence id="375">She was working fine.</sentence><sentence id="376">Everything was there fine, but meantime the Gestapo told the farmer where Frieda was working...look and watch it because she had something to do with Polish guy.</sentence><sentence id="377">If you know anything, if you notice anything, let us know.</sentence><sentence id="378">And good enough...how long you can hide.</sentence><sentence id="379">Sooner or later they found...they did find out...I don't know how...that that we was together, and he didn't make any report to the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="380">So long Frieda was working there, fine.</sentence><sentence id="381">But Frieda make one mistake.</sentence><sentence id="382">She want to quit that <span class="DLF">farm</span> and go work in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span>, more money, more time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="383">And that was the biggest mistake Frieda make.</sentence><sentence id="384">And that's what the trouble start right then.</sentence><sentence id="385">So when the little farmer where Frieda was working find out she going to quit, she call up...he call up the Gestapo and Frieda was arrested first.</sentence><sentence id="386">I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="387">And we had a...we had a date at that time, you know.</sentence><sentence id="388">That was on end of the week, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="389">I go over there and where we usually meet, Frieda wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="390">So I had a bad feeling.</sentence><sentence id="391">Something happened.</sentence><sentence id="392">Is she sick?</sentence><sentence id="393">But there was no way to find out.</sentence><sentence id="394">But I no have to wait long to find out what happen.</sentence><sentence id="395">So good enough...that was I believe was on a Friday, September 19, 1941.</sentence><sentence id="396">We was digging potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="397">I was working on on my <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="398">01:29: I mean on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> where I was

class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="404">We was eating and here to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> comes the policeman and he talk, because the farmer and his wife and the old parents, they was eating in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we was eating the workers...there was two girls and a one Frenchman, a prisoner, prisoner from the French army...Louis...he was with us.</sentence><sentence id="405">We was eating there and I hear in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>...I hear my

id="408">And he was putting down.</sentence><sentence id="409">Then nice, not rush, the policeman was waiting till we finish and then he come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and says, Julius Noga...I was called by Julius in German.</sentence><sentence id="410">Julius Noga.</sentence><sentence id="411">I want you to dress up and pick up whatever you want to pick up and you go with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="412">I says sir, is that Gestapo?</sentence><sentence id="413">Yep.</sentence><sentence id="414">Ah...to live or

up.</sentence><sentence id="419">Wash you up.</sentence><sentence id="420">Dress you up, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="421">I wait for you.</sentence><sentence id="422">So I go to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="423">I go to my two horses, you know.</sentence><sentence id="424">I clap them.</sentence><sentence id="425">I give them some more oats, a little more hay.</sentence><sentence id="426">I clap them.</sentence><sentence id="427">I know...I know I no going to see those horses any more.</sentence><sentence id="428">Then I dressed

don't take too much.</sentence><sentence id="431">You don't need it.</sentence><sentence id="432">I know I don't need it.</sentence><sentence id="433">So here was another very important...I don't know how much did help.</sentence><sentence id="434">Now Polish worker not supposed to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and not supposed to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="435">Now the Polish people was treated very...you know, Polish worker, you know...they're worse, you know.</sentence><sentence

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, but not Polish people.</sentence><sentence id="439">There was strict, very strict.</sentence><sentence id="440">So but many times when I go see Frieda on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, there was...I forget...oh probably what was it...forty, fifty...no, forty kilometer, so ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> was a little bit too far for me you know.</sentence><sentence id="441">What I was doing I go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> on a on a <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> and put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span>, the first one always was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="442">Put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> on the</sentence><sentence id="444"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and go to the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>...you know, pay extra...it was cheap, you know, that time.</sentence><sentence id="445">Take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and go wherever you want to go.</sentence><sentence id="446">But here we come on that <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> with the policeman and we supposed to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> what was only sixteen, eighteen kilometers, _?? ,</sentence><sentence id="447">and this is close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp

him a little canned milk, see, and each time I go somewhere when he was there, he sold me the train tickets, you see.</sentence><sentence id="450">So the first thing the policeman asked him, did you

November.</sentence><sentence id="604">Short before Christmas, the Gestapo...I don't know for what reason take us, about thirteen guys, put us in a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and bring us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> closer to the previous <span class="DLF">farm</span> where Frieda's parents are.</sentence><sentence id="605">Was the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> though, pretty 01:45; good sized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they put us in an old <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and I remember the the <span class="DLF">street</span>, SA Strasse.</sentence><sentence id="606">And there was a very small <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, very old <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and we stayed there over the Christmas and during the winter two guys come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>, from the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, a prisoner, Polish guy, and they tell us what the Gestapo do.</sentence><sentence id="607">They hanging people in the</sentence><sentence id="609"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they send to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and you...it's going to happen same thing to us.</sentence><sentence id="610">So what should we do?</sentence><sentence id="611">My gosh...this is occasion over here.</sentence><sentence id="612">We might have a chance to run away from this, from this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> see.</sentence><sentence id="613">There was two old guards and the inspector and that was the ??</sentence><sentence id="614">how many prisoners there.</sentence><sentence id="615">They coming and going oh maybe twenty, thirty prisoners, you know.</sentence><sentence id="616">They coming for short time, you know, like those guys don't want to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> or do some something wrong, you know, and they give them for the...they give them for the few...jail for the few days.</sentence><sentence id="617">You are no bread, nothing and no food and they keep them three, four, five days hungry, you know, and they give them good advice, you know.</sentence><sentence id="618">Go back and work.</sentence><sentence id="619">Next time when you come, we going to keep you here two weeks without the food or we're going to send you to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so they they scared the people.</sentence><sentence id="620">OK.</sentence><sentence id="621">So now here what we're doing here...what's the what's the reason they bring us over here.</sentence><sentence id="622">Nobody knows, but those two guys tell us we better run away if we got chance.</sentence><sentence id="623">OK.</sentence><sentence id="624">So how we going to run away?</sentence><sentence id="625">There was thirteen guys all together, all Polish.</sentence><sentence id="626">We was on that <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, so one of them was shoemaker.</sentence><sentence id="627">Walter was his name.</sentence><sentence id="628">He was a shoemaker.</sentence><sentence id="629">He says you...that bar in the <span class="DLF">window</span>, if we cut just one of them and we lifted it, we can go through, and there was a screen, thin screen.</sentence><sentence id="630">If you cut just the one, you you you can make a <span class="DLF">hole</span>.</sentence><sentence id="631">You can open it, see.</sentence><sentence id="632">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="633">But where we going to

just like that, you know, steady.</sentence><sentence id="685">No.</sentence><sentence id="686">They upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="687">Maybe somebody hear, so we tied the bar with the blanket and go just a little bit, slow you know, and believe me...about four o'clock in the morning...we start about nine o'clock in the evening to cut little by little.</sentence><sentence id="688">About four o'clock in the morning we got that through and there was a square <span class="DLF">bar</span>, I should say one inch by one inch thick.</sentence><sentence id="689">And good enough there was not so tight together, so we cut the second one on the bottom.</sentence><sentence id="690">There was only one cross bar in the middle, so we figured out when we cut it on the bottom, so we grab it and bend it up and this was big enough...what we had to do just to the thin screen was <span class="NPIP">outside</span>...just cut the once you know, and then we run away.</sentence><sentence id="691">Then...but before we did it, we swear, we make a promise...we go all of us, thirteen guys.</sentence><sentence id="692">We go out, and we all decided to run away.</sentence><sentence

work there, for short time, so he took two guys and they were there oh I'd say for a couple of hours.</sentence><sentence id="700">Then they coming back, and that <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> was already cut, so when they come back we ask, did the guard ask you something?</sentence><sentence id="701">Did he notice...notice anything?</sentence><sentence id="702">No, no, no,

class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1366">I thought they going to send me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1367">No, but for some reason they send me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1368">So next day, OK.</sentence><sentence id="1369">They pick up...I believe there was forty-six of us.</sentence><sentence id="1370">I was the only one Pole, Polish guy in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1371">They cuff our hands two and two, and they bring us down to the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> down below and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> without a top, that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> what they usually bring the prisoners from the from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo building</span> what was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there, a new <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1372">They bring us on a <span class="BUILDING">rail depot</span> and they put us on a on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span> and that was small <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> you call it... three men or four men to the one <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>, yeah, and two of them can sit and two of them stand and then we change, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1373">So we come as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> in 02:09: <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1374">Then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> we stay overnight...some kind of old <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, big <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, all of us was laying there.</sentence><sentence id="1375">There was some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we stay over night and this is very interesting because all documents in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and on the Gestapo, all documents from the foreigners was destroyed, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>, that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for some reason I don't understand even when you go today, when you call up, they keep that record and says Julian Noga stay over night here in a on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span>, and this is the only evidence there in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> where is I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Flossenberg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1376">I got some other witnesses, but that's what is still, you know, the the the best proof, you know, I was on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span>, so the next stop was we stay overnight from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1377">Also in some kind of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and this what I meet...how should I say...my good luck.</sentence><sentence id="1378">As we was there was late in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="1379">They bring a tall guy, brunette, tall guy, strong guy by the name Hans Bauer (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1380">Now Hans Bauer was in a <span class="BUILDING">German jail</span> for ten years.</sentence><sentence id="1381">He served his term and the and he was free, but the Gestapo was waiting for him and pick him up and put him in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> like they did with all others, criminals were told that.</sentence><sentence id="1382">So always you serve your term in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> like Hans Bauer ten</sentence><sentence id="1384">4 years, but the Gestapo, they decided, you know, he's too dangerous to be free so they put him in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1385">Now he was poor, that guy.</sentence><sentence id="1386">He didn't have nothing and happen when I was there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> on Cell Five some of those guys will clean up on the Gestapo there and pick up the cigarettes, you know, butts, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1387">We had plenty tobacco and we...those newcomers come and they had some cigarettes and from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> we had one guard so he bring the cigarettes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>, you know, because what you say black marketing was when going all over, so I had plenty cigarettes and I had a nice bag of tobacco, so I give...he was a heavy smoker that Hans Bower.</sentence><sentence id="1388">I give him one pack of cigarettes and he was appreciate it so much and he says what is your name.</sentence><sentence id="1389">I says Julius, because they usually call me Julius.</sentence><sentence id="1390">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1391">I remember this.</sentence><sentence id="1392">Now what it was soon after we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, but before we come to that, now then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> we go to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, the last 02:13: <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> by the name Floss (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1393">It is close to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Flossenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1394">Now there the SS with the black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span>, they was waiting for us.</sentence><sentence id="1395">And how they greet us when we step out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>...with the whips, the long whips and they call us all kind of names.</sentence><sentence id="1396">Lauese (ph), lice...and they pack us, you know, in that black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> there and shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we was standing so packed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1397">And we come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and when they open the <span class="DLF">door</span>, you couldn't see nothing when we was...and that was probably from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Floss</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> wasn't that far...was maybe three kilometer, not more than five kilometer and here they open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and we looking around.</sentence><sentence id="1398">We had not much time.</sentence><sentence id="1399">My gosh...we see the <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> and the wires and those guards there, and and right away they put us ina <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> which was few <span class="DLF">stairs</span>...I don't know...about five, six <span class="DLF">stairs</span> down.</sentence><sentence id="1400">They put us there and they push us and they hit us with the whips and that's when we take the clothes off and they give us nice cold shower.</sentence><sentence id="1401">Of course, that was summer.</sentence><sentence id="1402">That was beginning of the August, but

hours.</sentence><sentence id="1465">See that <span class="DLF">quarry</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="1466">You're going to work in that <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1467">Most of you.</sentence><sentence id="1468">Twelve hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="1469">Here is the eighth what you call commandment of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1470">I forgot how you name it, you know, but those you know, you you got to work.</sentence><sentence id="1471">You got to be good, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1472">You got to listen this and this and 02:20: this.</sentence><sentence id="1473">And if you not listen to this, for stealing, stealing bread was death sentence.</sentence><sentence id="1474">For the little thing you get twenty- five whips on your rear end.</sentence><sentence id="1475">And then he says oh yes, you can go

the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> there?</sentence><sentence id="1480">That's the way you go to freedom.</sentence><sentence id="1481">So I thought my gosh...and you look at those all wires, double wires.</sentence><sentence id="1482">You know, the first first was I don't know...three, four meter high, barbed wire and on the bottom there was a big rows you know, the barbed wire.</sentence><sentence id="1483">And the second one probably oh about thirty inches, three foot.</sentence><sentence id="1484">There was the electric wires.</sentence><sentence id="1485">Smooth electric wire, pretty close together.</sentence><sentence id="1486">Five thousand volts, so if you touch it, you burn, and I saw that too, you know, what can happen when the person start turn blue and black, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1487">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1488">Thanks God...my gosh, you know, now that's the life supposed to be so I start...somehow I start thinking now it's going to be impossible.</sentence><sentence id="1489">I got to prepare myself to commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="1490">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1491">So after fourteen days they one morning...oh, by by the way...you get up four o'clock...four thirty in the morning.</sentence><sentence id="1492">That's get up.</sentence><sentence id="1493">Aufstehen, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1494">Hear the whistle somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1495">Aufstehen somebody screamed somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="1496">Then you got to get up fast, make your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span>, take your shirts off up to here, wash yourselves and make ready and go out.</sentence><sentence id="1497">Go out by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and the block man...block man...that's the German prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1498">He was responsible for the <span class="DLF">block</span>, for the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1499">He count you.</sentence><sentence id="1500">There on the SS fuehrer, block fuehrer you called it...one of the SS take care of the...for instance, by block was number nine.</sentence><sentence id="1501">He come and the block man make a report to him, so many men go ready go to work, so many men is sick, so many die over night.</sentence><sentence id="1502">We say four, five, six men die over the night, so he make this report.</sentence><sentence id="1503">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1504">Then the <span class="BUILDING">block nine</span> was way high as</sentence><sentence id="1506">6 you go...in the middle the <span class="DLF">blocks</span> was on both sides and there was hundred two <span class="DLF">stairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1507">There was few steps and there was a level ground and there was one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the other one on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and again few steps up and two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and a few steps up, so I was pretty block nine on the right hand side was I think second or third before the last one on the right hand side, so when you looked from block nine, when you looked down to the square, to the roll call, you see everything.</sentence><sentence id="1508">You see the <span class="BUILDING">cremation building</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1509">I had a very few view from <span class="BUILDING">block nine</span>, so OK.</sentence><sentence id="1510">So after fourteen days they took us early in the morning and they bring us to the 02:24: <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1511">They give us shoes too, with the wooden sole and that's why I got the original picture because as I show here and I going to leave that picture, my picture from the first day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> hangs there today in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossunberg</span> and this is a big format of the picture, so when I was there two years ago, when I saw myself on that picture, I thought I going to faint.</sentence><sentence id="1512">My legs go down and I call my wife.</sentence><sentence id="1513">My wife was with me, my daughter, my son and I show them that, so that was something...excuse me...and I remember exactly that time when that picture was taken.</sentence><sentence id="1514">It was the first day in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and that was at noon when we get the soup.</sentence><sentence id="1515">We was waiting for the soup.</sentence><sentence id="1516">You're going to see that picture.</sentence><sentence id="1517">We are going to show later on, and there was a little SS, red hair with a big black camera like a like an accordion I should say (laughter).</sentence><sentence id="1518">And why I remember so good because we was joking from that guy.</sentence><sentence id="1519">How come they pick him up for the SS because usually when they pick up a man for the SS they got to be tall...you got to be perfect, see.</sentence><sentence id="1520">But somehow (laughter) they pick him up.</sentence><sentence id="1521">He was a little guy, red hair.</sentence><sentence id="1522">Anyway, he make that picture and I remember that day and that picture was made as I can remember as I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> on August 3rd, and fourteen days they keep us there.</sentence><sentence id="1523">It must be around August 18, 19 or maybe 20th that picture was made.</sentence><sentence id="1524">How this picture survived, how they get it, how they put it there, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1525">But I'm there see, and then on a in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> they put me in a special gang, so-called Kette Kommando.</sentence><sentence id="1526">Kette Kommando was was a gang...I can't remember...was four of us, six of us, few gangs like that...our job was going in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> way deep with a dynamite that granite night before, and those big blocks granite...we put the chain around and the big crane was on top of it.</sentence><sentence id="1527">He pick up those big blocks and bring on a level and then those blocks, they was cut again for the smaller pieces.</sentence><sentence id="1528">So I was there for few weeks and that was very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="1529">Some time the whole <span class="DLF">block</span> slipped, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1530">We didn't put the chain right, you know, somehow, and there were so many accidents there.</sentence><sentence id="1531">That was that was very danger(ous).</sentence><sentence id="1532">Now why I say this picture was made in a first day in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1533">Because on that picture I got the shoes with the wooden sole and after a while I was assigned for those Kette Kommando...put the chains on...what was so much climbing, they give me leather shoes very next day, and that's why I I remember that that was the first day in a in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1534">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1535">So after a few weeks they...for some reason one morning they put me on a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>...they take me off from this kommando.</sentence><sentence id="1536">We call it kommando...you know, the gang.</sentence><sentence id="1537">And they put me on on <span class="BUILDING">cell number 12</span> to learn how to work out and make pieces out of the granite, so my first teacher there was another prisoner, old prisoner, a Czechoslovak.</sentence><sentence id="1538">I remember his name.</sentence><sentence id="1539">Very nice man.</sentence><sentence id="1540">Franco Cerevani_ and he teach me how there do this granite.</sentence><sentence id="1541">What we was doing we was making the stone for the corpse, for the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> and for the kilometer posts, for the <span class="DLF">streets</span> those... in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you got though made out of the granite, little squares, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1542">When you see sometime those <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> made out of the granite, you know in different designs, see...those</sentence><sentence id="1544">7 kind of squares we was making and also we was making stones for the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1545">For instance, many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they're made out of granite.</sentence><sentence id="1546">Matter of fact the <span class="BUILDING">Politische Abteilung building</span> there, later on we put there.</sentence><sentence id="1547"><span class="COUNTRY">Pol</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1548">Abt.</sentence><sentence id="1549">means the all <span class="BUILDING">political bureaus</span> was there, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> commandant, wheels...they had <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> there, and matter of fact I got my probably...I can't remember exactly...four or five stones underneath the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and they're in a shape like used to call them cocquils...special made.</sentence><sentence id="1550">They stick outon the _ <span class="DLF">roof</span> and they're in a shape like half-rounded, you know, and two years ago I was there and I show my wife, my daughter and my son, look...I don't know which one but I know this is four or five of them, those stones, I make it, see.</sentence><sentence id="1551">And also we was making stones for the <span class="DLF">bridges</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1552">That time they build up the autostrada (ph)...the big way you call it...and by each <span class="DLF">bridge</span> on the side, those <span class="DLF">walls</span>, they was using those big blocks.</sentence><sentence id="1553">We...there there was a name Soldaten Steine.</sentence><sentence id="1554">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1555">That's the name was, and that's what the work was.</sentence><sentence id="1556">First few weeks that was terrible, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1557">I thought I not going to make it see.</sentence><sentence id="1558">My hand...you...that was all hand-work, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1559">Point chisel and s flat chisel, you know, &gt; , (tools in German) and mash (ph) hammer number one, number two, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1560">You smooth it up with the with the mash hammer.</sentence><sentence id="1561">So you start with number one what is rough, see, and you pound and pound and you got the brush, you know, and you brush that dust.</sentence><sentence id="1562">There was no fan, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1563">In the evening after twelve hours when we're finished, we was full white, you know, like a bakers.</sentence><sentence id="1564">Remind me in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>, you know, I wasn't that much white that time.</sentence><sentence id="1565">And then...now if you make that stone, each stone had it own term, you know...how long takes it to make.</sentence><sentence id="1566">If you make that stone on on time, you have extra bonus.</sentence><sentence id="1567">We say in a week, one mark, two mark bonus, so you can buy something in the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">They had a <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so after after a few weeks I pick up because friend of mine told me, look Julie, if you want to survive, you got to show them something what you can do and don't go down.</sentence><sentence id="1569">If you go down, you come to the stage of mussulman...what we call mussulman, mussulman...they going to kick you.</sentence><sentence id="1570">They going to kill you.</sentence><sentence id="1571">You're gonna swell up.</sentence><sentence id="1572">You going to die he said.</sentence><sentence id="1573">All the prisoners told me that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1574">So I really pay attention and thanks God by gosh, somehow I I did my work the best and I finished some of those stones most of them on time, getting better and better and I become professional stone cutter, and that's probably was one reason...as a good stone cutter, you know, as a low number...1623, those kapos they somehow somehow they they like you, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1575">They kick you any time, you know, but no respect, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1576">He's a good stone cutter.</sentence><sentence id="1577">He's got low low number, you know, so sometime they skip you.</sentence><sentence id="1578">They no kick you, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1579">But that doesn't mean (laughter) you're safe.</sentence><sentence id="1580">OK.</sentence><sentence id="1581">So you know, might want to know how what kind of a life was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1582">You hear so many stories.</sentence><sentence id="1583">What should I say?</sentence><sentence id="1584">Gosh, that was miserable.</sentence><sentence id="1585">No matter what I going to tell you, you probably...half of that you're not going to believe it because I tell you the truth.</sentence><sentence id="1586">If I think back right now, if I think, you know, it's hard for me to believe, you know, how this possible could be how I survived.</sentence><sentence id="1587">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1588">And there is so many, so many bad things happen in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1589">The life, daily life was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1590">You get up four thirty...quick, quick, quick, quick.</sentence><sentence id="1591">And go to the <span class="DLF">quarry</span>, work twelve hours, six days a week, twelve hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="1592">Sunday...Sunday before noon we do the chores, so called, you know...clean out the your <span class="INT_SPACE">lockers</span>, clean out the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, clean up yourselves and everything.</sentence><sentence id="1593">Then we had inspection, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1594">If you had button missing or something like that, you was punished for that, see.</sentence><sentence id="1595">So it was clean.</sentence><sentence id="1598">8 That time from the beginning was clean, I must say.</sentence><sentence id="1599">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1600">Oh...they cut our hair every month, and every week they cut with the clippers in the middle, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1601">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1602">And then you work 12 hours a day.</sentence><sentence id="1603">The food was not to survive no matter how strong you are for six months, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1604">The stronger people I saw, in a six months they die.</sentence><sentence id="1605">Like in the morning you get only half a liter, what you call a liter, black coffee, ersatz coffee so- called, made out of a bark, burnt bark.</sentence><sentence id="1606">Then when you was working in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span>, around nine o'clock they give you two slices of bread with margarine, as a heavy worker.</sentence><sentence id="1607">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1608">At noon, as you see on this picture what I got, we had soup.</sentence><sentence id="1609">Soup.</sentence><sentence id="1610">Cabbage, red cabbage.</sentence><sentence id="1611">I thought I never going to eat red cabbage in my life.</sentence><sentence id="1612"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spinach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1613"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spinach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1614">Spinach...I says my gosh, spinach again, and that was watered, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1615">There was no fat to it, see.</sentence><sentence id="1616">So I thought as long as I going to live I never eat spinach.</sentence><sentence id="1617">But I tell you something.</sentence><sentence id="1618">I like spinach, Once in a while (laughter) I eat spinach.</sentence><sentence id="1619">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1620">And then after you come from the work here on the roll call square, they count you again and son of a gun...you know, every day somebody was missing.</sentence><sentence id="1621">No matter what.</sentence><sentence id="1622">And they count and count and count till they find out what happen.</sentence><sentence id="1623">What would happen sometime guy die or was killed in a in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1624">Many of them was killed and they forgot to to take his name off, so they find out in a...we had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1625">We called it <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1626">They find out the guy is in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> or they find out he is on a pile there by the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>, you know, but it's happened, many times happen somebody want to try run away, and that was death sentence.</sentence><sentence id="1627">My gosh.</sentence><sentence id="1628">Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1629">Don't you try to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1630">If you try that, you...but I know, I know at least three guys..they run away and they didn't catch them.</sentence><sentence id="1631">Why they didn't catch them?</sentence><sentence id="1632">Because anybody run away, either death or life, they bring them back right in the middle in in that square.</sentence><sentence id="1633">They put them there and says look, we we caught him.</sentence><sentence id="1634">And when you people want to run away, we'll bring you back like that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1635">That's was, you 02:38: know, the lessons, you know, for for this.</sentence><sentence id="1636">So the worst...one of the guy from this _...this is very interesting...there was a Ukrainian guy.</sentence><sentence id="1637">He was smart on one hand but he wasn't so smart on the other hand.</sentence><sentence id="1638">What he did when we was working in a <span class="DLF">quarry</span>...I make the story short, we had some civilian bosses there.</sentence><sentence id="1639">Usually those guys set the dynamite there in the evening, and those civilian bosses, they had some kind of suit which you call uniform or or...there's a name for it, you know...the pants and the all together.</sentence><sentence id="1640">At noon...that's right...at noon the the boss hang out this suit in his <span class="BUILDING">shack</span>, and that Ukrainian guy sneak in and put that on and put his cap and he go ona side there there was a small <span class="DLF">gate</span>, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1641">And the guard salute to him, you know, and he let him go, and he go only about thirty kilometer.</sentence><sentence id="1642">We find out after he go about thirty kilometer and he come to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and he says, he told the farmer he just come from the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1643">He start on a <span class="BUILDING">station</span>...he don't know what <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and he want to drink the water.</sentence><sentence id="1644">He was thirsty, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> go away and he lost everything, you

everything, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1648">The farmer need a worker.</sentence><sentence id="1649">He says don't worry about that.</sentence><sentence id="1650">You know, that guy is a Gemeinde Buergermeister, he's friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="1651">I make a paper for you, so he make a paper for him, you know, and everything, even the clothes you know...was everything alright.</sentence><sentence id="1652">Now three months after...I don't know, not even three months...he was too fresh and for some reason that farmer was fresh too, and the farmer hit him and he hit
