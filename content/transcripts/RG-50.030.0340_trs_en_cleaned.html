I just want to ask you a little more about your family life before we go on to the war.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="18">What kind of business you father was in?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="19">A. My father was working.</sentence><sentence id="20">He was an insurance salesman.</sentence><sentence id="21">My grandfather had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> which made bricks and my uncles were very involved in textiles.</sentence><sentence id="22">They were fairly comfortable off, not rich, rich like a lot of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> were, but they were comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="23">Politically, I was exposed to the discussions of my aunts and uncles.</sentence><sentence id="24">I had about four or five uncles and three aunts, and they all belonged to a different political group.</sentence><sentence id="25">They were zionists.</sentence><sentence id="26">My father was a , So <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was not something he would think about or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, at that</sentence></p><p><sentence id="29">particular time.</sentence><sentence id="30">He felt we should be happy where we are and the whole idea.</sentence><sentence id="31">He was the only one of the whole lot.</sentence><sentence id="32">I had one uncle who was very hasidic.</sentence><sentence id="33">You know, had the long and the whole bit.</sentence><sentence id="34">So, I was always exposed to those discussions, even as a little girl.</sentence><sentence id="35">Not that I participated, I was not a joiner.</sentence><sentence id="36">I was not zionist, I was not a</sentence></p><p><sentence id="38">Iwas just a happy go lucky young girl with friends and <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and that's how I related to life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="39">Q. Before 1939, were you aware of Hitler and Nazism?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="40">A. I was aware of Hitler, oh, I would say "38 when the first surge of German Jews were just packed on the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community Lodz</span>, and I imagine some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else too, was very attuned to it, very charitable.</sentence><sentence id="42">So, they were trying to place those refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, open <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span>, those people were dumped on the <span class="DLF">border</span> without anything, just whatever they could carry.</sentence><sentence id="43">So, they tried to place them in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and opened <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> to feed them, and that's when I really became aware that that's what Hitler is doing.</sentence><sentence id="44">I heard about the crystal night, but I wasn't terribly into it.</sentence><sentence id="45">By end of "38, "39 I became petrified of Hitler because all of a sudden the anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, which was pretty dormant, flared up.</sentence><sentence id="46">So, we started to be called names and it became very uncomfortable and not reassuring to be a part of it.</sentence><sentence id="47">So, yes, that's when I really became aware of it, and before that I was really interested in Polish history.</sentence><sentence id="48">We were taught Polish history five times a week.</sentence><sentence id="49">Piercutsky (ph) was hey, God.</sentence><sentence id="50">When he died, I remember we had stay salute the portrait of him and tears were running down our eyes because oh, how her father almost died, which was an illusion, but I guess I was not that sophisticated at that time.</sentence><sentence id="51">So, I was aware, and the closer it came to "39 or the middle of "39 the more aware I was of it.</sentence><sentence id="52">Until the last week in August I was in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with my little sister and mother and then we had to rush back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, disguised as non-Jews to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because it</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="56">became very dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="57">By September 1, when war broke out, Hitler immediately ordered his troops, immediately overrun <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">It took two days and here they were.</sentence><sentence id="59">The Army I was so proud of, you know, the calvary with their white gloves and the beautiful <span class="DLF">pasture</span> with the horses was disengaged and here we were under Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="60">And one law after the other followed in immediate succession.</sentence><sentence id="61"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> were closed.</sentence><sentence id="62">People were dismissed from their <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">We could no longer walk on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">We had to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">We had to put yellow stars on both hands and then fires broke out everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="66">And I can still smell, almost smell the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> burning and the Germans rounding up the men on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, especially the ones with the beards and paftins, we had a lot of them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">And they had to dance around and the Germans and the Poles were just looking at it with such joy and glee that it just shattered my mind and made me a very, very frightened person.</sentence><sentence id="68">All that was going on.</sentence><sentence id="69">I stayed under German Nazi rule in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> until December of 1939, and at that time, the whole feeling was let's escape, let's go where he isn't.</sentence><sentence id="70"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided, at that time, in two parts.</sentence><sentence id="71">One part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the Russians took over and one part the Germans took over, so the idea was to escape the <span class="NPIP">part</span> where the Germans are and go to the part where <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> is.</sentence><sentence id="72">So, one night we were sitting and people were just knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and men were taken out, women were taken out.</sentence><sentence id="73">It was just a fearful, fearful situation.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="74">Q. What was going on in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>?</sentence><sentence id="75">I mean did you pretty much stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and hide out?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="76">A. They couldn't because they were rushed out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> by the Poles and Germans.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="77">They might come into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and say all Jews out.</sentence><sentence id="78">Then they would surround the men and some of them were never heard of.</sentence><sentence id="79">There were men going to work, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> of water cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and we were very easily recognizable because you had to wear a Jewish star.</sentence><sentence id="80">You could not go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy anything because it wasn't being sold to Jews, so there was a little</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="84">bit of hunger already.</sentence><sentence id="85">The predominant fact was the fear.</sentence><sentence id="86">Is my father going to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and ever come back?</sentence><sentence id="87">Am I am going to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and ever come back?</sentence><sentence id="88">Are they going to surround our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">It was the unknown of what they're going to do, but it was known that they were gong to do something.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="90">Q. Was there obvious brutality in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="91">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="92">The Hitler .</sentence><sentence id="93">We had a lot of Germans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, and the youngsters.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="94">"You there, you there, you there," you know back and forth with clubs, especially for the man it was worse than for the women.</sentence><sentence id="95">They were just using sticks, throwing stones.</sentence><sentence id="96">It was a free for all.</sentence><sentence id="97">There was no one to protect the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="98">We kind of became immediately second class people, not even citizens or a part of the community.</sentence><sentence id="99">By December we had a kind of family meeting and I just felt that I could not stay there.</sentence><sentence id="100">On other hand, the feeling was well, that's your <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">You have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over you.</sentence><sentence id="102">You just don't walk out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, not in "39.</sentence><sentence id="103">People did it later, but not in'39.</sentence><sentence id="104">So, we made a decision that father and I are going to go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the Russians.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="105">We're going to find <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, send for my mother and my little sister, and we'll establish some kind of roots away from the Germans under the Russian occupation.</sentence><sentence id="106">And that's what we did.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="107">That was middle of December "39.</sentence><sentence id="108">So, my father and I didn't look what they call the term, I didn't look Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="109">We took the stars off and we set out to go to the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="110">It wasn't a unique idea.</sentence><sentence id="111">Thousands of people had the same idea, and proceeded to go like that.</sentence><sentence id="112">Also, the Poles tried to go to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> rather than stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so you were facing <span class="DLF">moving sidewalks</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="113">People, people, people, moving with bags on their backs.</sentence><sentence id="114"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Suitcases</span>, horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span>, but it was just a moving stream of people, so we set out and our first direction was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">Now, I don't know if you're aware of how <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided.</sentence><sentence id="116">But towards that was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">So, we went in that direction, so our first stop was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">We did not have a</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="122"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> yet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> so we were living in our own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="123">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, found out that all Jews lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="124">We sneaked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and it was a horror.</sentence><sentence id="125">Dirty, hunger, they were so much worse off than we were, and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to stay or did we have a desire to stay.</sentence><sentence id="126">So, after being there two days, we sneaked out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and continued our trip to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">As we walked towards, not knowing exactly where we were going, but general directions, and since we were not unique, and there were hundreds and hundreds of people, you start talking to people.</sentence><sentence id="128">We found ourselves close to a family and they say well they are going to the <span class="REGION">Russian part</span> too, and they have a maid who lives not far from the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">They are going there and she is going to bring them over.</sentence><sentence id="130">We are free to join them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="131">Well, that was a wonderful opportunity, since we didn't know where we were going, and so we joined the group of people.</sentence><sentence id="132">Sure enough, we got to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the maid which was not far from the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="133">Q. How long had you been walking?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="134">A. Oh, maybe two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="135">Maybe a week, something like that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="136">Q. In the winter?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="137">A. Yes, well it was December.</sentence><sentence id="138">We get to the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and the maid greets them and also us with warmth and they have it all ready.</sentence><sentence id="139">They had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ready for all of us and they were going to sneak in because it was still German occupation.</sentence><sentence id="140">They were sneaking in food for us in the evening, and then the first opportunity they have that they feel the <span class="DLF">road</span> is clear, they are going to bring us over.</sentence><sentence id="141">I was observing the whole situation and it became very uncomfortable for me.</sentence><sentence id="142">I say, why does it take them so long.</sentence><sentence id="143">Something isn't right.</sentence><sentence id="144">And I was not wrong.</sentence><sentence id="145">We were there about two days and then in the middle of the night there is a knock.</sentence><sentence id="146">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we stayed on that <span class="DLF">farm</span>, rip open and here is a German patrol escorted by the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="150">maid and the rest of her family.</sentence><sentence id="151">We were in just one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, completely surrounded and the first thing was your money, your this, your that.</sentence><sentence id="152">So, father and I very quietly kind of went towards the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and as they were so busy plundering the baggage, suitcases, we sneaked out, but I had nothing but the clothes I was wearing and so did father.</sentence><sentence id="153">We just blindly headed for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">It was dark, it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="155">We had no directions.</sentence><sentence id="156">I turned around, there is no father.</sentence><sentence id="157">So, I found myself in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> not knowing quite where I am going but heading for the direction away from the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="158">I must have run all night.</sentence><sentence id="159">First I tried to find father, which was almost impossible.</sentence><sentence id="160">Well, I never did, and when daylight started I found myself on the outskirts of a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">It was cold.</sentence><sentence id="162">I was hungry.</sentence><sentence id="163">I was upset.</sentence><sentence id="164">Putting it mildly, I was desperate, when a woman approaches me and she must have sensed that I was not from that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, whatever I was.</sentence><sentence id="165">She approaches me and says why are you on the <span class="DLF">street</span> at that hour?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="166">That's not allowed.</sentence><sentence id="167">And I said, I was just attacked by the Poles and Germans and I was running.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="168">Where am I?</sentence><sentence id="169">She says, "Come with me."</sentence><sentence id="170">And she took me to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">She was a Jewish woman who went to fetch some water and took a chance to get some water when the Germans and Poles aren't out, that's why she was on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">She took me to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, her <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, if you can call it such.</sentence><sentence id="173">It was a <span class="BUILDING">one room house</span>, one room living quarters, and she had three little boys and a very pious Jews, sitting there praying and she gave me a little bit of food.</sentence><sentence id="174">Put me right next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and tried to find out from where I am, what am I doing and so on, and I told her that that's what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="175">My intent is to go over to the Russian part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">She says, well that's very hard, but I'll see what I can do for you.</sentence><sentence id="177">She evidently was -- I don't know what her position in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was, whether she was a rabbi's wife, but knew the community.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="178">She went at night, she went over and she came back and she says I'll give you a way to go over</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="182">to the Russians because I know people who do it all the time.</sentence><sentence id="183">They are smugglers.</sentence><sentence id="184">That's the trade they have.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="185">Q. Were these Jewish smugglers?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="186">A. Yes.</sentence><sentence id="187">I had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="188">I had no papers, no money, nothing literally zilch.</sentence><sentence id="189">She brought me over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">smugglers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">They looked me over for some reason they say okay, we'll take you with us.</sentence><sentence id="191">So, I was very fortunate without the help of those strangers who stretched out their hand because they felt sorry for me or I just looked different to whatever they were, I can't explain it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="192">But they were so kind.</sentence><sentence id="193">The smugglers took me with them.</sentence><sentence id="194">What they did were they were smuggling shoes, but just to assure themselves that nobody is going to grab from them what they grabbed from someone else, they first carried all left shoes, and then made the next trip with bags of right shoes and then the two bags got together and they had hundreds of pairs of shoes.</sentence><sentence id="195">But they worked with the Poles and Germans, so when they came around, the smugglers and I and the shoes went to a little where German patrol was standing and under their direction we went over to the <span class="REGION">Russian part</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="196">Q. Do you remember the names of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="197">A. I don't remember the name.</sentence><sentence id="198">At one <span class="NPIP">point</span> I did remember and I wrote it down.</sentence><sentence id="199">It's or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="200">It's a very small kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and that's how I find</sentence></p><p><sentence id="201">myself on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="202">Q. Now, being that there were all these smugglers and here you were an attractive 17, 18 year old girl, was that an advantage or did they try --?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="203">A. No, I don't think they took any advantage of me being a pretty 17 girl at all.</sentence><sentence id="204">As a matter of fact, nobody did, in all of my encounters.</sentence><sentence id="205">I found kindness in a certain -- I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="206">They kind of spoke to me differently like feeling sorry for me and that's very unusual because you feel</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="210">sorry for someone when there is one, two, three, but there were hundreds of people like me.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="211">Maybe not all alone, but so I only had kindness from them.</sentence><sentence id="212">Then they had a place on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where Poles were waiting and they collected their shoes, and then we parted company.</sentence><sentence id="213">The Poles even offered me to stay with them, and you know, you don't have to go any further, stay here.</sentence><sentence id="214">But, I wasn't trusting anyone.</sentence><sentence id="215">I took advantage of their kindness but never trusted them.</sentence><sentence id="216">So, then they went about their way and I continued.</sentence><sentence id="217">Now, I was on the Russian site, but I still had no money.</sentence><sentence id="218">I still didn't know where to go, and my recollection was that as we were still at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my uncles took the route before us, and they were mentioning the city of .</sentence><sentence id="219">So, I said I have to get to , and maybe some how, some way, I had no address or no names of people, I contact them, find them.</sentence><sentence id="220">It's not unusual to meet people on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, because everybody was walking.</sentence><sentence id="221">It took me two weeks to get to .</sentence></p><p><sentence id="222">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">I had no money for tickets so when a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving, I tried to jump on top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and get a little ride and then people were always helping me.</sentence><sentence id="224">When I did get to , it was a terrible disappointment which I could not understand it there, but I understood it a little later.</sentence><sentence id="225">Evidently, was a central <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, where all the people from the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> used to congregate.</sentence><sentence id="226">So, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was over run with so called.</sentence><sentence id="227">And they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them.</sentence><sentence id="228">They had no heart for them.</sentence><sentence id="229">So, you couldn't get a glass of water if you did not pay for it.</sentence><sentence id="230">So, I spent a few nights on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="231">Finally, somebody said there is some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> congregating in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I run there and I couldn't stay there because again, for a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> you had to pay money, and I had none.</sentence><sentence id="232">So, there was a woman who said oh, I'll tell you, I just come here for business, but I live in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> about 17 miles from , and I am sure that you can go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there because <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> are free.</sentence><sentence id="233">That's what I wanted to do.</sentence><sentence id="234">She said come with</sentence></p><p><sentence id="237">me, I'll take you there and you find out, maybe things will be easier for you.</sentence><sentence id="238">Since I had nothing to lose, I said okay.</sentence><sentence id="239">Not that I knew her before, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span> I remember clearly my journey from to .</sentence><sentence id="240">It had to be done by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">There was no other way of transportation.</sentence><sentence id="242">By then it was January, and it was very, very cold.</sentence><sentence id="243">Sled rides, the people who were running the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleds</span>, that's how they made their living, but they offered to take me without money.</sentence><sentence id="244">But, my legs were all frozen.</sentence><sentence id="245">I didn't have enough warm clothes and they were frozen for about seven, eight years until I got rid of it.</sentence><sentence id="246">Anyway, I get to that city of .</sentence><sentence id="247">She took me her <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and she says I'll introduce you to people who might help</sentence></p><p><sentence id="248">you and at that time that was the Russian part now.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="249">Q.
