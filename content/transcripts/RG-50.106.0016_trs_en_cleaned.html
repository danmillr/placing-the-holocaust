<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: Did you still see these children outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, or was it segregation in playing also?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: No, the segregation was really in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in -- in the -- even in the boy scout troop which was split up into families so-called of four or five children.</sentence><sentence id="314">The -- the Jewish kids had one or two of the families, and the rest of them were the Christian.</sentence><sentence id="315">And we played together and we were boy scouts together.</sentence><sentence id="316">And I believe I remember as a boy scout marching when Lord Baden-Powell came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">And it will be interesting to find it, whether he in fact did and did I remember it correctly, but I seem to remember a story that he told us over the megaphone that he had, I believe, scarlet fever as an adult.</sentence><sentence id="318">The reason for that was that God looked down and saw this person in short pants and said he did not have scarlet fever yet, so give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="319">11 Now, the story is basically that we did not have long pants as boy scouts.</sentence><sentence id="320">I mean, we were -- as children we had short pants.</sentence><sentence id="321">Nobody had long pants.</sentence><sentence id="322">Winter or summer we had short pants, and this was the gist of that story.</sentence><sentence id="323">Whether I read it or it's memory, it's hard to tell, but I remember parading with all the scouts from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in one of the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span>, <span class="BUILDING">soccer stadiums</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="763">Q: Was this a very frightening time for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="765">A: It was, because we were not only restricted in movement and feared really for our lives when we were out or even in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but we were also being bombed by the Americans as well as the British.</sentence><sentence id="766">So that was really the beginning of the really tough times because by that time food shortage, also death was easy to come by because of the bombings which were quite heavy.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="771">A: Usually the sirens went off and went down into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>, which were reinforced.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="772">And on May 2nd there was a particularly heavy bombing raid where -- where I was in a <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span>, was -- and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was hit fairly heavily, so we felt the earth shake and the dust and it was rather scary.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="774">23 And after the raid was over, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and found that the one half of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was also bombed.</sentence><sentence id="775">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was basically blown out.</sentence><sentence id="776">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were blown out so that we couldn't stay up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, but had to move down a few <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and moved in with a family including our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="777">And so we lived there basically until we were finally taken away, but -- so that -- and shortly after that May bombing, it became quite unsafe to be in the <span class="BUILDING">printing place</span>, so I essentially moved back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="778">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="779">Q: What was happening to your father during this time?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="780">A: My father, we didn't know -- we didn't know where he was or what was happening to him.</sentence><sentence id="781">There was no communication at that point that I can recall, not until much later.</sentence><sentence id="782">So it was strictly my mother and I trying to make a go of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="847">A: Summer of "44 was still reasonably safe.</sentence><sentence id="848">No one was deported because the Germans concentrated on the 400,000 in the <span class="REGION">provinces</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="851">Q: In the <span class="REGION">provinces</span>, right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="853">A: And so we did not see any of it.</sentence><sentence id="854">What we did see, of course, later on when they started deporting people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, but that's not until September, October.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="857">Q: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="858">So the summer went on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="861">A: The summer went on.</sentence><sentence id="862">Again, staying alive because of bombings was paramount.</sentence><sentence id="863">We spent an awful lot of time down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="864">We really --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="865">Q: What did you do when you were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="866">A: Kind of sat around in the dark and hoped that the bomb is not going to hit us.</sentence><sentence id="867">We were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">western railroad station</span>, and so we were in a prime target area.</sentence><sentence id="868">And when in May the bombing finally got our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, it was a fluke because the Americans were fairly accurate.</sentence><sentence id="869">Their system was -- is to send in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and to circle the <span class="REGION">target area</span> with smoke in the <span class="DLF">sky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="870">And the bomber stream unloaded into that circle, saturation bombing.</sentence><sentence id="871">The May that we got it but the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> didn't, the wind took that circle and we got clobbered.</sentence><sentence id="872">So the raids were pretty regular.</sentence><sentence id="873">Around 10:00 at night they started, so by 20 of 10:00 we were down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> expecting it.</sentence><sentence id="874">26 And I was working as a -- well, my doctor, my pediatrician was the head of the volunteer ambulance corps in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="875">And after my stint in the <span class="BUILDING">printing place</span>, I asked him -- I suppose I had to ask him to see if I can get trained as a first aid person.</sentence><sentence id="876">And I went through a course with adults, being the youngest to graduate from that course, and so I was a full-fledged first aid type.</sentence><sentence id="877">And as such, I did not go down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> until the bombs came awfully close.</sentence><sentence id="878">We were also fire guards.</sentence><sentence id="879">We were 15, so we didn't like the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="880">It was a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be.</sentence><sentence id="881">And so my poor mother scared out of her wits for me, but I was all over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and watching for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> to come and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">antiaircraft</span> trying to shoot them down.</sentence><sentence id="882">And when a bomb started whistling too close, then we ran down.</sentence><sentence id="883">So I really did not spend that much time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span>, ever really.</sentence><sentence id="884">I felt it was better to die up there than not.</sentence><sentence id="885">One of the things that also happened in the -- after we had to wear the yellow star, that the Vatican curia I guess made an arrangement with the Nazis, the Hungarian Nazi government, that if a Jew converted, then they would wear a different color, I think it was either white or yellow or just white armband, and they would be basically exempt from the curfew or from the deportation, from the taking them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>, labor brigades.</sentence><sentence id="886">And our superintendent's son, who was a priest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, came back to the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and was trying to convert the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="887">His name was Kuhn, K-U-H-N, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="888">And my mother and I went, took a few lessons, learned a catechism, and after awhile I refused to go back.</sentence><sentence id="889">And I remember I had the sense of abandoning one's religion under duress and that that was not right at age 15.</sentence><sentence id="890">Not being a Jew, I don't know where that came from, but that was my feeling.</sentence><sentence id="891">It's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="892">It also led to another during the Korean War, that kind of a feeling surfaced once again when I was drafted.</sentence><sentence id="893">27 But the priest ultimately became known as the hanging priest of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="894">He was -- and I think that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has a picture of him with a pistol on his cassock.</sentence><sentence id="895">And he went around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> shooting Jews.</sentence><sentence id="896">And he was hung shortly after the liberation.</sentence><sentence id="897">But it was kind ofa dichotomy that he's trying to convert but his hatred was such that he would shoot those who didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="934">A: I don't remember that.</sentence><sentence id="935">It seems that in some cases I took the lead and she deferred to me in making some decisions.</sentence><sentence id="936">One of them was a life-and-death decision.</sentence><sentence id="937">There was a suicide in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> once.</sentence><sentence id="938">Somebody jumped off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> above us and died.</sentence><sentence id="939">And I kind of remembered that.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="940">That surfaced later on.</sentence><sentence id="941">But the time period between this conversion attempt and -- which had to be maybe August, September, October, things were really getting hairy.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="942">And I remember being out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> as usual and getting caught in a bombing raid away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after the curfew, because the bombing raid didn't end, and dodging through and hoping to -- not to get stopped by the Nazis.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="943">And I'm trying to remember at what point, but it may be -- again, when we're talking about that 90-day period of September, October, November, things really get a little bit hazy, but I remember in one of the bombing raids I got caught under an arch in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and were cowering, lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="944">And the raid was over, and there was a bomb, an unexploded bomb within 20 feet of us, right in the open arch area, and we had to step over it to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="945">And of course by that time I began to see an awful lot of death and injured people and things were -- bombings were three, four times a day really.</sentence><sentence id="946">And of course the Nazis were getting worse, and so the paranoia set in quite naturally that everybody was after me, whether it was on foot or in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="947">And so things were going downhill fairly fast at that point.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="949">28</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: Were you ever stopped by any of the Nazis?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="951">A: No, Iwas not.</sentence><sentence id="952">I looked very much like a German kid.</sentence><sentence id="953">I was blond, very light blond.</sentence><sentence id="954">I also wore the school uniform coat, which was a -- an old Hungarian type uniform --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="955">Q: But you had the star on?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="956">A: -- with braids.</sentence><sentence id="957">But I had the star on.</sentence><sentence id="958">The period I'm referring to really, I took the star off and was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> without the star moving around without any papers.</sentence><sentence id="959">And of course --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="960">Q: This is September-October you're talking about?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="961">A: I would say October-November.</sentence><sentence id="962">And I don't know how I had the guts to do it or why.</sentence><sentence id="963">I just did it.</sentence><sentence id="964">And I moved because I didn't like restriction.</sentence><sentence id="965">And it pretty much had to be that period, although I was doing that out of the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish house</span> also for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="966">But at any rate, I moved around.</sentence><sentence id="967">The danger, of course, was -- is that if you were stopped, you had no papers, pulled your pants down and if you were circumcised, they killed you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
