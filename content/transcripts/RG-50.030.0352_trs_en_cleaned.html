glasses, you know.</sentence><sentence id="900">So that thought left such an impression on me.</sentence><sentence id="901">And the other big impression was when we were taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="902">We were taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, and if you can imagine a <span class="DLF">fence</span> that is made out of wooden slats that are very tightly attached to each other.</sentence><sentence id="903">We were walking by this <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and people were screaming.</sentence><sentence id="904">And I remember asking my mother, "Why are they screaming?"</sentence><sentence id="905">My mother said to me, "Because they recognize names that were written on the <span class="DLF">fence</span>."</sentence><sentence id="906">Now, nobody</sentence><sentence id="908">7 had pens or pencils with them, but people bent down and picked up a piece of rock or chalky substance that was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>.</sentence><sentence id="909">And they smeared their names in the <span class="DLF">fence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="910">Or wrote down dates when they were there, in case somebody else will come and recognize them.</sentence><sentence id="911">It's that feeling or maybe that faith that knowing that you may be going to your death, that maybe somebody else will come and recognize your name.</sentence><sentence id="912">Because the entire <span class="DLF">fence</span> was scribbled with names, and people obviously recognized some names on those <span class="DLF">fences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="913">Or they didn't recognize, maybe they thought they did.</sentence><sentence id="914">You never know what went on in people's minds, but the fear was tremendous.</sentence><sentence id="915">And we were taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> where everybody had to get undressed.</sentence><sentence id="916">And I remember the horror for the first time in my life, that I have seen adults naked.</sentence><sentence id="917">I didn't even see children naked.</sentence><sentence id="918">I don't remember if I saw myself naked.</sentence><sentence id="919">I was just a little girl, and now I see children and mothers and grandmothers marching around naked into these <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="920">And people were screaming because they obviously did not think that those were showered.</sentence><sentence id="921">Obviously felt that this is the end of them, but we were showered.</sentence><sentence id="922">And we came out of it, which is so unbelievable that -- that that impression, that horrendous thing, it stays like a picture in your mind forever.</sentence><sentence id="923">And then we were taken back.</sentence><sentence id="924">And the other, of course, the counting that I already told you about, that they marched us out from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> constantly to stand in <span class="DLF">lines</span> and count us, stand in rows.</sentence><sentence id="925">And the other horrendous impression was when they came with their leather boots and the German Shepherds with them.</sentence><sentence id="926">And bringing the food, which always looked to me like some kind of a dishwater with something floating in it that looked like some burgundy sausage or something.</sentence><sentence id="927">Something disgusting looking in it.</sentence><sentence id="928">That was the food, and a little bit of bread.</sentence><sentence id="929">I don't know, I really honestly I don't know how we survived.</sentence><sentence id="930">I really do not know how we survived.</sentence><sentence id="931">How we survived the hunger, how we survived the conditions.</sentence><sentence id="932">It's like it's hard, it's amazing.</sentence><sentence id="933">I remember also being marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.763369" long="9.895119">Bergen-Belsen</span> about eight months after being there.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1199">A: I don't recall the ride.</sentence><sentence id="1200">What I do remember is arriving to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that looked like a <span

class="NPIP">dream</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And I remember coming there, and the children were given toys by the Red Cross and being fed and being taken care of.</sentence><sentence id="1203">And the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="DLF">Hotel Esplanade</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1204">And very shortly after arriving and probably being checked physically and medically and checking for lice and checking to see if everybody who needs medical attention and so forth, very shortly afterwards, they took all the children away.</sentence><sentence id="1205">And we were brought to a -- up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span>, you know, like into like a farm area for recuperation.</sentence><sentence id="1206">And just to get us a little bit healthier after all the ordeal of being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for so long.</sentence><sentence id="1207">At this point the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span> was there to help.</sentence><sentence id="1208">The Schlakim (ph) , which are messengers from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at the time came to our aid.</sentence><sentence id="1209">They were working very hard on receiving the proper certificates to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, because we could not enter freely.</sentence><sentence id="1210">And some semblance of normal life wanted to return.</sentence><sentence id="1211">Now, that's what they wanted to achieve.</sentence><sentence id="1212">So they took us into a -- as I said, it was probably like a <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1213">Almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> kind of a thing on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1214">And they started process, they started to try to teach us according to the level that we were at, what we were supposed to start.</sentence><sentence id="1215">And I don't even remember -- probably they tried to teach us in Hungarian, if I'm not wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1218">2 Now, in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> we all learned a little bit of German because that was the spoken language in that area of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1219">And each and one of us kind of picked up some German language.</sentence><sentence id="1220">I remember sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>, it was very frightening to me to some extent because here I was away from my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1221">My mother was left in this big <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with a lot of other women who were widowed, and all the children in all ages were gathered together.</sentence><sentence id="1222">And teachers were brought from all <span class="NPIP">over</span> to try to teach us, and they tried to conduct classes.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And I just remember me sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and totally gazing and not comprehending anything.</sentence><sentence id="1224">It was like in a <span class="NPIP">dream</span>, I remember sitting there saying to myself that "This is <span class="BUILDING">school</span>," but my mind was totally on other things.</sentence><sentence id="1225">I could not concentrate.</sentence><sentence id="1226">I don't remember that -- I can't recall if I learned anything.</sentence><sentence id="1227">I probably remember just learning just a little bit of the ABCs, the lettering, the beginning of learning how to read.</sentence><sentence id="1228">But to tell you that this was a formal schooling that I could recall or I can retain anything, probably very little because of the emotional upheaval that probably I felt as a child.</sentence><sentence id="1229">The one thing for sure that none of us got was psychological counseling.</sentence><sentence id="1230">That was not in anybody's agenda or even in their -- in anybody's thought that that was needed at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1231">I remember the older children putting up a play of David and Goliath.</sentence><sentence id="1232">I remember my brother playing the role of Goliath if I'm -- of David.</sentence><sentence id="1233">And -- but I don't remember anything else from <span class="REGION">area</span>, just the fact that there was a lot of cheese, which I hated.</sentence><sentence id="1234">There was a lot of milk, which I didn't like to drink.</sentence><sentence id="1235">Most people were so happy so see cheese.</sentence><sentence id="1236">As a child, these were things that I did not like to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1237">I did not like cheese, and I didn't like hard-boiled eggs, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1238">I used to choke on them.</sentence><sentence id="1239">There are memories of things that I really could not -- I guess I could not tolerate them.</sentence><sentence id="1240">And other than that, really the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> passed by, and before we knew it -- I also remember something that really stayed with me, is the fact that the Swiss people did not look upon us kindly.</sentence><sentence id="1241">They were not friendly.</sentence><sentence id="1242">They really did not like foreigners, and they -- I'm sure that this</sentence><sentence id="1244">3 was very hard for them to get this many refugees in one of their <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1245">And from there we were taken away.</sentence><sentence id="1246">I don't know what mode of transportation, in all honesty.</sentence><sentence id="1247">Probably by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> we were taken by a <span

teaching <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2351">That wasn't enough.</sentence><sentence id="2352">So Simon started seriously studying for his SATs, and trying to learn by himself how to do -- how to take the tests and how to score.</sentence><sentence id="2353">And a year later, we felt that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schenectady</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is too isolated a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="2354">This is just not -- wasn't the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> for two young people.</sentence><sentence id="2355">We were very, very lonely and alone there.</sentence><sentence id="2356">And after spending another summer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span>, we got a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Quincy</span>, <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span>, which is south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>, 15 miles south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2357">And we went to teach there in a very lovely congregation, and Simon applied to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">BU</span> and was accepted as an engineering student.</sentence><sentence id="2358">And so our life was set.</sentence><sentence id="2359">We both worked full-time as <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> teachers, and Simon went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2360">And he graduated within four years, aeronautical engineering.</sentence><sentence id="2361">Then once that was done, we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2362">At this stage of our lives in 1964, we were married about seven years or so, and we really -- already beforehand we really wanted to have children, start a family.</sentence><sentence id="2363">I couldn't have any children.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And so as a result, we started to look into adoption which was impossible.</sentence><sentence id="2365">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> they had the blue laws.</sentence><sentence id="2366">Only Jewish children can a Jewish couple adopt, and you could not adopt a child out of your faith.</sentence><sentence id="2367">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, we applied again for adoption.</sentence><sentence id="2368">The situation was very similar in those days and very, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2369">So Simon worked for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Grumman Aircraft</span> for two years, and I went back -- I left the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> teaching, which was a good job and wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="2370">But I really desired a more creative job, and I wanted to design dresses.</sentence><sentence id="2371">Just really what.</sentence><sentence id="2372">I learned, and I was a dress designer for a <span class="BUILDING">children's manufacturer</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2373">When we realized that we will never be able to adopt a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, two years later Simon looked for a job in <span class="REGION">California</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2374">Everybody told us that it's much easier to adopt children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, and that's the place for us to go.</sentence><sentence id="2375">And so we took off, literally took off.</sentence><sentence id="2376">Simon got a job through the</sentence><sentence id="2378">3 <span class="BUILDING">Wall Street Journal</span> with <span class="BUILDING">Litten Industries</span>, and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, total strangers again.</sentence><sentence id="2379">The wandering Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2380">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>, we did not know a soul.</sentence><sentence id="2381">I think we were in <span class="BUILDING">motel</span> when we applied for adoption through the Los Angeles County of Adoption Agency.</sentence><sentence id="2382">And we started working: Simon at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Litten</span>; me as a dress designer.</sentence><sentence id="2383">Worked very hard, the two of us, to make end meet.</sentence><sentence id="2384">And nine months later we got our son, our first child.</sentence><sentence id="2385">And we named him Terrence, a nice Irish name.</sentence><sentence id="2386">And we gave him a Hebrew name, Alonim (ph) , which is an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oak tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2387">Nice and strong.</sentence><sentence id="2388">And actually we call him Terry or Alonim, depending on what the mood is.</sentence><sentence id="2389">And today he's 28 years old, he's married.</sentence><sentence id="2390">He lives up in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> with his wife.</sentence><sentence id="2391">And he has no children, and I don't think he desires to have any.</sentence><sentence id="2392">Later on, we adopted a little girl, and we named her Corey Tamar, but actually she's called Tammy.</sentence><sentence id="2393">So she's not using any of formal names.</sentence><sentence id="2394">Everybody calls her Tammy, and she's 24 years old.</sentence><sentence id="2395">And she's engaged to be married, and she's finishing her Master's Degree in social work at <span class="BUILDING">Boston University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2396">And a year from now in October, she'll get married to a wonderful young man who is at <span class="BUILDING">Yale Law School</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2397">And the two children really -- the two children with us formed our little family.</sentence><sentence id="2398">And we raised them in <span class="REGION">California</span> partially, and then Simon got a very good job over here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and we moved.</sentence><sentence id="2399">Terry was four and a half years old, and Tammy was seven months old.</sentence><sentence id="2400">And we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2401">So I arrived with two little kids in a brand new <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2402">Again, not knowing almost anyone.</sentence><sentence id="2403">But before long, you know, we made friends, and we realized really that it doesn't matter where you live.</sentence><sentence id="2404">It's the friends that you make in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that counts.</sentence><sentence id="2405">Every strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> is strange at first until you make some friends.</sentence><sentence id="2406">And now we have so many friends, we don't have time for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2407">And we live out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potomac</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2575">A: I didn't go too much into the culture.</sentence><sentence id="2576">I just was overwhelmed, for instance, surprised.</sentence><sentence id="2577">We arrived to Simon's uncle, who was from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and his wife was also from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2578">We arrived</sentence><sentence id="2580">5 and they were eating and watching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2581">I found it terribly rude.</sentence><sentence id="2582">You know, I couldn't understand this.</sentence><sentence id="2583">I could not comprehend this.</sentence><sentence id="2584">Because, first of all, when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they didn't have television so that's one detail.</sentence><sentence id="2585">But second, when guests or somebody -- stranger came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, then you sat and you talked to them around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2586">You didn't look at television.</sentence><sentence id="2587">I mean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and everything, everything was a bit overwhelming at first.</sentence><sentence id="2588">But in our own modest way, you know, we scaled things down.</sentence><sentence id="2589">We knew how to look inward and to know what we could afford and what we cannot afford.</sentence><sentence id="2590">I mean it wasn't that difficult for me to say -- we were not needy as much.</sentence><sentence id="2591">You know, we could easily say, "Well, we're not going to buy another skirt or another pair of pants or another shirt, because we just can't afford it this year.</sentence><sentence id="2592">It's okay, we'll do it next year."</sentence><sentence id="2593">And it next year came and we couldn't afford it, we'll say, "Well, that's okay, we'll do it the following year."</sentence><sentence id="2594">But both of us were very grounded, and we had very strong priorities.</sentence><sentence id="2595">We knew where it's at, we knew we had a goal.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Once we decided that we have a goal and Simon has to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we are going to make it, not matter what, we always looked at the right things.</sentence><sentence id="2597">And to be very honest with you, we have many friends who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and most of them got some help from <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2598">We really did it on our own.</sentence><sentence id="2599">Our parents could not afford to help us.</sentence><sentence id="2600">We helped our parents, we used to send money <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="2601">Especially Simon's parents, because his father was ill, and he could no longer work.</sentence><sentence id="2602">Looking back then, we didn't think it was not fair.</sentence><sentence id="2603">We did not think that it is overwhelming -- we didn't think we were that unusual.</sentence><sentence id="2604">We really took it that this is fine, and everything that we did we felt, well, this is a step -- just a little step better than what we had before.</sentence><sentence id="2605">Every little success or every little achievement that we achieved, it was great.</sentence><sentence id="2606">Both of us are very optimistic people, and we really always felt that our cup is more than half full.</sentence></p></dialogue>
