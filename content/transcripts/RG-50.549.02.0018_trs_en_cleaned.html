<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Does anything particular come to mind?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="201">A: N -- Only the one thing that was really not correct that somehow in my -- although I think my English is pretty good, so once in awhile I express myself a little awkwardly and I think something didn't quite come across.</sentence><sentence id="202">You see, when the war started, I was li -- I was 19 years old, but the year before, really, we -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> was happening and we were very worried, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.580032" long="7.749989">Strasbourg</span> is the most exposed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">And so my parents asked me to take my grandmother away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.580032" long="7.749989">Strasbourg</span> and in transcript -- in -- I -- I read that I took my -- I went to safety with my grandmother and the interpretation was that I went to be safe with my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="204">What really</sentence><sentence id="206">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 9 happened is that I took responsibility for my grandmother and I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I went to some kind of <span class="BUILDING">resort</span>, to wait until things were settling down in -- in the whole world situation and then brought my grandmother back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strassber</span> -- the following year, when the war really was going to get started, same thing happened.</sentence><sentence id="207">I was away, my father brought me back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">This is end of August, 1939 and again I took my grandmother, we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="209">We went to the center of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> where we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and I took my grandmother to safety, I didn't go to safety with my grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="210">So, this is one of the things that, as I say, I took responsibility for my grandmother and we waited out [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="211">And so this is one of the detail that are -- other things, they don't come to my mind right now.

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: Okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: So that's the information I can gi-give you about my parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: Tell me -- tell me a little bit about -- about your fe -- your family, in regard to the - - the climate in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, about the way things were done in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, about the religion, about the ethics.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="232">A: Well, we were very observant family.</sentence><sentence id="233">My mother came, obviously, from a very observant family.</sentence><sentence id="234">Both my parents came, but my mother -- of the two -- of my parents, my mother was the more knowledgeable.</sentence><sentence id="235">She -- really amazingly, for a woman in those days, could understand the prayer book, could understand the</sentence></p><p><sentence id="238">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 10 Biblical text.</sentence><sentence id="239">My father could read -- with a lot of mistakes -- he could lead a service even, but he made lot of mistakes, because he didn't have the intellectual stuff that goes with it.</sentence><sentence id="240">He had just learned it by rote and by heart and so on.</sentence><sentence id="241">But the climate was one of observance.</sentence><sentence id="242"><span class="COUNTRY">Judaism</span> was certainly central to our lives.</sentence><sentence id="243">There was not an intellectual climate.</sentence><sentence id="244">There was not a interest in music, in books.</sentence><sentence id="245">My parents read, but probably -- well, I don't know what you'd call them har -- here.</sentence><sentence id="246">Romantic stuff that -</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: What -- what language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Oh, at -- at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we spoke Alsatian, which is a dialect, based on German and my mother spoke French, obviously I spoke French and went to <span class="BUILDING">French school</span> and in my teenage, rebellious years, I pretended I couldn't understand anything but French, which my father didn't speak.</sentence><sentence id="249">Don't forget, that <span class="REGION">Alsace</span> moved back and forth between <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which meant that my grandmother, who lived with us, was born in the French period, to -- became German in 1871, when <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> lost the Prussian war.</sentence><sentence id="250">So both my parents were born under a German regime and went to <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">Spoke German fluently.</sentence><sentence id="252">In 1918, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> reverted to fran -- Al- Alsace reverted to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">Now, my mother came from a very Francophile, somewhat more educated family and all the daughters were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, at least for some time, to be with an aunt, whom I know -- whom I knew too, and there they perfected their French.</sentence><sentence id="254">So my mother spoke and wrote perfect French.</sentence><sentence id="255">No spelling</sentence></p><p><sentence id="258">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 11 mistake, no nothing, she didn't -- but she also could do it in German.</sentence><sentence id="259">My father -- whose business was with the peasants, the farmers, the -- the rural community, never bothered to learn French.</sentence><sentence id="260">So he could understand somewhat.</sentence><sentence id="261">So as I said, in my rebellious teenage years, when he and I collided, I couldn't understand Alsatian.</sentence><sentence id="262">I should like to add something that -- very pa -- I don't know how interesting it is to this particular interview, but Alsatian Jews speak not -- sp-speak what is called in French, le Judeo Alsatian, or in their own parlance, they call it Yiddish dige.</sentence><sentence id="263">It's not Yiddish, because God forbid an Alsatian Jew should speak Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="264">The Alsatian Jews look down on eastern European Jews, whom they all called Polacks, that's -- was the n-nomination, so just like the German Jews in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> look down on the immigrants that came after them from the <span class="REGION">eastern European countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">Exactly the same situation.</sentence><sentence id="266">My father is probably turning around in his <span class="DLF">grave</span>, as I have discovered that this Judeo Alsatian, which they spoke, is really similar to Yiddish.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="267">It's not -- does not have -- it's -- doesn't have a written language, it doesn't have a literature.</sentence><sentence id="268">It was just a spoken language -- is dying out, but it's being retrieved and I happen -- I -- where as when I grew up, I thought of it as very crude and very common and I walked two miles behind my parents when they spoke it.</sentence><sentence id="269">Today, I'm very interested in it and I have read a number of books.</sentence><sentence id="270">There -- I find out there is -- I have been communicating with people who are studying it and there is very few of us who still ha-have a feel for it.</sentence><sentence id="271">It's a very rich language, very different from Yiddish</sentence></p><p><sentence id="274">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0018 12 in it's pronunciation and it's formation of words, and is very much tied into Hebrew, which also intrigues me very much.</sentence><sentence id="275">So, this is how that beca --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Can -- can you give us a short example of how it sounds?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="277">A: Yes, I can give you one that I always use when people ask me.</sentence><sentence id="278">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you say, "Eashe harbor gie gessen."</sentence><sentence id="279">I have eaten.</sentence><sentence id="280">In Yiddish, you say, "Ay chobe gessen."</sentence><sentence id="281">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsatian</span>, you say, "Shop gessa."</sentence><sentence id="282">In Yiddish dige, le Judeo Alsatian, "Ishap ger archult."</sentence><sentence id="283">I don't if you know Hebrew, but ochell in Hebrew is to eat.</sentence><sentence id="284">So they -- they use the Hebrew word, they conjugate it in germaway and they say, Ishap.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="285">The big difference, eehope and ishap, that's the big different.</sentence><sentence id="286">Ishap ger archult and that's the way my father would speak, using Hebrew words, conjugating them and distorting them, so that in order to trace back what it really means, you really have to do a little research.</sentence><sentence id="287">And it's -- has intrigued enough people.</sentence><sentence id="288">There is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> of Judeo Alsatian [indecipherable] at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="289">And it's a non-Jewish person who is studying it.</sentence><sentence id="290">So it's interesting [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="291">But anyway, this is what we spoke at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">And coming back to this, the atmosphere, you know, my parents had no social life.</sentence><sentence id="293">They didn't go out, they didn't travel.</sentence><sentence id="294">My vacations were -- m-my grandparents <span
