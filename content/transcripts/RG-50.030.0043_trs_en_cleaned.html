<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: And where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="10">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, uh May 30th, 1922.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="12">Q: Could you tell me something about your family, and growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I was very fortunate because we lived with my grandmother and grandfather in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">I was the only child.</sentence><sentence id="16">My mother had a child a year before me, but he died just before delivery.</sentence><sentence id="17">So I was the first grandchild in the family.</sentence><sentence id="18">And I...all my first memories are about my grandfather, and I feel very warmly about him.</sentence><sentence id="19">He died when L...three months before my third birthday.</sentence><sentence id="20">But nevertheless, all my memories are about my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="21">And we simply had a love affair.</sentence><sentence id="22">Uh he would watch me to go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> to buy his cigars.</sentence><sentence id="23">His cigars were "Virginki," which means that they were tobacco from <span class="COUNTRY">Virginia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">Uh we called them "Virginki."</sentence><sentence id="25">And he watched me to cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> and give my little money on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span>, and bring him uh his cigars.</sentence><sentence id="26">And he very proudly looked after me, that I was able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="27">So at the very early childhood, he really pushed me to independence, to do things for myself.</sentence><sentence id="28">I remember he had a little wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> with a crack in it.</sentence><sentence id="29">And I loved peanuts, but I was very small to crack them.</sentence><sentence id="30">So I put the peanuts in that little crack, and he gave me a mallet; and I would push the peanuts and I could have to open it myself.</sentence><sentence id="31">And these are memories that nobody could have really told me that uh about my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="32">Or we went walking; and uh I even remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where we went.</sentence><sentence id="33">And he would give me a little coin; and I would go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and give my little penny on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span>, and uh--whatever it was--and buy, you know, a little piece of candy.</sentence><sentence id="34">And he waited for me <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">And uh his birthday was in March, and he died just shortly afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="36">And I came to him to give him my little poem.</sentence><sentence id="37">I had to learn little tiny poems for the family, for the members of the family.</sentence><sentence id="38">That was my gift for their birthdays--to learn a poem.</sentence><sentence id="39">And I went to tell it to him, and he already didn't respond.</sentence><sentence id="40">I think he had a stroke.</sentence><sentence id="41">And I came out crying, because my grandmother...uh my grandfather didn't kiss me and he didn't say, "Thank you."</sentence><sentence id="42">That I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="43">That I was told.</sentence><sentence id="44">It's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="45">I don't remember the kind of a rejection, which I thought at that time.</sentence><sentence id="46">That I only remember loving things about him.</sentence><sentence id="47">And my grandmother was with us all my growing up.</sentence><sentence id="48">She had her birthday five days before mine; so we celebrated, more or less, birthday together.</sentence><sentence id="49">She always kept a piece of her cake for me.</sentence><sentence id="50">She was the one who told me stories.</sentence><sentence id="51">Uh I would crawl into her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and she would tell me a fairy tale I had heard about fifty-five times; but I wanted to hear it for the fifty-sixth time from her.</sentence><sentence id="52">Uh when I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, she would cross the big <span class="DLF">street</span> to help me cross back again.</sentence><sentence id="53">And I was more concerned about her <span class="DLF">crossing</span> safely, but she was concerned my <span class="DLF">crossing</span> safely.</sentence><sentence id="54">So it got a little complicated there.</sentence><sentence id="55">But she was in many ways the mother on whom I patterned my life.</sentence><sentence id="56">And she had in her...she had a very orderly <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span>, she had a bag with her white shroud; and she knew according to the Jewish religion this is how she would want to be buried, and wanted to be buried with my grandfather in the same <span class="DLF">grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">She never had a chance to use that shroud even though we sent it with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> [Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>].</sentence><sentence id="59">But I knew that["s] what she wanted.</sentence><sentence id="60">Uh that was a sort of a thing to do every Sunday morning.</sentence><sentence id="61">We would go to <span class="DLF">Grandfather's grave</span>, and we'd put little stones.</sentence><sentence id="62">That's a tradition--you put a little stone.</sentence><sentence id="63">And if she was not able to go, I always put a little stone for her on my grandfather's <span class="DLF">grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">And uh after the...after I returned I always...when I'm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> go, and go to my grandfather's <span class="DLF">grave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="65">And since we were not able to put her there, we had her...1 had her name put on the same gravestone.</sentence><sentence id="66">And my relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> are maintaining the <span class="DLF">grave</span>, even though many...even though so many are neglected.</sentence><sentence id="67">And uh so she is there, at least in memoriam, as she wished to be.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="123">Q: What, as you grew up, as you became a young woman, what was your schooling like?</sentence><sentence id="124">What were your friends like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: For the first five years I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="128">It was more <span class="BUILDING">Zionistic Jewish school</span>, not a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">We were twenty boys and ten girls.</sentence><sentence id="130">Out of the ten girls, we were five Hannas--because it was a very popular name.</sentence><sentence id="131">And out of the five girls, as far as...as far I can say, I'm the only one who survived.</sentence><sentence id="132">Out of the twenty boys, I know about five survived.</sentence><sentence id="133">I am in contact with one of them; and just recently, he sent me a picture of the second and the fourth grade, which was a real find for me.</sentence><sentence id="134">After that, I went to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>--which was the academic level.</sentence><sentence id="135">And uh then I went into a <span class="BUILDING">business school</span>, and I started working and be very... I was always very, very independent, very, very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="136">And my father led me to independence.</sentence><sentence id="137">Uh, I--as an eleven, twelve year old, I went to collect from his...from the builders money, so he would have for his payroll.</sentence><sentence id="138">And in the beginning they looked at this little girl who's coming to collect money, and would call my father: "Is that on the level?"</sentence><sentence id="139">And he said, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="140">And I gave them a receipt, signed it.</sentence><sentence id="141">He told them it's OK, because nobody had an idea that I was bringing payroll money.</sentence><sentence id="142">So he was leading me, again, pretty much to independence.</sentence><sentence id="143">Because my mother was uh a rather sickly woman who had frequent pneumonias, who have had at least uh five, six miscarriages after me.</sentence><sentence id="144">I was the only live birth uh child.</sentence><sentence id="145">So I was uh uh freely very much led to independence, almost compensating for her; because she was really very shy, very sickly and had enormously uh uh heavy thick glasses because she was so near-sighted.</sentence><sentence id="146">Uh I was...my character was much more like my aunt--my mother's sister--and my father, who was much more outgoing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: As you grew older, um you began to become involved with the young men?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Uh I was...uh I was fortunate in my age we were still able to have some social life and go to <span class="BUILDING">dancing schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">It's all, you know, with the long dress and uh formalities.</sentence><sentence id="171">I was still about the last year that["s] where we were able to do it.</sentence><sentence id="172">And at that time, I was going with uh a student who was three years my age--so I was about sixteen, he was nineteen--by the name of Rudolph Schiff.</sentence><sentence id="173">We called him "Rudla."</sentence><sentence id="174">And uh when I was seventeen, and uh the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were closing on us uh and uh...things were starting really getting bad, we got married November 14th, 1939, at the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">Again, there was no <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="176">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">He went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the evening, because there was no possibility.</sentence><sentence id="178">In his uh...his families lived a couple of blocks away from us, so that was no big problem.</sentence><sentence id="179">And uh as uh the Germans were closing in, we had to go into more and more cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="180">And his parents had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> what had it sub-divided.</sentence><sentence id="181">And each <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was given to another family.</sentence><sentence id="182">And uh the uh...so there was really no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="183">Then one of the families were sent with transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, so for couple of months we had one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">In the meantime, he got scarlet fever.</sentence><sentence id="185">And at that time, when you had scarlet fever uh you had to go for six weeks into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="186">Today, somebody with scarlet fever--it's [like] a strep throat.</sentence><sentence id="187">A couple of days, and you are fine.</sentence><sentence id="188">They thought that you were infectious for six weeks, until your started to peel.</sentence><sentence id="189">I had scarlet fever when I was in the first grade, so I knew what it meant for six weeks to be in isolation--which I was.</sentence><sentence id="190">By the way, I was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">isolation</span> at children["s] hospital; and the children["s] hospital was run by nuns.</sentence><sentence id="191">And the nuns said...came to us and uh said, "OK, children, get off your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>, kneel and pray."</sentence><sentence id="192">And I said to the nun, "I'm sorry, I'm Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="193">I don't kneel."</sentence><sentence id="194">And so she said, "What are you going to do?"</sentence><sentence id="195">I said, "I'm going to pray in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> the way my grandmother taught me."</sentence><sentence id="196">And that was that.</sentence><sentence id="197">I did not follow the party line, and in many ways the nuns respected that.</sentence><sentence id="198">I was only seven--barely seven at that time, because I had my birthday in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">And uh so he had scarlet fever.</sentence><sentence id="200">He had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>; and while he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, they brought in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> a little four year old--little Frankie.</sentence><sentence id="201">Cute little Frankie.</sentence><sentence id="202">The parents were Polish uh emigres who came to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>; and while he was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, they had to go with a transport and leaving the child in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">They didn't allow them to wait until he was discharged.</sentence><sentence id="204">So my sister-in-law--my husband's sister, Margit--uh sort of adopted him and uh was to take him.</sentence><sentence id="205">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, and while he was there she took care of him.</sentence><sentence id="206">But, of course, when she came with him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, she went to gas with him.</sentence><sentence id="207">But when he...we had really difficulty during that time of all kinds.</sentence><sentence id="208">Uh during that time things were getting worse in terms of uh getting supplies, buying food, working, going places.</sentence><sentence id="209">I remember going on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and meeting one of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends.</sentence><sentence id="210">Of course, by that time I had the star; and as we came closer to each other, we walked slower and slower, thinking, "Should I stop?</sentence><sentence id="211">Should I talk?</sentence><sentence id="212">Who was it worse for, her?</sentence><sentence id="213">Is it worse for me?</sentence><sentence id="214">What should we go and do?"</sentence><sentence id="215">So... And so we slowly came together, looked at each other, winked at each other, and passed again.</sentence><sentence id="216">It...it was that sort of a situation.</sentence><sentence id="217">You had to think, "Wait a minute.</sentence><sentence id="218">Is today Saturday?</sentence><sentence id="219">Saturday, I cannot go this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">Friday, I cannot get that <span class="NPIP">place</span>."</sentence><sentence id="221">Because the restrictions were getting tighter and tighter.</sentence><sentence id="222">So it was a difficult time under any circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="223">Uh, now Rudie--my husband--had a brother, Karel Schiff, who was finishing his MD degree.</sentence><sentence id="224">By that time, Hitler came.</sentence><sentence id="225">And there were only two Jewish uh people who were supposed to get their degree.</sentence><sentence id="226">You know, that big day in Europe--it was a much bigger day to get your degree.</sentence><sentence id="227">Uh they gave the degree to everybody; and they took the two Jewish fellows to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, and gave them their diploma in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">And uh he had, as I said, a sister and a brother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="229">None of them have returned.</sentence><sentence id="230">Uh, my father-in-law died in the transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">He died uh on the way.</sentence><sentence id="232">And my mother-in- law, was a very energetic woman, and brother-in-law were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">familienlager</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span>].</sentence><sentence id="233">And I was told how uh they knew what was going to happen to them.</sentence><sentence id="234">Uh, Rudla was with them; and uh I understood he was quite sick.</sentence><sentence id="235">And uh he died probably before he went to gas--in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">familienlager</span>, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="305">Q: Let's go back a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="306">Can you tell us a little more about the early years, of the German invasion, what that meant?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: Uh, I remember the day they came.</sentence><sentence id="310">I remember the day I sto...1 remember the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the <span class="DLF">street</span> where I stood, and it was snowing.</sentence><sentence id="311">It was a cold day and they were pulling in - I was by myself.</sentence><sentence id="312">I just walked there.</sentence><sentence id="313">It was not far, maybe three-quarters of a mile from where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="314">And we were uh uh watching them on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>, with their half- tracks, with guns pointing to the <span class="DLF">rooftops</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">And it was snowing.</sentence><sentence id="316">And we knew that the screw is going to become tighter and tighter.</sentence><sentence id="317">Uh we knew what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="318">But somehow we still had some foolish idea we are in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="319">Because, I remember so clearly, when I was about eleven or twelve, I read a book about the Marranos.</sentence><sentence id="320">These were the uh Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> who during the Inquisition had a choice either to give up their religion or be uh converted [to] Catholicism; and many of them became converted only in name, and still celebrated secretly all the Jewish holidays.</sentence><sentence id="321">And uh this was a very interesting story about the Inquisitor, etc.</sentence><sentence id="322">And I remember--you know, the kind of vignettes one remembers from childhood--I remember telling my grandmother, "Aren't we fortunate that we live in the 20th century in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span>, that such a thing cannot happen to us!"</sentence><sentence id="323">Six short years, six short years [later, it] happened to us.</sentence><sentence id="324">Not only as to them, but much worse.</sentence><sentence id="325">Uh, kind of took away from us the protection that it happens to somebody else but not to us.</sentence><sentence id="326">One becomes and realizes how vulnerable one is.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: When did things begin to change--for your family, in particular?</sentence><sentence id="346">How did you... Describe some of it. .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="349">A: Uh, I worked at that time what they used to call a Palestina Amt [Ger: Palestine Office].Uh, at that time there were still people able to move, uh emigrate.</sentence><sentence id="350">And of course, when you signed your paper for emigration, if I was Hanna Schiff at that time, I had to sign it as "Hanna Sarah Schiff."</sentence><sentence id="351">All the women had to put down "Sarah," and all the men had to put in "<span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>" as a mid...as a middle name.</sentence><sentence id="352">And I was go...going to the Department of Treasury where I filled up some papers, and uh they had to pay that much of a... They had to give a list of all their property they were going to take with us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">suitcases</span>, and they had to pay that much for this and that much for that.</sentence><sentence id="353">And so I was working on that.</sentence><sentence id="354">And therefore, I knew that the Jacob Edelstein was the head of the Palestina Amt, and knew some people there--which later became very important to me.</sentence><sentence id="355">Uh the... (pause) I worked during the time, but I cannot...
