<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="145">Q: Can you describe the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="147">A: The life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I can better describe than other things.</sentence><sentence id="148">You know in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for children.</sentence><sentence id="149">What we did, we didn't learn much in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, we were, we learned how to sing.</sentence><sentence id="150">I know all the Yiddish songs from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">I sang them.</sentence><sentence id="152">I have a record with all those songs.</sentence><sentence id="153">I have done it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">So I knew all the songs.</sentence><sentence id="155">But you have to understand that the Jewish children did not have the right to live, so a few times in the week they came to take out the children, so the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span>, and we were given brown paper and pencils to keep quiet.</sentence><sentence id="156">So, if you can call it a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I wouldn't call it, but it was a place where the children came, and every day less and less children came because the children were taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and put in, and killed.</sentence><sentence id="157">So</sentence></p><p><sentence id="158">less and less children were in those <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span>, if you call them <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="159">But I was lucky, and I stayed until the end, and during some days, my mother did not send me because we had to eat and there was, and horse meat was very expensive.</sentence><sentence id="160">There was no other meat, so she would send me to sell cigarettes and matches on the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">And as I was a good looking child, people had pity on me so they bought matches and cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="162">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the money.</sentence><sentence id="163">One day I remember, I got beaten up by mother because I gave the money to two children that were helping me and they were they said, they told me that they are hungry and they will help me sell the cigarettes and they were screaming, "Buy from her, the cigarettes, and not from somebody else," so we sold everything and I had money, so I gave them money.</sentence><sentence id="164">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my mamma, mother gave me on my tushie (ph) because she said, "Well, now with what will be buy the horse meat?"</sentence><sentence id="165">And the horse meat was very good.</sentence><sentence id="166">It was a delikatesse, this horse meat, and she always said if he don't have the money, we won't eat meat.</sentence><sentence id="167">So, days in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, look, it was different in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> than it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, (a) Because we were still stronger.</sentence><sentence id="168">We had more food, but we lived a frightened life, a very frightened life.</sentence><sentence id="169">I don't remember much laughter, much smiling.</sentence><sentence id="170">First of all, my mother was already a widow.</sentence><sentence id="171">My sister, who married in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, Zunder Leizersohn, who was one of the first partisans in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">He was smuggling out the people to the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for the, how do you say, , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, and on the last trip of his he wanted to take my sister with him and they were caught, and they were killed.</sentence><sentence id="173">So I do remember that having two widows in this, in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, which we lived, and my sister loved this man very much.</sentence><sentence id="174">I remember he was a very good looking man, and she was 10 years older than me and it was a tragic that he was killed while wanting to take her out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">So to live with a mother that cried about her husband and with a sister that cried about her husband in a, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was no much happiness, so, but that was already the wonderful time, because after that it came only the terrible time.</sentence><sentence id="176">So if I look back to the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, it was paradise towards what happened to me afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="177">So therefore I feel that when I speak about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span>, because I was very short time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span>, I first of all, you know, you get brain washed a little bit, that this is your life.</sentence><sentence id="178">And as a child, I didn't know that there was a different life.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="179">I didn't understand why, why are we suffering.</sentence><sentence id="180">So, you know, I suppose that for the people that had been much more grown up and much older than me, life was probably unbearable.</sentence><sentence id="181">I didn't have sleepless nights from being afraid what would happen to me tomorrow.</sentence><sentence id="182">I suppose that my mother did.</sentence><sentence id="183">So the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, as a child, I learned a lot of songs and there were children to play, still, and so I would played, and in the nights, my mother would put me in the, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> because she was afraid the Germans came, come in and, uh, uh, would take us away.</sentence><sentence id="184">We were, uh, taught not to be loud.</sentence><sentence id="185">When we were sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> we hardly spoke to each other because we were explained that if you speak the Germans would come and kill you.</sentence><sentence id="186">So as children we were taught to do things which normal children outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> wouldn't do it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="187">But it was happy, because I have children.</sentence><sentence id="188">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, I didn't have one.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="189">Nobody talked to me.</sentence><sentence id="190">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, yah.</sentence><sentence id="191">We were playing, we were playing with stones (cough), excuse me, we were playing with, you know, like little stones, to, uh, we were singing.</sentence><sentence id="192">Was terrible, but it was terrible, but it was not so terrible as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="193">Q: Can you sing one of the songs for us?</sentence><sentence id="194">One you remember?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="195">A: I remember many songs, but I am not comfortable to sing a song which has to do like a song which I have sang Polish (ph).</sentence><sentence id="196">If I translate it: "Buy from me the cigarettes, only from me because they are not wet from rain.</sentence><sentence id="197">Buy from me and have pity on me.</sentence><sentence id="198">Polish (ph).</sentence><sentence id="199">Buy from me because I am an <span class="BUILDING">orphan</span>."</sentence><sentence id="200">Those were very said songs.</sentence><sentence id="201">The songs that were, the majority of the songs of the Holocaust were written in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">Vilna had the <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span>, and the majority of the songs were written there, and I know them from that, and I hope that one day you will come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and there is a record which I have done when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, His Master's Voice.</sentence><sentence id="203">But then, you know, I was 19 years old and I wanted to do that to remember.</sentence><sentence id="204">So I had this song and another song which I sang, and the record was level and , which was also very famous song of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="205">which was also written for the <span class="BUILDING">Vilna</span>, _.. Those are the songs that I have learned in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="206">I have not sang them anymore, because I am a happy person.</sentence><sentence id="207">I have wonderful songs now to sing.</sentence><sentence id="208">So, but, if we talk about it, yah, those were the songs that I have been singing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="224">Q: What do you remember about the deportation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="226">A: Of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, the dates of the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="227">Anyhow dates I couldn't tell you.</sentence><sentence id="228">It wouldn't be real if I tell you, but it was the liquidation of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> and they took us out and there was a selection.</sentence><sentence id="229">There was the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and there was the left side, and naturally my sister and my brother were on a different, with the men, my mother and my sister on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I was put on the left <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">Little did I know that the <span class="NPIP">left side</span> is death, but I didn't want to be alone without them.</sentence><sentence id="231">So with all the screaming which went on, and there was screaming going, because I have seen that woman was holding a baby in her hand and she was screaming not to, the German wanted to take away the baby and put her on the right side, so she was screaming that way that he took the baby and threw it on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and the baby died in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="232">That is in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="233">So I saw that I don't want to be without my mother.</sentence><sentence id="234">So there was so much confusion and I was such a little girl that I ran way without anyone seeing it to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I found my mother and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="235">And from there we went to, we were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald-Riga</span>, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserwald-Riga</span>, my memory takes me to a very terrible scene.</sentence><sentence id="236">We already knew, I mean, we already knew, even the children that there are <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="237">And they took us and they undressed us and they said we have to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">Not showers.</sentence><sentence id="239">for the people already knew the showers are not showers, but gas.</sentence><sentence id="240">And I became so hysterical that I said to my mother and that I vividly remember, "You can die.</sentence><sentence id="241">You are old.</sentence><sentence id="242">| still want to live.</sentence><sentence id="243">Don't let me go there.</sentence><sentence id="244">I don't want to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>."</sentence><sentence id="245">And she wanted to calm me down and she said, "No, it's not to be to die.</sentence><sentence id="246">It's just to wash."</sentence><sentence id="247">And I couldn't listen to her.</sentence><sentence id="248">I throw myself on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="249">I am not going there.</sentence><sentence id="250">You are old.</sentence><sentence id="251">You can die.</sentence><sentence id="252">I don't want to die."</sentence><sentence id="253">But anyhow, we had to go in, and my memory takes me that I was so hysterical that I really, when they put on the water saw that this is not water, but this was water.</sentence><sentence id="254">We had to wash.</sentence><sentence id="255">We had to wash.</sentence><sentence id="256">They gave us soap.</sentence><sentence id="257">We had to wash, and we got our establishing dresses, those clothes with, how do you call them, in German stripe.</sentence><sentence id="258">That what I remember, and then the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> started.</sentence><sentence id="259">We were deported from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinenwerke</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dinenwerke</span> we were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">As I understand now by being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span> was a 100,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="261">I never realized that it was such a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="262">And there I was with my mother and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="263">What did we do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>?</sentence><sentence id="264">There was no work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>, but they let us work.</sentence><sentence id="265">They took us from, you had to carry stones from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">You had to fill bags of cement and carry them on your shoulder to the other corner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">Very little food, very little food.</sentence><sentence id="268">And slowly, slowly, my mother was dying from hunger.</sentence><sentence id="269">She was not even a human being anymore.</sentence><sentence id="270">She was such a skeleton.</sentence><sentence id="271">Had big eyes and such blue under her eyes.</sentence><sentence id="272">No hair.</sentence><sentence id="273">If I loved her, no.</sentence><sentence id="274">Because she was not a mother anymore.</sentence><sentence id="275">She was a skeleton.</sentence><sentence id="276">And then one day when we were lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and somebody came to say that your mother died, go and say to her goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I turned my head and I saw they slapped her to this corner where all the dead were and I said this is not my mother, and I didn't even want to say goodbye to her.</sentence><sentence id="278">And I was left with my sister.</sentence><sentence id="279">And still I had my sister.</sentence><sentence id="280">It wasn't so bad, because she was young and she warmed me up and I don't know if I missed my mother so much because now that I reason to myself, there was no much love that a child felt and I myself am a mother, and I understand in this circumstances, where you see your own children dying from hunger and crying, "Mother, I am hungry," and she couldn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="281">So what kind of love.</sentence><sentence id="282">Everybody was to himself, and her thoughts I don't know, but I am intelligent enough to understand today that she was suffering, seeing her two daughters.</sentence><sentence id="283">If she gave us a piece of bread, I don't even remember if she gave us her piece of bread, because the piece of bread that we got was very little.</sentence><sentence id="284">And how unselfish can a person be when he is dying from hunger to give the last piece of bread?</sentence><sentence id="285">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="286">I don't remember if I got from her a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="287">The fact is that she died from hunger and I didn't, so she might probably have given sometimes to me her piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="288">And from then on it was just slowly dying because I had typhoid, there were hours we were both sitting and taking the lice, that we all had lice all over, and the scratching all night long, the scratching that what I remember.</sentence><sentence id="289">You scratched yourself.</sentence><sentence id="290">They were biting you and you took it like this.</sentence><sentence id="291">I must saw sometimes I did get sandwich from a German.</sentence><sentence id="292">I must say that sometimes I did get a sandwich from a German.</sentence><sentence id="293">Sometime, they did have pity on me.</sentence><sentence id="294">Sometimes I got beaten up because I couldn't pick up cement, you know, but I must say to the world today, and this is what I always say and this is what I continue to say, "I don't trust the Christian world anymore."</sentence><sentence id="295">For me, I cannot separate the Germans and the Polacks and the Bulgarians from the Christian world.</sentence><sentence id="296">I cannot separate.</sentence><sentence id="297">I am

they?</sentence><sentence id="300">Do you know how many times in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> I was spit on me, there were spitting because I had the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="301">Has nothing to do with the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="302">How many time did I hear the word in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, Jude, which means Jew.</sentence><sentence id="303">And I was asked by your media people sometimes, "How do I feel to the Christians?"</sentence><sentence id="304">And I would say always, "Yah, today I am 57 years old, 58.</sentence><sentence id="305">I know that there are good people and bad people, but I will never forgive them.</sentence><sentence id="306">I'll never forgive them that they didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="307">That the world did not do anything to save us.</sentence><sentence id="308">And I don't know why the hatred for the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="309">I have never done anything wrong in my life.</sentence><sentence id="310">Not before and not now!</sentence><sentence id="311">I feel I am the same as them.</sentence><sentence id="312">I'll never

id="314">No, and my sitting here is because I do want that the people should know.</sentence><sentence id="315">I do want that the people should know that although the world is beautiful and although today they try sometimes to fight against prejudice, I as Dora Roth will never forgive the Christian world for not doing enough and not doing so that I should have not had to suffer 6 years.</sentence><sentence id="316">This is why I live therefore in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">I have chosen to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as a 13 year old child.</sentence><sentence id="318">When I went into the <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> and they asked me where do you want to go, which <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> do you want to go, to a Zionistic one or to an <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> which stays in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and I didn't understand what Zionism was, but I said I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because I want to be surrounded by Jewish people and not by Christians because I did not trust them.</sentence><sentence id="319">Until today, I fight my own feelings.</sentence><sentence id="320">That's true, because I have seen good Christian people.</sentence><sentence id="321">In <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, we have a <span class="DLF">Righteous Avenue</span> for all the Christians that have saved the Jews, but I myself I fight this feeling because it is not good to generalize.</sentence><sentence id="322">But I suffered so much, looked to stand in front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and I was the third one to stand and my sister was put there and two Germans looked at me and said, "Look at this beautiful Jewish child.</sentence><sentence id="323">Rotten Jewish Child.</sentence><sentence id="324">Ferfluchte (ph) is rotten in German.</sentence><sentence id="325">She has such beautiful eyes.</sentence><sentence id="326">She shouldn't die yet.</sentence><sentence id="327">Took me out and said, "Roth, get out."</sentence><sentence id="328">And my sister, knowing where she was going, made with her hands so I shouldn't follow her.</sentence><sentence id="329">She died.</sentence><sentence id="330">And you know what, how can you even today, when you go back to that moment, how can you believe that someone has the right to save me because of my beautiful eyes.</sentence><sentence id="331">This is only what I had?</sentence><sentence id="332">Only beautiful eyes?</sentence><sentence id="333">I was a human being, a child.</sentence><sentence id="334">Hadn't done anything wrong!?</sentence><sentence id="335">So my feelings to the Christian world is not, is not the best, and probably I'll die that way.</sentence><sentence id="336">Is not that I would do any harm to anyone, and if a child would be hungry on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, I certainly wouldn't ask him, "Are you Jewish or non-Jewish?"</sentence><sentence id="337">That's not with me.</sentence><sentence id="338">I would give the child, whoever the child is.</sentence><sentence id="339">But we are speaking here, you are speaking to me because you want my feelings to, and my story to tell to people that will live after me.</sentence><sentence id="340">So this is my feelings and I am not ashamed to say it.</sentence><sentence id="341">This is how I feel.</sentence><sentence id="342">I don't have anyone except my brother who is not ready to talk about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="343">I don't know what happened to him.</sentence><sentence id="344">He is just closed up to this topic.</sentence><sentence id="345">You can never ask my brother about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="346">It is taboo in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">He doesn't even ask me how my mother died.</sentence><sentence id="348">So it's me that talks about it.</sentence><sentence id="349">My life afterwards was very good.</sentence><sentence id="350">Although I was shot by a German in the last day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.328216" long="19.153972">Stutthof</span>, before the war finished they got an order to go into the <span class="BUILDING">bararacks</span> and to shoot everybody that is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="351">It was in the morning I got 2 bullets in my back with machine gun, but the Russians came a few hours later and saved me.</sentence><sentence id="352">I was operated four times.</sentence><sentence id="353">They couldn't find the second bullet, but they did afterwards.</sentence><sentence id="354">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> but in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, I got high fever and I developed double tuberculosis, and I, all the children went, and I had to be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marano</span>, first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grupino</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> which the Nuns had and then to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> and I stayed 3 years.</sentence><sentence id="355">I had a pneumothorax of my left side, to push the lungs so that it shouldn't breath on its own.</sentence><sentence id="356">And, in 1952, I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and married a wonderful man.</sentence><sentence id="357">Unfortunately, my husband died from cancer 11 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="358">We have two children, Alreet, she is 33, a criminologist; Donny, 27, he is, he finished the Army, he finished the studies, cinematography, communication and media.</sentence><sentence id="359">And I have 2 grandchildren.</sentence><sentence id="360">I have a 7 year old grandchild and a 2 year old grandchild, and my son-in- law is a dentist.</sentence><sentence id="361">We live very nicely in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="362">I love my life.</sentence><sentence id="363">I became a fund raiser.</sentence><sentence id="364">I fund raise for the United Jewish Appeal.</sentence><sentence id="365">I am a fund raiser in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">I dedicated my life to the Jewish people and I do it already since 10 years.</sentence><sentence id="367">I enjoy my life.</sentence><sentence id="368">I enjoy very much living.</sentence><sentence id="369">And just to tell you that I don't hate, there was a program in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, they asked people that speak German to invite German children to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">I put my name on it, and I had 2 German children in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I have 2 children.</sentence><sentence id="371">So, I can tell you that they week that they have been was not easy because every time we talked I thought to myself maybe their grandfather was the one to put my sister in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">Yet, I have done it because I felt that with hatred, and I really mean it, you will not go far.</sentence><sentence id="373">I remember so many times hurting from the non-Jewish people, You are feshtunken Jude (ph), you stinking Jew.</sentence><sentence id="374">So when those two German children were in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, as I ama very, very, very clean person to the extent my children were suffering, I always said, "Well, did you, did you have a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>."</sentence><sentence id="375">And they said to me, "Oh, Dora, you don't have to have a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> every day."</sentence><sentence id="376">The German children, and I said, "No, you don't" Oh, I think you do."</sentence><sentence id="377">And then I didn't want to let them know that I felt they have to understand that I am very peculiar on that, so I said to them, "But, you know, there was a time that the German people said that we stink, we Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="378">Now smell, Donny and Alreet.</sentence><sentence id="379">Do we smell differently than you?"</sentence><sentence id="380">Then I was sorry that I said it because it is not the children's fault what happened and I was very happy that they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I am sure they were talking to their parents or if they had still grandparents that this was a normal family with normal children with no stinking and no smelling.</sentence><sentence id="381">We laughed together.</sentence><sentence id="382">We played together.</sentence><sentence id="383">I showed them <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, and it was my way of saying, "I don't hate.</sentence><sentence id="384">I really don't."</sentence><sentence id="385">My way of saying maybe if everybody would do that in the world, there wouldn't be the hatred.</sentence><sentence id="386">That's true.</sentence><sentence id="387">But I myself am not a normal person as all of you.</sentence><sentence id="388">I look at life differently.</sentence><sentence id="389">With all that, I had a wonderful life, a wonderful 26 year marriage, I have started, I have never been in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="390">I have 2 new university degrees.</sentence><sentence id="391">I have achieved really the maximum one can achieve in such circumstances that I have been left when I was only 17.</sentence><sentence id="392">I entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, was 7; I came out to the free world, I was over 17 because I was also 3 years in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">So I really achieved the maximum one can achieve.</sentence><sentence id="394">But in my, deep in my heart, I do, when I walk on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and see the smiling people, sometimes I say to myself, "Where were you?"</sentence><sentence id="395">And I carry that and my days today I enjoy things much more powerful than others.</sentence><sentence id="396">I enjoy to open the <span class="DLF">window</span> in my <span class="DLF">garden</span>, in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and see the blue sky.</sentence><sentence id="397">I live in a very nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with lots of flowers.</sentence><sentence id="398">I enjoy everything around me.</sentence><sentence id="399">I enjoy tremendously the beautiful things in life.</sentence><sentence id="400">I enjoy <span class="BUILDING">theatre</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">I go to <span class="BUILDING">concerts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="402">Maybe I enjoy too much because I just want to have it, what I didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="403">People ask me what kind of a mother was I.Over protective?</sentence><sentence id="404">No.</sentence><sentence id="405">No.</sentence><sentence id="406">I said often the children said, "Mother, show a little bit more love."</sentence><sentence id="407">Because I said well, if they said I have a headache or I have temperature, I would say, "Uh, that's nothing.</sentence><sentence id="408">It will go away."</sentence><sentence id="409">I feel that I was a very good mother, but not over protective.</sentence><sentence id="410">I have never told my children my life.</sentence><sentence id="411">They didn't want to hear it.</sentence><sentence id="412">My children don't want to hear about the Holocaust, and I try to not to talk to them.</sentence><sentence id="413">I do speak to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> children in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and here.</sentence><sentence id="414">But my own children would like to see a normal mother and the Israeli children don't think that the Holocaust was such a great heroism.</sentence><sentence id="415">I always thought that I was a great hero, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, no, they don't want to know that their mother was once hungry, that their mother was once saw the most terrible rape.</sentence><sentence id="416">They don't want to hear that.</sentence><sentence id="417">So, to tell a life of 6 years to someone like you is very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="418">It's very difficult to tell you the story from day | til the end, chronologically, because (a) there are many things which I don't remember and many things which I don't want to remember.</sentence><sentence id="419">But I understand that one has to talk.</sentence><sentence id="420">If 1 am almost the youngest, then probably soon you won't have anyone to talk.</sentence><sentence id="421">But I don't think that it's possible or feasible or you name it, to go back to everyday life and I see my 7 year old grandchild.</sentence><sentence id="422">The other day I called her up and she said, "Bring me a pair of glasses with birds on it."</sentence><sentence id="423">You know, I am talking to me.</sentence><sentence id="424">I said , what do you want?</sentence><sentence id="425">She said, "Grandmother, you have to bring me a pair of glasses, American glasses, with birds on it."</sentence><sentence id="426">7 years old!And I said to myself, "How wonderful it is to be 7 years old and to want glasses with birds."</sentence><sentence id="427">And while talking to you I say to myself, "What did I want when I was 7 years old."</sentence><sentence id="428">And therefore it is so very difficult for me to put it together, you know, and to say, well, on Sunday, I did this, on Monday, I did this, and year after year.</sentence><sentence id="429">It wouldn't be even real, because I don't remember, I don't want to remember.</sentence><sentence id="430">I want the Holocaust behind me.</sentence><sentence id="431">I have lived, since 1952 that I married, I lived a very normal life, a very happy person.</sentence><sentence id="432">I said yes to talk, because I feel it is important.</sentence><sentence id="433">I try to be real, but how real can one be in telling a story that I was hungry, when today I am on a diet.</sentence><sentence id="434">Really!</sentence></p></dialogue>
