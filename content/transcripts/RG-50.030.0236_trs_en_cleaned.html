class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">This is how stupid I was.</sentence><sentence id="214">I was just...it's amazing when I think about it.</sentence><sentence id="215">At 13, I think I should have been a little more...understanding, but I...I suppose I was scared.</sentence><sentence id="216">It's not fair to say.</sentence><sentence id="217">But there was also that feeling of relief that I don't have to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">And there was also a kind of change in our life.</sentence><sentence id="219">For instance, we had come back from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">We used to go...every summer we used to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="221">And we came back around August 25th, which is very late.</sentence><sentence id="222">War was in the <span class="DLF">air</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">I mean we...we were in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, so we didn't hear that much.</sentence><sentence id="224">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> things were going on.</sentence><sentence id="225">People were being drafted.</sentence><sentence id="226">Things were really going on.</sentence><sentence id="227">I know when we came back, my mom was trying to buy some food, just make sure that there's some food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because she had survived the first World War and she knew that times are going to be rough in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="228">And she couldn't get any...any...any food that really was...any staple food.</sentence><sentence id="229">She couldn't get flour.</sentence><sentence id="230">She couldn't get potatoes.</sentence><sentence id="231">She couldn't get the kind of things that you need, starch, you know, to... and we were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so there was no...there was no food.</sentence><sentence id="232">But what she was able to...to get were all kinds of delicacies, because these were still available.</sentence><sentence id="233">So there were all kinds of canned foods and lots of chocolates and halva and...and all kinds of fancy cookies...uh...uh...dried fruit.</sentence><sentence id="234">She bought what she could.</sentence><sentence id="235">Well that was..., you know, for a kid that was also a little exciting.</sentence><sentence id="236">Uh...What was really strange is, it didn't take long for us to really get hungry for a piece of bread.</sentence><sentence id="237">That was really something.</sentence><sentence id="238">It was... there was no bread.</sentence><sentence id="239">There was no...there was no meat... no...uh...there was no food, really.</sentence><sentence id="240">There was fun food, but you, you know, and, of course, my mom wasn't that...you know, she was holding on to it, too.</sentence><sentence id="241">She didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="242">I remember my brother being very...very unhappy when we finally were able to get some bread when the <span class="DLF">lines</span>, when we stood in <span class="DLF">lines</span> to get the bread after the Germans came in.</sentence><sentence id="243">How my brother was asking my mother for another slice of bread and my mom said, "No, just one slice of...slice of bread."</sentence><sentence id="244">It was...I remember it was so...it wasn't hunger yet.</sentence><sentence id="245">We weren't hungry.</sentence><sentence id="246">It was just the idea that things were missing.</sentence><sentence id="247">I do remember that the Germans walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, on September 3rd, because you see we were so close to the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">And I remember (cough) that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, everybody.</sentence><sentence id="249">Everybody was...nobody was going out onto the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">People were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="251">We heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> rolling into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="252">There was tremendous noise, shouting.</sentence><sentence id="253">There were some shots.</sentence><sentence id="254">People may have been caught in the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="255">I didn't see any of it, but I heard it.</sentence><sentence id="256">| was afraid to go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> even though some of our <span class="DLF">windows</span> were going out into the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="257">And...uh...(Coughing) (drinking water) and I, as I said, I... just remember that we were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the beginning because apparently it was either we were not allowed to go into the <span class="DLF">street</span> or we were afraid.</sentence><sentence id="258">And then I suppose we started going out into the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="259">I do remember two things.</sentence><sentence id="260">I remember apparently being told by my parents to go out early in the morning and try to get some bread in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">And I don't know...I don't remember whether I went with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="262">I think I may have gone with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="263">I know my mother didn't want my father out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and we went and I remember we stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for a long time, and we did get a bread and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">That was the first memory of...of something that was scary because it was dark <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and the <span class="DLF">lines</span> were long and the Germans were standing in a kind of making sure that nobody was getting into the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="265">And...uh...everybody was allowed to buy one bread. (</sentence><sentence id="266">Cough) About 10 days or 2 weeks after we were...after the Germans came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>...uh...they came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...into our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">By the way, in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>...uh...I don't know how many tenants lived there, but not all of them were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="268">They came into the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> and they started to shout, "Alle Juden, Raus!",</sentence><sentence id="269">which means "All Jews Out!"</sentence><sentence id="270">They were telling us to come down to the <span class="DLF">court yard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="271">And I remember my father and my mother, the four of us went down <span class="DLF">stairs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">I think our cook was still with us.</sentence><sentence id="273">She was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="274">She may have come down.</sentence><sentence id="275">She left shortly after that.</sentence><sentence id="276">She went back to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>...to her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">And they took my father.</sentence><sentence id="278">They took all the men, and we went back to our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">And I don't...I don't remember how long my father was gone.</sentence><sentence id="280">I am sure it wasn't very long.</sentence><sentence id="281">Maybe a week.</sentence><sentence id="282">What I do remember is that my father had auburn hair.</sentence><sentence id="283">You have auburn hair, don't you?</sentence><sentence id="284">My father had auburn hair.</sentence><sentence id="285">When he came back, he was practically grey.</sentence><sentence id="286">I...1 do remember that.</sentence><sentence id="287">He was born in 1900, so he was 39 years old.</sentence><sentence id="288">He was grey.</sentence><sentence id="289">And...uh...I also remember that not all men came back, because we heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="290">Apparently, they...they killed some, just at random.</sentence><sentence id="291">But it was also at that time that they chose, that they asked the people who...who was a member of a committee of the Jewish...uh...Jewish Community.</sentence><sentence id="292">If...if..every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had a Rabbi, had a Jewish Community.</sentence><sentence id="293">And I do remember that...uh...no, I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="294">I...I was told that the man who was chosen to be the head of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was a man by the name of [Moinvek Meren (ph)]. [</sentence><sentence id="295">Moinyek (ph)] is a probably somewhat Polish name for Moshe.</sentence><sentence id="296">His name was Meren.</sentence><sentence id="297">He was a...he was probably also in his late 30s, maybe my father's age, and he had...he had worked for us at one time before the war as a...uh... don't want to call it traveling salesman.</sentence><sentence id="298">He was a salesman, and he was...he had a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> where he would...uh...go in and had customers he sold, you know, the products of my father's.</sentence><sentence id="299">You know, my father produced that was, you know, made in our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">And he became the head of the committee of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span>, and probably other people.</sentence><sentence id="301">Uh...My father, as I said, came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; and shortly after that something else happened.</sentence><sentence id="302">Two things happened.</sentence><sentence id="303">First our <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was taken over by what the Germans called a "Treuhandler." "</sentence><sentence id="304">Treuhandler" means somebody that the Germans could trust.</sentence><sentence id="305">It was a German who took over the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but my father was working there.</sentence><sentence id="306">He was in effect probably teaching the Treuhandler and, you know, how to run the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="307">NB: German "Treuhandler" = trustee or custodian] And he...uh....because of that, he was allowed some...he was probably getting some money for his work, and he was given ration cards, and so was his family.</sentence><sentence id="308">Everybody had to work.</sentence><sentence id="309">The fact that my father worked was very important because then we were allowed to get...uh...cards so that we could...we were able to buy food.</sentence><sentence id="310">It was all rationed, but we had the coupons to buy whatever was allowed for us to buy.</sentence><sentence id="311">Now let me tell you a little bit about our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because it was a little different then for instance, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">Until the end of 1942, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.293009" long="19.162475">Sosnowiec</span> was what you called an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, which means that we were not...we were not walled in.</sentence><sentence id="313">And many of us stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">For instance, we stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in 1940...at the end of 1942, except that they had...we didn't have the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> all to ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="315">We had to share it with other refugees, with other Jews who were....

Poles were allowed into some <span class="DLF">streets</span>, the Poles could come into the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where the Jews lived.</sentence><sentence id="324">Because of that and, as I said, because it was that kind of an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there was a possibility for some barter, for some dealings with the Poles; and maybe even with some Germans, although I don't know, or "Volksdeutsch," half-German.</sentence><sentence id="325">And because of that situation in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in terms of hunger, until about 42 was not that bad.</sentence><sentence id="326">It was...it depended...I shouldn't say that...it depended really on what your situation was because the rationing...uh...the food that you were allowed, legally, was really not much.</sentence><sentence id="327">But if you had some other means, you could if you had some hidden jewelry, you could get something on the <span class="BUILDING">black

better.</sentence><sentence id="332">Now that doesn't mean that people were able to keep everything they had.</sentence><sentence id="333">This brings me to the other story....uh...because also shortly, that was all in the fall of 1939, there was a knock on our <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">And there was a German woman and two SS men were with her and she...they came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, and she walked through the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and she turned to the SS men and she said, "Ich habe

id="339">I'm talking about our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">All our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span>, rugs, whatever...whatever she wanted.</sentence><sentence id="341">She was a nice...nice lady.</sentence><sentence id="342">She sent us an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span>, some old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="343">Uh...wardrobe, probably what she had.</sentence><sentence id="344">She must not have been a very well-to-do woman, but you see she became rich because she was German.</sentence><sentence id="345">So we didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> left then and, of course, the German I am sure you know that...that there were from the beginning, they were collecting everything.</sentence><sentence id="346">First you had to give...give away all your gold.</sentence><sentence id="347">Then they came in and they took all your silver (cough) so that there were a lot of things that my parents, I am sure, had to give away, but I am also sure that my mom, or my parents may have hidden some things, because I know that in the beginning of the war we were able to get some extra food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">Uh...Then it got much worse, and about a year...1939...19...in 1940, things were semi-normal.</sentence><sentence id="349">I shouldn't call it normal, but life just went on.</sentence><sentence id="350">My father was working.</sentence><sentence id="351">Then my mother had to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">But I and my sister and even my younger sister were privately

wasn't....there were no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="356">But my parents...my parents, you see, were hoping that the war is going to end.</sentence><sentence id="357">They didn't...they didn't envisage anything like that, and they felt that we needed to continue with our education so...uh...as little as they had, they paid.</sentence><sentence id="358">We had...there were some teachers, professors who used to teach in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and...uh...when I say I was privately tutored, I don't mean that I was tutored on a one-to-one basis, but what we had is we would go to our...to a <span class="BUILDING">teacher's home</span> during the day and there were, let's say, 12 of us, and we would learn.</sentence><sentence id="359">We would study Polish literature, history, geography...uh...some sciences, but that was difficult because we had no lab.</sentence><sentence id="360">Mathematics.</sentence><sentence id="361">I remember working very hard.</sentence><sentence id="362">This was, see, now I was very serious.</sentence><sentence id="363">This was important.</sentence><sentence id="364">I...I...I think I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> til the beginning...(sigh) "til the beginning of 1942.</sentence><sentence id="365">When I say in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I was...I was getting...taking lessons, even though somewhere around "41, I think in the summer of 1941, I started working somewhere in a...in one of those <span class="BUILDING">ghetto resorts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="366">In other words, <span class="BUILDING">ghetto factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">But probably not full-time because I still had some time for lessons, and then I no longer could do it.</sentence><sentence id="368">I had to work full-time and I had to give up, but I know that I studied a lot, and I even took some...a lot of Hebrew during the war.</sentence><sentence id="369">Because it was important.</sentence><sentence id="370">I also tutored my younger, my kid brother who was only six when the war broke out.</sentence><sentence id="371">I taught him how to read and write.</sentence><sentence id="372">I taught him a lot of mathematics, and he was a whiz anyway.</sentence><sentence id="373">He was very good in mathematics.</sentence><sentence id="374">So I...uh...so in that sense there were some, there was a certain amount of normalcy in our life because my parents, as I say, believed in the beginning that things are going to be okay.</sentence><sentence id="375">And...uh...I don't think they realized what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="376">In the beginning, my father, I remember, used to listen to a BBC radio.</sentence><sentence id="377">One of the neighbors had a hidden radio, and he would come back and tell us that <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> fell; and then I think that it was too dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="378">Of course, we also had a curfew and we were not allowed into the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, I think after 7 o'clock in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="379">And that, by the way, was good in one way for me as a child.</sentence><sentence id="380">I read constantly.</sentence><sentence id="381">There were still <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> that you can borrow books from.</sentence><sentence id="382">Private <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, and I used to read.</sentence><sentence id="383">I think that I...I got a...1 got my really basic education during this because I was reading constantly.</sentence><sentence id="384">I...I suppose my parents encouraged it, but I really was always a bit of a bookworm and I... So this was, as I said, things started and...and nobody...nobody realized what...what was going to happen because, again, I am painting a...am giving you a kind of picture of...now, of course, with it...uh... things started to happen in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">People started to disappear.</sentence><sentence id="386">Mostly, at that point, young people were taken to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and...uh... and people would just disappear.</sentence><sentence id="387">They would be walking in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and they would be taken to work.</sentence><sentence id="388">People were also taken constantly to work in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">I remember coming back from <span class="NPIP">somewhere</span> and being...I was still young, so it didn't happen to me often, but it happened to my father a lot that they would take people who had to shovel show, clear the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="390">They were always looking for something.</sentence><sentence id="391">You know, in addition to the fact that people had to work, they were always catching people, if you will, for some additional work, but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, as I say there was a militia and we were again, ...how shall I say?</sentence><sentence id="392">The governing of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was done by the....by the Jewish people.</sentence><sentence id="393">Now when my....
