<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: I know that you were a small child at that time.</sentence><sentence id="227">You must have some impressions of what it was like.</sentence><sentence id="228">Uh how do you think that your mother was able to hear this and still go on in</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Did it sharpen the will to live, knowing that that death could be so imminent?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: I think the will to live is something that does not need to be sharpened.</sentence><sentence id="242">I think it's there all the time and uh I think what happens is is they...the closer one feels that upon one's self, the the stronger the fight is.</sentence><sentence id="243">I've watched friends that had cancer and passed away and their will to live was so strong that uh one does not believe that death is around the comer.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: How did it affect you and your own struggle as a little girl at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: I don't even know how to answer that.</sentence><sentence id="250">How it affected me?</sentence><sentence id="251">You just do the next thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: So do you think that...of course, looking back because it would be hard to recall exactly what happened, but do you think that you you had to distance yourself or tuck it away in a part of your mind until you could deal with it and and just take the next step?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: I don't even think one thinks.</sentence><sentence id="258">I think or at least I felt that uh when <span class="NPIP">danger</span> is there you try to to stay...stay alive, stay out of it.</sentence><sentence id="259">I know one particular circumstance where I lost my mother, got separated in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="260">Didn't know where I was, nobody was there.</sentence><sentence id="261">All I could hear was the Germans calling and shooting, and at that point...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="267">Q: Calling and shooting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="269">A: Calling.</sentence><sentence id="270">Uh they knew people were around there.</sentence><sentence id="271">We were in the partisans at that time already and they were calling out give yourself up and you will survive, and, of course, spraying bullets over the the <span class="REGION">area</span>, and I remember going out to the <span class="DLF">clearing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">I forget...it's better to get shot than be lost in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and going out to the <span class="REGION">area</span> and watching the bullets hit the dirt in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="273">It sort of makes a little puff when it hits the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dirt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">Then I heard my mother calling me.</sentence><sentence id="275">It didn't take me (laughter) a split second to turn away and run, and that I remember very clearly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: When you thought about that decision, uh being lost and alone in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> or giving yourself up to be shot...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: No, not giving myself up.</sentence><sentence id="286">Sooner be shot than give myself up.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: So you were going to willingly walk into...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="294">A: Into a bullet..-yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="296">Q: And...and why?</sentence><sentence id="297">Why...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: Uh you have to understand that at that point we were very much aware of what Germans did to Jews and even though at that point there were no Jews alive that we knew of in any of the surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, knowing that I'm Jewish and knowing what awaited me, don't you think it's easier to take a bullet at random than to have somebody point a gun between your eyes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="302">Q: Your family...you had a father and mother and a brother before the occupation and uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="304">A: There were uncles and aunts and grandparents...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="306">Q: An extended family....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="308">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: Let me go back chronologically a little bit in time and talk about how there became an awareness in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and in your family that the occupation was coming.</sentence><sentence id="311">Not everybody believed it, is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="314">A: Uh you mean the German occupation?</sentence><sentence id="315">Well, once uh the Germans started to fight the Poles, once they declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, we knew that the Germans would be coming.</sentence><sentence id="316">Uh you must understand that we were already occupied by the Russian forces.</sentence><sentence id="317"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided and it wasn't a matter of, you know, will they come.</sentence><sentence id="318">It was a question of when they will come, how quickly they will come.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: Did your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>...the Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>...you talked about toward the end knowing at that point what they did to Jews, but in the beginning you didn't really know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Stories filtered down.</sentence><sentence id="327">Uh stories filtered down about the fact that uh the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were being taken out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="328">Uh Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had run away uh because the Germans were coming in and occupying.</sentence><sentence id="329">Uh some of them who came returned back because the conditions under the Russians were so bad too.</sentence><sentence id="330">Uh my family especially since we were called bourgeois (ph), rich Jews or rich people period, uh we were packed and waiting to be taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">That's what they did with with the rich people, uh resettling them.</sentence><sentence id="332">Probably would have been a blessing in disguise.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: So you were a community knowing that your fate lay either in the hands of the Germans or the Russians, and at that point, did...was there an awareness of what would be better or what would be worse, what your...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="342">A: There was an awareness of oppression under the Germans, but I don't think anybody uh</sentence><sentence id="344">thought of being just shot to death, being eliminated or wiped off the face of the earth.</sentence><sentence id="345">I don't think...as a child, of course, I didn't think about it, but I don't think the general community was prepared for the type of holocaust that that happened and remember something else...all that did not start until a little later.</sentence><sentence id="346">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>...I mean we had no knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> at that point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: But there was a ghettoization (ph) process?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: Ghettoization process was not immediately.</sentence><sentence id="357">That was oh several months later.</sentence><sentence id="358">Uh the Germans came in in I think July and I know it was summer.</sentence><sentence id="359">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not organizing...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: What year do you think that was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="367">That was 1941, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> did not get established until the wintertime, so there were several months, maybe not...six months maybe, five months.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="370">Q: In the time between the time the Germans came in and occupied and the actual ghettoization, what was the transformation that took place in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="372">A: Well, everybody became aware of the fact that the Jews were not treated well.</sentence><sentence id="373">Uh there were incidents of beatings.</sentence><sentence id="374">Uh the next thing was the edict to wear the the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="375">No Jew was to uh venture out without the yellow star.</sentence><sentence id="376">If you were caught, they would get beaten.</sentence><sentence id="377">I don't recall but I think there were even a few instances where people were shot, Jewish people were shot.</sentence><sentence id="378">One of the things that stands out in my mind is uh Russian prisoners of war that were driven through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they were in just terrible condition, uh without shoes, without proper clothing, hungry, looking dilapidated and drawn and went begging, of course, for food and water and if somebody attempted to give them...or couldn't hand it to them, throw toward them, uh anything, any food and if they caught it or even if they didn't, the Germans beat them and even shot several people if they lunged toward the crowd to receive some food, they shot them, and that was I think the first awareness of the brutality of those people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="386">Q: Was there a systematic attempt to set apart and segregate and identify the Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="983">A: Next we went to another gentile family.</sentence><sentence id="984">Again my mother started to choose very, very carefully as to where to go, who she would think would be the the least uh belligerent and we went to this <span class="BUILDING">woman's house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="985">Uh she was a widow and my father had helped her out greatly when her husband passed away and my mother felt that uh that was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and uh when we got there uh she wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">Her daughter was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and her daughter must have been just about a couple of years older than I and uh the daughter knew us very well too, and she hid us and uh I remember the the center of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span>, an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="987">Everybody had to bake bread.</sentence><sentence id="988">It was like an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and to keep warm.</sentence><sentence id="989">It was built out of bricks and it had sort of like a uh a a level area.</sentence><sentence id="990">A lot of the uh farmers would sleep there in the wintertime because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> would be heated up, so she put us there and normally there was some sort of a curtain that was drawn across it, so that's where she put us and that's where we stayed and uh the mother came back and as in many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, the big pastime was to get together and to talk and uh we were up there and this woman crawled up and sat down right in front of the curtain and talked to the people that were sitting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and they were discussing about what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="999">Q: And she didn't know you were in there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1001">A: Oh, she knew we were there because when she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> her daughter had informed her that uh we had come and she put us...where she put us to hide us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1003">Q: How long did you stay there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1005">A: We stayed there probably a couple of nights, until things quieted down because uh this woman had sent a son...she had two sons and a daughter and we actually saw her after the war too.</sentence><sentence id="1006">Uh we know she left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because my mother corresponded with her and after a while the letters just came back.</sentence><sentence id="1007">Uh she was actually of French extraction.</sentence><sentence id="1008">She married her husband who was Polish and was living there, and she had talked about going back to her people anyway.</sentence><sentence id="1009">So I suppose she must have gone back, but what she did was is she uh sent us by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, giv...giving us her clothing, her documents, her daughter's documents, and sent her son with us to take us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1010">Uh actually she scouted.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Uh my mother told her who she wanted...where...where the next stop could be for us and she had gotten in touch with those people.</sentence><sentence id="1012">She went over there and just spoke and she says yes, it's safe.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1029">Q: Why do you think she she did that, that she risked her life...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1031">A: She was...she was a righteous person.</sentence><sentence id="1032">She was a good person.</sentence><sentence id="1033">That's why I said that thank God that there are some people who did not side with the Germans and who had a conscious and uh who had love of humanity and and wanted to help people.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1061">A: Well, the circumstances were such that she figured if anybody had any kind of a debt to pay and they were...and they were good, they would do it, if they would turn us in.</sentence><sentence id="1062">At that point this particular woman had nothing to gain by turning us in.</sentence><sentence id="1063">Uh the next family...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1067">Q: But she had a lot to loose by helping you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1069">A: She had a lot to loose.</sentence><sentence id="1070">It was just that uh I remember her telling my mother that uh my father had come to her aid when she thought that life was over for her and she'll do anything she can to help us out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1073">Q: There was a big realization of informers.</sentence><sentence id="1074">There were a lot of informing going on which would help?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1077">A: Quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="1078">The Germans rewarded the informants.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1081">Q: How did they do that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1083">A: There was an incentive.</sentence><sentence id="1084">Well uh one of the things is uh whatever the possessions that</sentence><sentence id="1086">9 remained from the Jews, they would share in those, uh the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1087">They...the property.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1095">Q: So if you turned in a Jewish family, you might stand to gain some of their wealth?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1105">Q: Were you surprised that some people took the incentive or or sided with the Germans, people you had known before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1107">A: You know, there is no surprise.</sentence><sentence id="1108">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the age that I was at, I don't think I knew enough about human nature to really realize any of it.</sentence><sentence id="1109">I think I was more aware of what was happening, what it took to survive, than what people would do.</sentence><sentence id="1110">I think a lot of it...you know, it's the same as here.</sentence><sentence id="1111">You see people who have very little and yet they go out and help the more needy and you see people who are very well off and they look the other way.</sentence><sentence id="1112">I think it's the same thing with then.</sentence><sentence id="1113">It...it was more as to how people perceived themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1114">Uh sometimes the most religious were the ones that uh that probably would would turn on someone quicker and then there were some that uh truly believed in in saving a human life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1123">Q: Because you're not necessarily talking about helping somebody in need.</sentence><sentence id="1124">You're talking about really a tremendous personal sacrifice to to help someone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1127">A: Well, it's risking your life.</sentence><sentence id="1128">Anybody...anybody saving a Jew, collaborating with a Jew uh stood to loose his life.</sentence><sentence id="1129">If not his life at least his health because a good sized beating can leave one maimed, uh or worse.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1133">Q: What kind of brutality during those times did you witness, did you observe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1135">A: Well, as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through, were driven through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the treatment of them.</sentence><sentence id="1136">It was so cruel.</sentence><sentence id="1137">I mean people who were so hungry and thirsty and if someone uh went for for a bit of food or for a cup of water... mean the Jewish people have always been taught to help, and uh you see people driven through...people ran to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to get especially water and something to drink with, and uh the Germans just turned on them.</sentence><sentence id="1138">I don't recall them turning on the ones that were trying to give them the food.</sentence><sentence id="1139">I remember them turning against the ones that went for the food, and I think this is probably why it left such a lasting impression on me is that if if a man is hungry and reaches for something, he gets beaten and and in some cases shot.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1145">Q: What other methods did the Germans have keeping...to keep the Jews in <span class="DLF">line</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1151">A: Mostly by retaliation.</sentence><sentence id="1152">Promising that nothing will happen to the Jews if they cooperate and uh if anybody uh...if they found that something was done against their orders, by retaliation.</sentence><sentence id="1153">I recall a few men who had escaped to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and uh actually the first partisans I guess I would call them.</sentence><sentence id="1154">Uh when that became known, the first thing they did is gather a certain amount of people, took them out into the the main <span class="REGION">area</span>, the the open <span class="REGION">area</span> was the the <span class="DLF">synagogue courtyards</span>...all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were located around a large <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and shoot them or take them away to be shot.</sentence><sentence id="1155">Uh what they did is to make sure if...1 don't recall...I think they took them away to be shot.</sentence><sentence id="1156">They may have shot several in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> itself but the majority of the time they would take more people and then have the...some return to tell the stories, to tell of the...of the manner in which the the others ones died.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1175">Q: Rachel, I want to ask you...going back for a minute, uh under the ghettoization, there were Jewish leaders, there were liaisons to the Germans among the Jewish community and I understand that some of them argued against resistance, against fighting.</sentence><sentence id="1176">Do you recall that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1179">A: Probably so, because every time that there was any kind of a stand, uh the Germans would uh inflict some deaths and injuries, so it was a matter of I think conscious.</sentence><sentence id="1180">I was much closer to that when we were in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because at that time my mother had made up her mind that she's going to try to uh get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and join with the partisans and uh the leader of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> uh was a a very...I don't know how to put it...uh not really defiant but someone who who had the understanding of what was happening to others and a brother-in-law of his was a physician.</sentence><sentence id="1181">My mother felt that if she, as a woman coming into a group...who wants a woman...who wants a woman with a child that's a responsibility, but if she brought someone with her who could contribute (cough)...excuse me...who could contribute, that uh she would be more welcome and this particular leader's sons also wanted to get away and uh I remember his answers.</sentence><sentence id="1182">We used.to meet in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he had a daughter my age and he wanted his children very much to survive and I understand one of his sons did survive.</sentence><sentence id="1183">However uh would...and possibly the the daughter too, but uh they did want to be in touch with anyone because there were some Jewish people who had hard feelings against their father, but uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1190">Q: Because he had been the liaison to the Germans?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1192">A: Uh yes.</sentence><sentence id="1193">Because in that position I guess there were sometimes when he knew about things and uh it was a matter of uh saving the majority.</sentence><sentence id="1194">Uh...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1198">Q: So was that the underlying...the underlying way of thinking...saving...what was good for the greatest number?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1200">A: What was good for the greatest number.</sentence><sentence id="1201">Actually, he was taken away before the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was uh liquidated.</sentence><sentence id="1202">He was taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with his whole family.</sentence><sentence id="1203">I don't know what the circumstances were but the two sons defied the Germans and managed to run away from them.</sentence><sentence id="1204">I don't know whether the the father would have been taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1205">It ended up that the father was killed and uh the wife...the mother too, but the two sons and a daughter escaped, ran away from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1206">The older son was shot.</sentence><sentence id="1207">The younger one and the daughter were not, and they were hiding out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a little bit and all the Jews there were so scared of their own well-being, of their own survival, they were ready to to uh give them back to the Germans, give them away, and the son did escape and uh really became a hero in the in the partisans, but we don't know for sure whether they survived or not, but that was a very good example where what do you do for the good of the community.</sentence><sentence id="1208">Uh...</sentence><sentence id="1210">D:</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1224">Q: The the reason I asked that question is because when we look back at that time in history in retrospect, a question that always comes is why wasn't there more resistance.</sentence><sentence id="1225">Why didn't the Jews fight?</sentence><sentence id="1226">What was it at that time that allowed this to happen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
