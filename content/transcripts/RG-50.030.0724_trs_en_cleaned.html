<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="59">Q: And when you said that your father served in World War I, could you say a bit more about his experiences during the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="61">A: My father went in in 1914, was assigned as a replacement on the <span class="REGION">western front</span>, and for a time was in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, with a pair of field glasses, to locate where their shells were fa -- were landing, from their artillery, to correct that.</sentence><sentence id="62">He was promoted to noncommissioned officer.</sentence><sentence id="63">And when the battalion commander put him in for a field commission, the regimental commander turned it down.</sentence><sentence id="64">As he explained, that is the regimental commander, this is a Prussian guard reserve regiment, and we cannot have a Jewish officer.</sentence><sentence id="65">Subsequently, I believe in 1916, the unit was transferred to the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">And in the fighting before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="56.859619" long="24.329353">Riga</span>, and what is today <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, my father was badly wounded in the arm.</sentence><sentence id="67">And since it was his right arm, he could no longer fire a weapon.</sentence><sentence id="68">So that after he recovered, they recalled that he had Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 legal training, and made him the legal officer, the chief legal officer of one of these scratch divisions put together for occupation duty in the east.</sentence><sentence id="69">And he spent -- but he was, by this time, promoted, and was what the Germans call a Rittmeister, and that would be the equivalent of a captain in the American army.</sentence><sentence id="70">And he served that way until demobilization in 1918.</sentence><sentence id="71">And then, as I said, instead of going back into the judiciary, transferred to the new German national ministry of finance, something that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had not had between 1871 and 1919.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="85">If you think of your extended family, were there noteworthy personalities?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: I suppose there were two.</sentence><sentence id="89">My grandfather on mother's side was a judge in the <span class="REGION">Rhineland</span>, and came to be what the Germans called an <span class="BUILDING">Oberlandesgerichtshof</span>, which would be the equivalent of a associate judge in the <span class="BUILDING">state supreme court</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">And he was not promoted to chief judge, because he would have had to convert, and he was not about to do that, when it was offered to him.</sentence><sentence id="91">A slightly more distant relative lived not in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, as my grandfather did, but in the Grand Duchy Oldenburg, which is in <span class="REGION">northwest Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">And before the first World War, he was on the top court of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.143153" long="8.214435">Oldenburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">And when the chief justice of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.143153" long="8.214435">Oldenburg</span> died, they discovered to their horror -- that is, the grand duke, and the minister of justice, that the next senior judge was a Roman Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="94">And in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, which is traditionally overwhelmingly Protestant, they did not think that that would work very well.</sentence><sentence id="95">The next senior judge was a Protestant.</sentence><sentence id="96">But by the time we're talking about, 1912, or thereabouts, Oldenburg, because of <span class="DLF">port</span> and industrial development had a substantial Catholic minority.</sentence><sentence id="97">I don't know what the percentage would be, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was 10 - 15 percent.</sentence><sentence id="98">And the grand duke, and the minister of ju -- prime minister and minister of justice were concerned that if they obviously passed over a Catholic, to appoint a Protestant, this Catholic minority would be very unhappy.</sentence><sentence id="99">So they decided to pass over both of them.</sentence><sentence id="100">And the last chief justice of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="101">I've always thought as a historian, that this is an example how people can trap themselves into absolute stupidity, because of course, this had nothing to do with qualifications, politics, or anything of that sort.</sentence><sentence id="102">It was just that they couldn't have a Catholic chief justice, and they couldn't annoy the Catholic minority, by putting in the next, so I guess they annoyed them all, by arranging to have a Jewish chief justice as the last chief justice of the Grand Duchy. [</sentence><sentence id="103">technical interruption]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="121">Q: Can I-- can I ask you about experiences with anti-Semitism?</sentence><sentence id="122">With social anti- Semitism, and you know, like I mean, pre "33?</sentence><sentence id="123">Because you're already touching on it, like you know, the very fact that somebody would have to convert to become --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="127">Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 you know, to take on a position is a -- of course, you know, pointing to ingrained anti-Semitism.</sentence><sentence id="128">I mean, the camera is off right now, I would --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Oh, I see, okay.</sentence><sentence id="130">Yeah, well we can talk about -- I'll talk about that briefly.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="133">Q: Okay, all right.</sentence><sentence id="134">And was your family observing?</sentence><sentence id="135">Did your family have strong ties into the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="139">A: My family belonged to the -- what in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be called the Reform Jewish congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, though by American standards, I believe these would be considered a Conservative congregation.</sentence><sentence id="140">And we went on the high holidays, occasionally on other times.</sentence><sentence id="141">We celebrated Friday evenings regularly at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>; you know, Passover, Chanukah, and other such events, so that -- and in time each of us went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> for some training.</sentence><sentence id="142">So, there was no doubt about the affiliation of the family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="147">Q: How many Jews lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> at the time, do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="149">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> at the time -- excuse me -- was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of about half a million, and there about 5,500 roughly, just over one percent Jewish community there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: And did your family have any experience with anti-Semitism before 1933?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Well, what one has to keep in mind is that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from 1871, until 1919, was a federal state.</sentence><sentence id="154">On the <span class="REGION">national level</span>, there were not legal regulations specifically affecting Jews.</sentence><sentence id="155">But the states that made up <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, had regu -- their own Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 regulations.</sentence><sentence id="156">So that in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, which is where the majority of Jews lived, and where my parents lived, no Jew could be an officer in the army.</sentence><sentence id="157">They all did their military duty, but they knew ahead of time they could -- there were no such things as commissioned Jews.</sentence><sentence id="158">Whereas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span>, the did it differently.</sentence><sentence id="159">There were Jews among the Bavarian officer corps.</sentence><sentence id="160">There was also a rule in <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span>, and I'm talking not about discrimination now, I'm talking about legally established regulations.</sentence><sentence id="161">Jews could not hold administrative positions.</sentence><sentence id="162">So that when my father grew up, he knew he could never be postmaster of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where he lived.</sentence><sentence id="163">In the case of my grandfather, in other words, if he was going to be the chief justice, as the king of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> also, and pro-- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had agreed, being the chief jus -- of the justices meant administrative responsibilities, and he declined to convert to Christianity in order to accept that position.</sentence><sentence id="164">We tend to forget in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that legal disabilities in Europe lasted very long.</sentence><sentence id="165">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, the last major legal disabilities on Catholics and Jews don't disappear until the 1880s.</sentence><sentence id="166">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the last legal disabilities end in 1919, because they were on the state level, not the national level.</sentence><sentence id="167">When my father was in the military, it was very clear as -- as I said, you could not be an officer in this one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, and then later became an officer in a different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="168">There was also, of course, some discrimination.</sentence><sentence id="169">But since I was not alive and adult at the time, I did not really run into those sorts of things until after I became five, six, seven years old, and was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, and noticed what was being done to Jews, and what was discussed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about these things.</sentence><sentence id="170">After the -- Hitler became chancellor in 1933, there was, as I said, on the one hand, until 1919, legal disabilities, I guess you would call them, and then, at the same time, some discrimination.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="191">Q: What is your -- what is your -- what are your fondest memories of your childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="193">A: The fondest memories, I guess, are associated in part with a pet white mouse that I greatly enjoyed, and that became totally tame.</sentence><sentence id="194">And th-th -- what was also important for me was that while Jews could not go to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span>, I couldn't learn how to swim.</sentence><sentence id="195">And there were other such restrictions, for reasons that I've never figured out.</sentence><sentence id="196">There were, at least in those days, no prohibitions on Jews going to the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="197">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> had -- and still has, to the best of my knowledge, a very large, very nice <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">And I enjoyed going there and watching the animals, and I particularly enjoyed the arrangement they had, where for a very small fee, the kids up to a certain weight -- weight, could ride on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">turtle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="199">And I thought that riding on a Galapagos turtle was really very much a -- a wonderful thing.</sentence><sentence id="200">Another thing that I enjoyed as a kid, was that great aunt and uncle, who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span>, outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Essen</span>, had on their <span class="REGION">property</span> -- small estate, I guess you would call it, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">royal cranes</span> that walked around.</sentence><sentence id="201">And I suspect today, because I was their height, they liked to walk around with me.</sentence><sentence id="202">And the idea of walking around with two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cranes</span> that wandered around with me, I thought was really very special and very nice.</sentence><sentence id="203">And since they had also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tennis court</span> where they and guests played tennis, the three of us would sometimes walk over there and watch people play tennis.</sentence><sentence id="204">Unfortunately, nobody had sense enough to take a picture, but I-- I just thought that walking around with two tall cranes, exactly my height, and not on a leash or anything, but that just decided that they would walk around with me, was really very, very special.</sentence><sentence id="205">I also very much enjoyed this grandfather, who by this time had retired from being a judge.</sentence><sentence id="206">We would go to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> where they lived, and feed what were essentially tame deer.</sentence><sentence id="207">And I thought that that was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="208">The other thing he would do, which was probably not nice for him, but for me, was there was a <span class="DLF">switching yard</span>, where there were those small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam engines</span> that put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="209">And we'd go puff puff.</sentence><sentence id="210">Well, we were under the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that we walked on, and we would disappear in the smoke, and then reappear.</sentence><sentence id="211">And that too, I thought was really great, good fun.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="232">Well, you touched already, about the changes that came with 1933.</sentence><sentence id="233">I mean, how did you, as a child, experience the onset of national socialism in Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence><sentence id="234">I mean, how and when did Nazi rule begin to impact your everyday life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="239">A: Well, it began to impact my everyday life in two ways when I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in deg34.</sentence><sentence id="240">In the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself, there were nasty comments from other kids.</sentence><sentence id="241">In the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the time, all kids went to gender segregated <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> for four years.</sentence><sentence id="242">And while in the first part of that, that is, deg34, deg35, ?</sentence><sentence id="243">36, the teacher I have [indecipherable] kind of restrained, I think it would be best to say, other kids.</sentence><sentence id="244">It was rather unpleasant, and in the later years in the <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span>, the kids would beat up on me, and I would have to try to make my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by devious ways, because I didn't want to get beaten up so badly.</sentence><sentence id="245">And I carried with me for the next 10 - 20 years, a tendency to get very bad nosebleeds.</sentence><sentence id="246">In 1934, when my father was tossed out of his job -- he had been allowed to keep it, in the <span class="BUILDING">local office</span> of the ministry of finance, because he was front veteran at the first World War.</sentence><sentence id="247">But when President Hindenburg died in, I believe it's August of "34, then those people were also tossed out.</sentence><sentence id="248">So he normal -- no longer went to work, off every morning, and instead d-decided to earn his living by what the Germans call a devisen berauter, a foreign exchange advisor, and in practice what it meant was that because of his background, he understood the constantly changing regulations on what people leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could take with them.</sentence><sentence id="249">And so, our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> was converted into his Interview with Gerhard Weinberg deg March 13, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, where he met clients.</sentence><sentence id="250">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">front hall</span>, where you came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, became a <span class="INT_SPACE">waiting room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">In other words, people would wait there, and then see my father.</sentence><sentence id="252">So the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> changed in a way, and Dad did this -- that is to say, did this kind of work from 1934 until my parents left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the spring of "39.</sentence><sentence id="253">And the fact that we didn't have a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> any more, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">front hall</span> wasn't available, in a sense, certainly made a change in life.</sentence><sentence id="254">But the main change wa -- I would say, a sense of -- that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> didn't want you there, and that other kids were very unfriendly -- with a few exceptions, not all.</sentence><sentence id="255">And my brother, a year and a half older, found this an impossible situation.</sentence><sentence id="256">My parents took him out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, sent him to live with a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, and he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="257">So that during the school year, my brother was not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="258">He was, as I said, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="259">Evidently, from what I gathered from my sister, she did not have -- I mean, not that everybody was friendly with her, but she didn't have that kind of situation.</sentence><sentence id="260">It got substantially worse after a couple of years, because we were told that the teacher that -- whom I mentioned, was ill, and retired.</sentence><sentence id="261">My parents told me many years later that he had been a Quaker, and had been fired.</sentence><sentence id="262">And so, we got another teacher, who did not restrain the kids.</sentence><sentence id="263">So that was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: Which -- which grade was this?</sentence><sentence id="265">Were you third grade, fourth grade?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: This was the third and fourth grade.</sentence><sentence id="268">And then, my parents were talking about leaving the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="269">And first thought that they would li -- stay out their lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but th -- there was no future for the three of us.</sentence><sentence id="270">We had relatives in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and they applied for quota numbers to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and in fact sent us to start learning English.</sentence><sentence id="271">There were two elderly ladies, sisters, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, who were from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and we went -- started to learn English from them.</sentence><sentence id="272">Though I have to admit that I was probably more intrigued by their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parrot</span> than th -- by their English lessons.</sentence><sentence id="273">And then in the -- after the four years, in the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the time, you went to -- either you stayed, or you went to what was essentially a university preparatory system, a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, and I moved to that.</sentence><sentence id="274">And there we started English.</sentence><sentence id="275">And so I learned a little English there.</sentence><sentence id="276">But of course, then in November "38, I was kicked out.</sentence><sentence id="277">But I started learning English more systematically in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="290">And did the behavior of your neighbors change in any way?</sentence><sentence id="291">People who also lived in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span>?</sentence><sentence id="292">Anything you remember there?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="409">A: Well, I think it came in a -- if you will, in two stages.</sentence><sentence id="410">I cannot give you the exact dates, but they started talking about this.</sentence><sentence id="411">And in 19- fi-- 35 - deg36, and they were talking primarily about the three of us, that is my sister, brother and myself, on the assumption that there was no future for us in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="412">And then, not much later, they began to realize that maybe they should go.</sentence><sentence id="413">And by that time, some other members of th -- our family, were -- either had left, or were in the process of getting</sentence></p><p><sentence id="414">ready to leave.</sentence><sentence id="415">And a critical element in this were two individuals; a great-uncle of my mother's, who had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> around the turn of the century, had married and lived in -- in this coun -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, was a brilliant metallurgical engineer, made a fortune on his patents.</sentence><sentence id="416">And used -- saved it apparently, during the great depression, and used a lot of this money to help members of his family;

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="446">A: What happened was, that after the November pogrom, the British government was the only one on earth that changed its immigration

class="COUNTRY">country</span>, could do their waiting in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, if they could be supported there without trying to work.</sentence><sentence id="448">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then, a batch of -- a number of people in the -- what they call the Friends, we would call the Quakers, went around to what the English call <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> and we would call <span class="BUILDING">private boarding schools</span>, and asked them if they would take Jewish refugee children at reduced rates.</sentence><sentence id="449">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the <span class="REGION">south coast</span> in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swanage</span>, which said, we" ll take two boys.</sentence><sentence id="450">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bournemouth</span>, which is also on the <span class="REGION">south coast</span>, not so far from there, which said, we'll take a girl.</sentence><sentence id="451">So parents took the three of us, at the end of December 1938, and took us by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, and put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>, on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American ship</span>, and that went -- that stopped at the Le Havre in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, before crossing the Atlantic to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">And needless to say, the three of us got off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span>.</sentence><sentence id="453">And so that's how we got out.</sentence><sentence id="454">My parents, at that point did not yet have their exit permits from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but they got them a few months later, and then also came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, to wait for the time when our numbers would come up.</sentence><sentence id="455">But of course, this was all in the background of the November pogrom.</sentence><sentence id="456">And the part of that which really upset me the most was the burning of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="457">I knew that people sometimes don't like other people, and beat up on them, throw rocks at them.</sentence><sentence id="458">I knew, bec -- we tend to forget how much the first World War dominated thinking in the 1930s, still.</sentence><sentence id="459">I knew that people killed each other in enormous numbers.</sentence><sentence id="460">And then somebody had shot and wounded my father.</sentence><sentence id="461">That people were angry at each other and did terrible things to each other.</sentence><sentence id="462">But to know -- and that's not nice, but that was a part of life.</sentence><sentence id="463">But why would people, mad at God?</sentence><sentence id="464">A <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> or <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would be called a <span class="BUILDING">Gottes Haus</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">house of God</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">And that people were so mad at God that they would burn down God's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="466">That to me, as a 10 Interview with Gerhard Weinberg 8 March 13, 2012 year old, that just seemed more puzzling and awful than anything else.</sentence><sentence id="467">How -- how -- what did they think God had done to them, that they would burn down the house?And I suppose that was reinforced by the fact that, after I was kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, I attended for a few weeks in November, early December of "38, a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, which was the old <span class="BUILDING">Jewish building</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="468">So that each day, when I went into <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the ruins -- I passed the <span class="DLF">ruins</span>, let me phrase it that way.</sentence><sentence id="469">But that was certainly the part of this all that seemed even more awful than what they did to people.</sentence><sentence id="470">How could people get mad enough at God to go about deliberately destroying God's <span

the late 19" century.</sentence><sentence id="939">I was interested in how Interview with Gerhard Weinberg *deg March 13, 2012 the Europeans got themselves into the horrors of the first World War, not so much the final crisis, but the 1860s, 70s, 80s, 90s, how they got organized in a way that led them to disaster.</sentence><sentence id="940">And so I wrote my first seminar paper on the crisis of a -- eastern crisis of 1876.</sentence><sentence id="941">But I discovered very quickly in working with ro -- listening to Rothfels in the <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span>, and working with him, that his views of this [indecipherable] were the opposite of mine.</sentence><sentence id="942">Since I could not afford to change <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>, I changed centuries, and worked with him on 20" century diplomacy, rather than 19" century.</sentence><sentence id="943">And out of that came not only my shift to 20" century, but a very important development that would affect my life thereafter, into today, in a rather unexpected way.</sentence><sentence id="944">When I wrote a seminar paper for Rothfels, it was not on 1876, it was on the May Crisis in German and Czech relations of 1938.</sentence><sentence id="945">And at the time that we're talking about, 1949 - 50, the first volumes of the documents on German foreign policy were coming out.</sentence><sentence id="946">These were edited volumes of captured German diplomatic documents.</sentence><sentence id="947">And in the volume that dealt with the May Crisis of 1938, they had inserted not only German foreign ministry documents, but a number of military documents, concerning invasion plans and so on, so forth.</sentence><sentence id="948">And, because I was working on my Master's thesis already, and had decided to do them on German-Soviet relations in the nonaggression pact, "39 to "41, I was unpacking the huge collection of Nuremberg documents that the <span class="BUILDING">law library</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> had Interview with Gerhard Weinberg *" March 13, 2012 acquired, and which is now the big collection of the center for <span class="BUILDING">research libraries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="949">I discovered very quickly, that at least in my opinion, the people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, who were putting these volumes together were making mistakes with the military documents.</sentence><sentence id="950">And in the footnotes to my seminar paper, at the appropriate points, mentioned these.</sentence><sentence id="951">Rothfels, after returning the seminar paper to me, called me into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>, and said that I should pull these all together and look for any others, and prepare a critical note on these volumes for the "Journal of Modern History," one of the professional journals in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, that is edited in and produced by the history department at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="952">Needless to say, I did what Rothfels had told me to do, and wrote, and then the "Journal of Modern History" published in March of "51, a critical note on the documents on German foreign policy.</sentence><sentence id="953">At the time, as I was going towards the finishing of my PhD dissertation on the subject of German-Soviet relations, academic jobs in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> were practically nonexistent, because faculties everywhere were shrinking.</sentence><sentence id="954">This was the only time in modern American history when enrollments were dropping and dropping quite drastically in higher education, as the G.I.s were finishing their education.</sentence><sentence id="955">But I got a call -- and so the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had no leads, or I had no leads whatsoever for any job, until I got a letter from a Dr. Fritz Epstein, who was recruiting for a documents project in the German archives, and who had seen this critical note.</sentence><sentence id="956">I did not know at the time, that he was, in fact, one of the people that I was criticizing.</sentence><sentence id="957">But he read that, and he wrote to me and explained that he was recruiting staff for a documents program.</sentence><sentence id="958">He was flying to the <span class="REGION">west coast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="959">Would I meet him at <span class="BUILDING">Midway airport</span>, between <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, and we'd talk?</sentence><sentence id="960">Needless to say, I was very interested in meeting him at <span class="BUILDING">Midway airport</span>, which under the circumstances seemed appropriate, since it's named for one of the critical battles of the second World War.</sentence><sentence id="961">And he and I started talking.</sentence><sentence id="962">And he was so interested, and I was so fascinated, that he decided to take a later <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> than the one he was booked for.</sentence><sentence id="963">We spent hour -- literally several hours just sitting, talking about documents and about the new edition which had just come out, by the do -- of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Hitler table</span> talk, and on all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="964">And we got through later, I got an offer of a job on the war documentation project.</sentence><sentence id="965">Needless to say, I accepted, and after defending the dissertation in August of 51, moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>, where the records were.</sentence><sentence id="966">But it was essentially the suggestion that Rothfels had made, for me to do this, that got me into the -- that job in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="967">The only other interesting contact that I had was, that he was the only faculty member in my three years at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, who at one point had a group of us, myself included, graduate students, at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, at his <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="968">And all -- at that -- on that occasion, his wife told me what had happened to him in November of 1938.</sentence><sentence id="969">He was -- he -- the -- both Rothfels and his wife were very devout Lutherans, but the family background was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="970">They came to collect him in November "38, and his wife explained that he was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">He'd lost a leg in November in 1914 on the <span class="REGION">western front</span>, and his prosthesis was being repaired.</sentence><sentence id="972">And the men who came to pick him up said, well, we'll be back in half an hour -- this is what she -- what she told me, with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>, and they did come back half an hour later with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>, and took him to the local police lock up.</sentence><sentence id="973">And the sergeant in charge had been in Rothfels company in November 1914, and told the two men to take him out the back and take him <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="974">Soon thereafter he moved to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, and ended up in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> as my father.</sentence><sentence id="975">Came from there then to <span class="BUILDING">Brown University</span> for a short time, and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>.</sentence><sentence id="976">So, that was the one time I was at their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, and his wife told me this story about his rather unusual deliverance in November of 1938.</sentence><sentence id="977">I was his research assistant for a quarter.</sentence><sentence id="978"><span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span>, at least then, was on a quarter system, not a semester system.</sentence><sentence id="979">And he was then beginning to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="BUILDING">semesters</span> at a time, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiibingen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="980">So actually when I finished the PhD, he was not there, but I was, in effect, his last American PhD. And his classroom presence was in certain ways very -- I think very influential for me, because he analyzed the students, and got students to look at ways which were unconventional in a way, compared to most of the textbooks, and the -- I found that very challenging, and very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="981">And Interview with Gerhard Weinberg 8 March 13, 2012 perhaps that helped me a little bit later on when I was doing the teaching.</sentence><sentence id="982">And we stayed in touch, and I did go see him once in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before he died, in the 70s.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1032">Q: Was he ever happy at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1033">Was he ever happy in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1034">I mean, he did go back to a regular <span class="NPIP">position</span>. [</sentence><sentence id="1035">indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1036">A: It-- it's very hard for me to say, because he was not the kind of person to share his views and attitudes.</sentence><sentence id="1037">I have no doubt that he was very pleased to have a decent job, in a first rate <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1038">I did not have the impression that he and the other members of the history department were on very close terms.</sentence><sentence id="1039">But, he continued to have at least a minimal tie to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> afterwards, and so -- and he certainly had a succession of graduate students there, of whom I was chronologically the last, but certainly not the only one.</sentence><sentence id="1040">And at least my predecessor in this situation Phil Wolfson, also played a larger role, and I a very minor role in the research that he did on the German opposition to Hitler, on which he produced the first important book.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1041">Q: Well, let's move onto your early career.</sentence><sentence id="1042">You mentioned already the war documentation project that Epstein recruited you for.</sentence><sentence id="1043">Could you explain what that was, and what that work entailed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1047">A: The American air force, and offi -- Human Resources Research Institute at Maxwell Air Force Base in <span class="REGION">Alabama</span>, have made a contract with the Bureau for Applied Social Research of Columbia University, to do some exploring in the captured German records that had been brought to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1048">My work on this was physically located, if you will, in the old <span class="BUILDING">torpedo factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1049">This is a set of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> crea -- built in the first World War, for the making of <span class="DLF">mines</span> and torpedoes that could be loaded directly onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Potomac River</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1050">In the second World War, it was the place where the American army deposited its World War II records, temporarily at least.</sentence><sentence id="1051">And a portion of this was called the German Military Document Section, GMDS, where the captured German records were.</sentence><sentence id="1052">To begin with, I was asked to do something slightly different, actually, than research in those records.</sentence><sentence id="1053">At the time we're talking about now, "51 - "52 and thereafter, the captured records in American government custody, were all secured and classified.</sentence><sentence id="1054">And we had to have a clearance to work there, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1055">But there were already substantial numbers of German captured records that one way or another, had ended up in all kinds of <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1056">And in order to have some sense of what was going on, it seemed important to get some idea of what was where.</sentence><sentence id="1057">And so, my first job really, was preparing what came to be my first book, the "Guide to Captured German Documents."</sentence><sentence id="1058">Which was partly inventory, partly book listing of captured German records that had ended up in the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, in the Institute for Jewish Affairs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>, in depositories elsewheres in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1059">And in fact that also meant that in the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span>, where there was lots in the manuscript division, I was the one who got to organize these, and set them up, and try to organize them.</sentence><sentence id="1060">Thereafter, like the others, for the most part on the War Documentation Project, were on what was called, Project Alexander.</sentence><sentence id="1061">And Project Alexander was the very secret cover name for our research into Soviet partisans in World War II.</sentence><sentence id="1062">There was an advisory committee on this, for this project, headed by Phil Moseley, Professor Phil Moseley of <span class="BUILDING">Harvard University</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1063">And what we were asked to do by the air force for them, obviously, they were paying for this, through <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span>, if you will, on a contract basis, was the -- what -- what was actually going on in the German occupied portions of the Soviet Union where there were all these guerillas?</sentence><sentence id="1064">And the general -- the decision as we worked on this was, using the German records that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>, we decided to have two kinds of studies; topical and regional.</sentence><sentence id="1065">I got to do the topical study, on the role of air power in partisan warfare.</sentence><sentence id="1066">Needless to say, our air force was very interested in that study on how the Soviets used air power in support of partisan warfare, and how the Germans used air power in fighting partisan warfare.</sentence><sentence id="1067">And I found that very interesting in studying the relevant records, insofar as they were available.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And many, many, many, many we -- decades later, in 2005, noticed when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.9309171" long="27.4790394">Minsk</span>, the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span>, and their Interview with Gerhard Weinberg *deg March 13, 2012 <span class="BUILDING">outdoor museum</span>, World War II museum, they had what they call a decoder.</sentence><sentence id="1069">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">DC3</span>, one of the many that we had provi-- the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> provided to the Russians under [indecipherable] and which was the key <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> in Soviet support of partisan warfare, for flying in supplies, flying out wounded, bringing in officers and so on, so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1070">But they had one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> that I had written about, on display for me to look at in the original.</sentence><sentence id="1071">The regional study that I was to make, was of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yelnya-Dorogobuzh</span> area in the <span class="REGION">Smolensk Oblast</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1072">And that proved very interesting, because it's really about the only anti-partisan campaign the Germans ever had in World War II that was, from their point of view, successful, as opposed to all the other anti-partisan campaigns that my colleagues worked on, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bryansk</span>, o-on other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Belarus</span>, on the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>, on the <span class="REGION">Caucasus</span>, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1073">And then we had specialized on psychological warfare, and partisan warfare and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1074">And then these studies were published in classified form originally, by the air force, after they published my guide to captured German documents.</sentence><sentence id="1075">And then they were declassified.</sentence><sentence id="1076">And then one of the scholars who worked there, on the war documentation project, the -- John Armstrong, who made his career in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Wisconsin</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Madison</span>, sort of edited them into one big book.</sentence><sentence id="1077">And the other project that I then did, was to publish in English, captured partisan documents that the Germans had either seized from groups, or picked up from dead partisans.</sentence><sentence id="1078">And I published th -- I mean, the air force published a big book of mine, "Selected Soviet Documents on the Partisan Movement."</sentence><sentence id="1079">| also did a collection of Soviet partisan diaries that the Germans had seized.</sentence><sentence id="1080">But for reasons which I don't understand, the air force never published that.</sentence><sentence id="1081">So that exists, this collection of diaries exists, if it does anywhere, only in unpublished form.</sentence><sentence id="1082">When Professor Armstrong published this big book that <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> published, "Soviet Partisans in World War II," he added a number of these specialized studies, his own survey of the whole partisan movement and very substantial portions of my book of selected Soviet sources, but no part is my ri-- remember, of the unpublished collection of partisan diaries.</sentence><sentence id="1083">Before I left the project in 54, there were also -- they were beginning to assign us some other specialized studies in this <span class="DLF">field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1084">While I was working on the Soviet sources on the partisan movement, one of my colleagues, Eric Waldman, was doing one on the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- German locally recruited police, the Ordnungspolizei, and another member, Alexander Dallin, was doing a study which was published, on the Romanian occupied portion of the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1085">That is to say, after the Germans and Romanians invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in deg41, the Germans turned over to the Romanian government, a substantial portion of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> to administer.</sentence><sentence id="1086"><span class="REGION">Transnistria</span>, it was called.</sentence><sentence id="1087">And Dallin was assigned to do a study of what happened in this.</sentence><sentence id="1088">And there were probably others, but by that time, I had left the

people then became scholars in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, became very alarmed that -- how could we assure access to these records, after they were back in <span

that we would try to film, with the army's agreement, cooperation, as the records were declassified, so that there would be this sequence, declassification, microfilming, return to the federal

through the AHA.</sentence><sentence id="1238">And then subsequently, after the Ford Foundation money ran out -- excuse me [coughing] da -- Lillian Dowman(ph) put up money for a while.</sentence><sentence id="1239">And then, the Old Dominion Foundation paid for many years of it.</sentence><sentence id="1240">But the money went through the American Historical Association, and this independent committee became the committee on war documents of the AHA.</sentence><sentence id="1241">I was ha -- hired by the AHA in the technical sense then, to be the first director, and had

persuaded by -- or indoctrinated perhaps is the best term, by the head of exhibits and publications of the National Archives, a man by the name of Lysinger(ph), that it was a mistake to film selectively.</sentence><sentence id="1247">And I fell in with this very, very quickly, because I had been using, in the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, for my own research, some of the microfilm the State Department had deposited there from the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> microfilm.</sentence><sentence id="1248">And whatever they thought they were doing in [indecipherable] <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span>, it was editing, and it always</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1249">meant that the same German file either didn't get filmed at all, or got filmed in bits and pieces on different rolls of microfilm, sometimes as many as six.</sentence><sentence id="1250">And then eventually, if you wanted to make sure you had everything, you'd have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and look at the original file, which in fact I ended up doing.</sentence><sentence id="1251">Furthermore, as Lysinger(ph) explained to me that there were two other reasons to film, occasionally selectively, but generally throughout, was that you spend your money on filming, not on selecting, which meant that you could produce much more.</sentence><sentence id="1252">And there's no question that this helped us sustain the program, because as Professor Hale(ph), who was the third head of the committee, but headed it longer than anybody else, told me that if you go to a foundation for microfilm, they're not much interested.</sentence><sentence id="1253">But if you can tell them that for 30 or 35,000 dollars a year, you can turn a million frames into the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, they are somewhat more interested.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1254">The other thing that Lysinger(ph) explained to me, that I was barely conscious of from my earlier work with the Nuremberg material, was that of course, all governments in World War II, used the poorest paper possible, because they wanted to use their resources for things which were a lot more important than requisitions for paper clips.</sentence><sentence id="1255">And therefore, we needed to film, in part for access, to be sure, which was the original concept of the committee; that American, German, British, any other scholars could have acc -- could be guaranteed access.</sentence><sentence id="1256">But that we were</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1257">Interview with Gerhard Weinberg "8 March 13, 2012 also filming for preservation.</sentence><sentence id="1258">And having seen some of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> mimeographed stuff starting to crumble, I did not take much indoctrination.</sentence><sentence id="1259">But, as I said, Lysinger(ph) really put these things to me in a way so that I -- when I set this whole thing up, we did a teeny bit of selective, but mostly filming throughout, and that then continued thereafter, long after I was out of it on the -- teaching in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> or in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1260">But that meant in that -- that it was afterwards possible for the army and the project to cooperate.</sentence><sentence id="1261">When the army started putting money in, especially for the filming of the military records, they would contract with a micor -- with a -- for the microfilming, and the committee's professional people would do the descriptions.</sentence><sentence id="1262">So that when it was all over, of the material that was at one time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>, let me put it this way.</sentence><sentence id="1263">Somewheres between 90 and 95 percent was film.</sentence><sentence id="1264">The material that was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, at least 85 percent, and probably 90 percent went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> un-filmed.</sentence><sentence id="1265">And I remain convinced of the importance of this, and I have to say I have become more convinced in recent years, of the importance of filming throughout, because while lots of people are increasingly thinking about what to do about the fact that the Holocaust survivors are either dead or not going to be with us very much longer, the papers, the records of the Holocaust era, are disappearing too.</sentence><sentence id="1266">Either physically, for the paper, or electronically if they're electronic records.</sentence><sentence id="1267">So that in 50 years or a hundred years</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1268">Interview with Gerhard Weinberg 8 March 13, 2012 from now, not only will there be no human witnesses of those terrible events, any paper, or any electronic records will be either gone, or inaccessible.</sentence><sentence id="1269">So on this particular side of the issue, I have become, if you will, more convinced of the necessity of total reproduction, either in microfilm, or in high density engraving on plates, than I was when we started.</sentence><sentence id="1270">And the other policy that I insisted on at the beginning, and that to the best of my knowledge was followed for -- through the rest of the project, was that where the western allies had not acquired what I would call the -- the top level records -- and the two examples that I recall very distinctly were the <span class="REGION">German labor front</span>, and the German welfare -- the Nazi welfare organization.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1271">As a general policy, whatever was there should be filmed, so that people would have at least something from lower levels, that would give them some idea of what the -- the policies and issues were.</sentence><sentence id="1272">And later on, when the army was beginning to run out of money for filming, I urged them, and I believe they followed, on a somewhat similar basis.</sentence><sentence id="1273">That is to say, all the top level military records were filmed.</sentence><sentence id="1274">But when they had to choose among the division records, after a while, I told them all the air force field divisions, whatever there is, all the security divisions, whatever there is.</sentence><sentence id="1275">Whatever the field training divisions, whatever there is, because there you -- you were again dealing with an important subject, but only fragmentary surviving records.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1278">Q: Yet, if you were to summarize, what did the microfilming project achieve?</sentence><sentence id="1279">What does it mean for scholarship, just to get that idea across?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1280">A: Well, it means that there is access, now and into the future, of an enormous quantity of German records from the 1930s and 40s, on essentially all aspects of events, and that can be accessed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, that can be accessed elsewheres by either purchase or borrowing.</sentence><sentence id="1281">And that for one of the most dramatic areas of world history, and the largest war ever fought that we know about, and the horrendous catastrophe of the Holocaust, there are records that people who are interested can have access to, essentially today, without restrictions, and that they can make the most of.</sentence><sentence id="1282">And that there was no opportunity, as there was after the first World War, for the postwar German government to restrict access, even if it wanted to.</sentence><sentence id="1283">I'm not suggesting that with certain exceptions, the German postwar government has wanted to, but needless to say, in the 1950s, nobody knew this, and we were looking at the past experience, which people had, as opposed to the future experience, which for very good reasons, people hadn't had yet.</sentence><sentence id="1284">And there was one other aspect to this that I think is important, and that is, it created, if you will, a kind of precedent.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Why keep the records of country X closed, if those of country Y are open and accessible?</sentence><sentence id="1286">Why not open American records for the period on which the German records are open?</sentence><sentence id="1287">So that there is, if you will, a -- a --a certain impetus, if you will, that the declassification, and then microfilming of German records has had for the opening of other records.</sentence><sentence id="1288">There is one final point that's closely related to this, I would argue, and that is that those who might have preferred closure of German records in postwar Germany, realistically didn't have a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1289">And the dramatic example of this that I would site, is the German scholar Derscha(ph), who wanted access to some personnel records of the German foreign ministry, which were denied to him.</sentence><sentence id="1290">And who then discovered that they were on microfilm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1291">The -- the possibilities, in other words, and the temptations simply haven't been there.</sentence><sentence id="1292">And while I don't want this to be read as a general attack, cause as I said, the -- the German government of federal republic was on the whole, very cooperative.</sentence><sentence id="1293">There was never much of a temptation to go in another <span class="NPIP">direction</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1309">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1310">One of your major publications after the dissertation is related to your work with the captured records, you published Hitler's second book.</sentence><sentence id="1311">Republished it in German, with a German publisher in 1961.</sentence><sentence id="1312">What is this second book?</sentence><sentence id="1313">What is the story behind this peculiar document?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1319">A: In the 19 later 50s and 60s, I was working on the origins of the second World War and German foreign policy.</sentence><sentence id="1320">In the process I saw a couple of references to Hitler having dictated another book.</sentence><sentence id="1321">I was back teaching, first at Kentucky, then at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michigan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1322">But in the summer of "58, I went back to assist my successor as director Interview with Gerhard Weinberg ~ March 13, 2012 of the project, Dr. Dagmar Perman, and was going through piles of stuff to describe and set up for microfilming and came across this one sheaf, it's around 300 pages of typescript, which was labeled as a draft, or partial draft of "Mein Kampf."</sentence><sentence id="1323">And when I started reading it, it was perfectly obvious this is no draft of "Mein Kampf," it's clear from the <span class="DLF">opening lines</span>, literally, that this was a second book.</sentence><sentence id="1324">Not long after, two things happened, which made the publication possible.</sentence><sentence id="1325">One was, that it turned out that back in "45, after this document was confiscated at the Nazi public party's <span class="BUILDING">publishing house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> by the Americans, they had made a microfilm of it back in 45, and provided it to the British.</sentence><sentence id="1326">And under those circumstances, the British representative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> allowed me to have a copy made from their microfilm, so I could start working on preparing a text for publication.</sentence><sentence id="1327">I got subseq -- abou -- a few months later, a letter from Rothfels, who by this time was associated with the Institute for Contemporary History in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, that they had heard about this book, and he sent me the correspondence, and I wrote back and told him yes, I just found it.</sentence><sentence id="1328">And so, it seemed best to publish it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">Institute</span>'s publication series.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And i-it took a while, and there were problems with the Bavarian government, which was very hesitant and put a publication run limit on the print of the book.</sentence><sentence id="1330">And the, excuse me, Institute had to deal with the Hitler heirs, to make sure there weren't going to be problems about the rights, which they bought for a Interview with Gerhard Weinberg "" March 13, 2012 few hundred marks from them.</sentence><sentence id="1331">And so then I put it out in 1961 in German, and it took me til 2003 to get a publisher to put it out in English.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1346">Q: During the 70s and 80s, you were very much known as the specialist on Nazi foreign policy.</sentence><sentence id="1347">You published two volumes, "The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany," and they" re still among the standard works on -- on the topic.</sentence><sentence id="1348">Why did you choose the topic of Nazi foreign policy at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1352">A: I chose the topic because then, as I might add, still today, there is a new book on the origins of World War I every six weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1353">But there didn't seem to -- there doesn't seem to be similar interest in the origins of World War II.</sentence><sentence id="1354">And while I have nothing against people studying the origins of World War I, having at one time myself thought of doing something on the diplomacy of the late 19" century, that set the stage for the first World War, it seemed to me preposterous that nobody had done anything similar, seriously looking at the origins of World War II.</sentence><sentence id="1355">I was convinced, and I'm must -- then, when I started on this, and remain convinced today, that after the experience of World War I, which was most unpleasant for all concerned, winners and losers, there was no one else on the face of the globe who was going to start another World War, than the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1356">It was true, and it happened, that local wars would be started by others.</sentence><sentence id="1357">A civil war in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1358">But that was a civil war.</sentence><sentence id="1359">The Italians were going to revenge their earlier defeat by the people of <span class="COUNTRY">Abyssinia</span>, and Interview with Gerhard Weinberg *!</sentence><sentence id="1360">March 13, 2012 what you really had was the last of the great colonial wars.</sentence><sentence id="1361">The Japanese had fought one war with <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and one with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and now would fight another one with <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1362">There was always the possibility of another war in <span class="REGION">South America</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that had been at war repeatedly in the 19" century.</sentence><sentence id="1363">There was always the possibility of some war between who knows, the Hungarians and the Romanians, who were always itching to do that, but fortunately didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1364">But starting another World War, nobody after 1918, other than possibly the Germans, were going to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1365">And so, I figured that since nobody else was doing anything seriously on the origins of World War II, the best way to do this was to organize it around the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the initiative came from.</sentence><sentence id="1366">And while there were people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the per -- in the 1920s, who were thinking seriously of the possibility of maybe trying to take back some of the <span class="REGION">land</span> they'd been forced to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, or -- o-or who knows what else, no one other than Hitler was thinking of anything bigger.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And so, I decided that the way to organize an origins of World War II book, was around German foreign policy after 1933.</sentence><sentence id="1368">And aster -- after I had gotten into it for a while, it became clear to me, and by discussion with a man who was doing this from the <span class="REGION">institutional side</span>, whom I got to know, Professor [indecipherable] Jacobson(ph), that I'd best do this in two books, rather than one.</sentence><sentence id="1369">Now, they are now available in one book, but I'm talking about when I was doing them, at the time, so out of this came the two books on Hitler's foreign policy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1390">Q: From our perspective, 2012, do you think that Nazi foreign policy and international diplomacy during the 1930s are topics still worth exploring, or have they run their course?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1392">A: Well, there is now, ironically it appeared last year, what literally one other book in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, and this was the British historian Zara Steiner, who had written the book, "The Triumph of the Dark," which is an European international history of the 30 -- of the "33 - deg39 period.</sentence><sentence id="1393">And I have a very high opinion of her, and of her work, which follows a book she did on the 1920s.</sentence><sentence id="1394">Big book, very big book.</sentence><sentence id="1395">But I think that there may well be issues in there that are still worth looking at.</sentence><sentence id="1396">But other than her, and as I said, the book just came out last year.</sentence><sentence id="1397">People just don't seem much interested.</sentence><sentence id="1398">They're interested in the war itself, and they continue, as I s -- told y -- mentioned, to turn out books on the origins of the first World War, another one comes out every year.</sentence><sentence id="1399">But I do not feel, frankly, that I have a copyright on either the 1930s or the war, and that if someone else would like to do this, they are welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1400">The one caution that I would put in there is that the amount of records that is available, is very big, and you better be prepared to spend a lot of time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1412">Q: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1413">The -- the <span class="BUILDING">German foreign office</span> itself, as an institution, has recently attracted renewed attention.</sentence><sentence id="1414">There was a -- a German historical commission looking in to the history of the <span class="BUILDING">German foreign office</span> during the 1930s, and during the war and the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1415">And the book was published in 2010, called "The German das amt(ph)."</sentence><sentence id="1416">Made a bit of splash in the German press.</sentence><sentence id="1417">What do you think of that study?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1424">A: Well, I wa-- I have the book and I've read it, but it's a very interesting and I know at least a few of the people who've been involved in preparing it.</sentence><sentence id="1425">I think it's quite thoughtful, but it does not, in my judgment dig sufficiently carefully into some of the people involved, and their actions.</sentence><sentence id="1426">Let me -- the best way to put this clear is an example.</sentence><sentence id="1427">One of the central figures in the German foreign ministry in the 30s and 40s, was Ribbentrop's Secretary of State, Ernst von Weizsacker, who was tried after the war, sent to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for a few years.</sentence><sentence id="1428">At one time during the war, when the Germans were rounding up Jews to be killed, they also tried to get them from the <span class="REGION">occupied countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1429">And when they started after the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, the Finnish -- excuse me, the Swedish government, informally sounded in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, whether it would satisfy the Germans if they took these Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1430">That sounding was made to Weizsicker, and he waved it off.</sentence><sentence id="1431">The document was published, in fact, by the Germans, in the series a -- the German edited series of the wartime foreign office documents from December "41 to May of "45.</sentence><sentence id="1432">This, of course, is why the next year, when the Germans went after the Danish Jews, the Swedish government, instead of quietly asking, is it okay if we take them, announced on the radio, we will take them, and the Danes put the Jews on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and sent them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1433">Now, that complex is completely missing from this.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Weizsacker's role, in the negative sense, which ironically would have a positive impact for the Danish Jews, but negative for many from <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1435">And yet, it seems to me that that's an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the people who put together Das Amt(ph) certainly did not dig carefully enough into, in this instance, the published record.</sentence><sentence id="1436">We're not talking about some great secret here.</sentence><sentence id="1437">The document -- the relevant key document was published many years ago, and is in <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span>, and not just in mine.</sentence><sentence id="1438">And I think that there are other <span class="REGION">areas</span> where a more careful look -- now what, of course, I don't know, is what, if anything, was edited out by the official authors of the book, who had people working for them, who may very well -- I have no way -- no inside knowledge here -- turn up things that for one reason or another they didn't include, or get around to.</sentence><sentence id="1439">But it is, at least, I would argue, a respectable start into a set of issues about continuity and change, that is helpful.</sentence></p></dialogue>

text of the second volume of the study of Hitler's foreign policy.</sentence><sentence id="1462">And I had to decide what to do next.</sentence><sentence id="1463">And I will tell you why, of the various possibilities, which I won't go into, I decided to do a World War II history.</sentence><sentence id="1464">I'm talking about "78.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I was very dissatisfied with the existing literature on the war, for the following reasons, most of which, I'm afraid, still hold.</sentence><sentence id="1466">One was that most of those who've written on the war, make the same mistake the Germans and Japanese made during the war, it never occurred to them that the earth is round.</sentence><sentence id="1467">You would get long discussions of the war in Europe, quite separate from long discussions of the war in the Pacific.</sentence><sentence id="1468">But the leaders had to make decisions about both, as they were both going on.</sentence><sentence id="1469">The most recent edition of one of the major, well-known books on the war, I won't mention the authors here, in fact comes out in two volumes.</sentence><sentence id="1470">The European war, the Pacific war.</sentence><sentence id="1471">But they did not take place on different <span class="NPIP">planets</span>, in different centuries.</sentence><sentence id="1472">They took place on the same cent -- in the same century, on the same <span class="NPIP">planet</span>, and choices, allocation of resources, decisions about where to launch offensives or defensive [indecipherable] process, all had to be made by the folks at the top, about both simultaneously.</sentence><sentence id="1473">From -- a second aspect of the literature that I was very disturbed Interview with Gerhard Weinberg "6 March 13, 2012 about was -- especially in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, was a reliance on German military memoirs, especially those translated into English.</sentence><sentence id="1474">And since this is, to a very considerable extent, a collection of garbage, the -- people had been, and allowed themselves to be misled.</sentence><sentence id="1475">I see recently -- I won't mention the author, a big book on World War II, where the person still believes the fairy tale that Field Marshall Manstein put into his personal memoirs, that he had ordered [indecipherable] isolated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> to break out.</sentence><sentence id="1476">The reality is he made -- gave no such order, but fabricated it in his memoirs.</sentence><sentence id="1477">The oten -- third factor that I found very troubling, was the absence of purpose from most of the literature.</sentence><sentence id="1478">The Germans did not start the war because the French would not allow Hitler to see the <span class="BUILDING">Eiffel Tower</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1479">There was a purpose to the war, and it was not that they had an army they didn't know what to do with one weekend.</sentence><sentence id="1480">The war was to start a demographic revolution on the globe, of which killing all Jews was to be a central part.</sentence><sentence id="1481">Now I've always argued it is not a coincidence that when Hitler ordered in writing, the killing of the handicapped, in late October deg39, he dated it for September "39.</sentence><sentence id="1482">And nobody can persuade me that that's because they didn't have a calendar.</sentence><sentence id="1483">He also, in his speeches, published by the Nazi regime, in -- during the war, would repeatedly refer to his promise to kill all Jews in Europe, on 30 -- January "39, always said he did it on -- for September "39.</sentence><sentence id="1484">Now these two quite deliberate mis-datings, are, in my Interview with Gerhard Weinberg *" March 13, 2012 personal opinion, an interesting way of providing insight into the way Hitler and his associates were thinking.</sentence><sentence id="1485">That is to say, the demographic revolution was what the globe -- what the war was about.</sentence><sentence id="1486">It was not that he always wanted to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1487">When a killing squad is assigned to Rommel in the summer of "42, it was not because Rommel was sent into <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> so that they could dismantle the <span class="DLF">pyramids</span>, and re-erect them outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1488">It was so that they -- he could supervise the killing of all Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, before the <span class="REGION">area</span> was turned over to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, as Hitler planned to do, and he didn't trust the Italians to do a thorough job.</sentence><sentence id="1489">And he had very good reasons for -- for this.</sentence><sentence id="1490">The war wasn't started, as I said, without some purpose.</sentence><sentence id="1491">And much of the literature on the war, completely disregards what was about.</sentence><sentence id="1492">And I've always thought it was very interesting, that in the winter of "41 - 42, in the German records, the diary of Fremborg(ph), the correspondence of Stief(ph), they comment on the fact, there are no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to send winter uniforms to our soldiers who are freezing to death.</sentence><sentence id="1493">While on the same <span class="DLF">tracks</span> there are plenty of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to take Jews from <span class="REGION">central Europe</span> to eastern -- to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1494">The priorities of the regime, from time to time, were very clear, but that was missing from the literature.</sentence><sentence id="1495">A fourth part of the literature that alarmed me back in "78, was that there had been, in the earlier 70s, and mid-70s, very large scale declassification of documents.</sentence><sentence id="1496">And most people writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, found it most expedient not to look at them.</sentence><sentence id="1497">And I knew from my work on foreign policy, that that's a very time consuming business, and you have to get some grant money to spend time in <span class="BUILDING">archives</span>, but wasn't it about time that these things were utilized?</sentence><sentence id="1498">So I decided -- and by this time, you understand, I'm ho -- I'm holding an endowed chair professorship at the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1554">A: But the -- but the text went off to the publisher in "92.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1556">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="1557">Was it easy to find a publisher for such an ambitious project?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1560">A: Well, the first publisher, after they saw being part of it, decided that they could not publish a thousand page book on World War II, and so I said okay, though they subsequently published a thousand page book on the British navy in World War II.And I kid them periodically as to the number of copies of that that they may have sold.</sentence><sentence id="1561">The next publisher was a university publisher in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, who got confused as to what to do, and so on, so forth, so I shifted.</sentence><sentence id="1562">The Cambridge University Press editor came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to see me.</sentence><sentence id="1563">And they decided they would do it, and a -- since they had just published a book on an important figure, for which they were charging either 80 or 90 dollars, I insisted I would not sign with them, unless they would promise to keep the cost of the hard bound book under 40 dollars, which they proceeded to do.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And it was kind of interesting that when they sent -- I suggested that they keep the margins smaller, and that would keep down the number of pages.</sentence><sentence id="1565">And they assured to -- I was informed, politely, that they had been publishing books in a certain way for several hundred years, and they were not going to change, even if it would save a hundred pages.</sentence><sentence id="1566">So, it came out, and -- in deg94, and they had a marvelous copy editor, whom I got to know, who was in the Wrens, the women's navy, British navy in World War II, and who was very good, and did a fabulous job of copy editing.</sentence><sentence id="1567">And they printed it, and at least to begin with, the hardbound was, I think, 35.95, or 36.95, and the softbound was well under 20 dollars.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1578">Q: So beyond the competitive pricing of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">book</span>, how do you explain the success of this book?</sentence><sentence id="1579">Which nerve did you hit with it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1585">A: Well, I think that there are a number of people who have told me they like the comprehensive coverage.</sentence><sentence id="1586">They like the fact that if they want to, they can dip into it, read a chapter on the <span class="REGION">home front</span>, read a chapter on weapons systems.</sentence><sentence id="1587">Read something about the Pacific war, if they're interested, read something about the war in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1588">They -- the style appears to appeal to people.</sentence><sentence id="1589">Scholars like it because in the back notes, I refer to the archives, and to issues that still need to be investigated.</sentence><sentence id="1590">And although I repeatedly am told that the -- when faculty assign it as a text in World War II courses, at first the students are aghast, because they see the size of the book.</sentence><sentence id="1591">They then like it.</sentence><sentence id="1592">It reads well, they tell me, and in one <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, where it was dropped for another, the students rebelled and said, we want that one back.</sentence><sentence id="1593">The price has -- has unquestionably helped, and of course, by the time tens, and by now hundred thousands are in print, that means that the students who use their computers, or their <span class="BUILDING">bookstores</span>, can find used copies at very reasonable prices, at a time when other textbooks, including ones in this <span class="DLF">field</span>, are getting more and more and more expensive, a-and this one is accessible financially.</sentence><sentence id="1594">And of course, I always remind people who talk about the size, I tell them it was a big war, and that's not my fault.</sentence><sentence id="1595">And that they are -- that is is a multiuse book.</sentence><sentence id="1596">That in the summer they can use it as a doorstop, and that in the winter they can keep it in the trunk of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, and then they will not skid on ice, and if they run into a snowdrift, they have something to read.</sentence><sentence id="1597">So there are all kinds of advantages, in addition to the actual contents o-of it.</sentence><sentence id="1598">And th-there's been translated into German, Spanish, Polish, I thi -- I'm not -- Italian.</sentence><sentence id="1599">And it's supposed to be translated into one or two other languages, but I have no idea whether it will or not.</sentence><sentence id="1600">The only one that I checked against the original was the German edition.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1618">Q: Okay. [</sentence><sentence id="1619">break] Which are the major scholarly debates you found yourself involved in, over the course of your career?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1622">A: Well, the first one came when I was asked by the quarterly for contemporary history in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, in view of my prior writings and work, to write a article on the German decision to invade the Soviet Union.</sentence><sentence id="1623">And since I had worked on this a good deal, I wrote an article for them in German, had the German corrected by my father, and sent it off, and they published it.</sentence><sentence id="1624">We're talking about around "54 or five.</sentence><sentence id="1625">And then, two German scholars responded with an article arguing quite differently, and I was given the opportunity to respond to them.</sentence><sentence id="1626">Ironically, the key figure who wrote disputing what I had written was Andreas Hillgruber, a German scholar who ironically then eventually came around to my view, and in his bi-- big book on the subject of Hitler's strategy, took my position rather than the one, that along with Seraphim, who had been his dissertation director, had taken in their response to me.</sentence><sentence id="1627">Thereafter, I was not really so much in direct disputes, as taking positions that others very often did not agree with.</sentence><sentence id="1628">And that continues to be the case.</sentence><sentence id="1629">And that is true, particularly I would argue, i-in relation to Holocaust studies, where the tendency in the last 30 years or so, has been to do Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.</sentence><sentence id="1630">Everybody wants to look and does look at this district commissioner, that military figure, that local governor, that Gauleiter, or whatnot, but nobody wants to look at Hitler any more.</sentence><sentence id="1631">And that's one <span class="REGION">area</span> there, where I rather disagree.</sentence><sentence id="1632">That is to say, in a society, not just in a dictatorial society, but also in a democratic society, the tone is set at the top.</sentence><sentence id="1633">And then people try to accommodate themselves.</sentence><sentence id="1634">They have lots of discretion and accommodate themselves in different ways, and do it differently.</sentence><sentence id="1635">But unless one looks at where and what the impetus is, people miss what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="1636">And I think it is interesting, to take just the one rather dramatic example, but there has just appeared a big book on the Holocaust in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> by Jean Ancel.</sentence><sentence id="1637">And he makes it very clear that there's lots of persecution of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and by Romanians; the Iron Guard, the government and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1638">And there are some pogroms.</sentence><sentence id="1639">But it's when the dictator of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, Antonescu meets with Hitler personally on the 12" of June, 1941, and Hitler tells him that after -- that when the newly occupied territories fall under German and Romanian control, all the Jews there are to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1640">And it is then that the Romanians change.</sentence><sentence id="1641">And having killed and persecuted lots of Jews before, and having killed maybe a couple thousand, in the following two years they kill over 400,000.</sentence><sentence id="1642">I would suggest that there is a difference when a degree becomes a differ -- difference in kind.</sentence><sentence id="1643">That aspect, you see, I -- I see differently from most.</sentence><sentence id="1644">The other aspect which I see differently from most is that people keep yakking about killing the Jews in Europe, and being unwilling to face up to Hitler's view that all on earth needed to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1645">When the Germans killed the Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dodecanese islands</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aegean</span>, they are living in what by German definition is a part of <span class="REGION">Asia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1646">When they attach a killing squad to Rommel's <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="REGION">north Africa</span>, at least on my atlas, neither <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> nor <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> is a part of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1647">And what people simply don't want to face up to is that Hitler personally at great length explained to the grand ra -- mufti of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>, that Jews on the whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> have to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="1648">But people find that too frightening, I guess, to think about.</sentence><sentence id="1649">And s-so therefore, they keep talking about Europe, Europe, Europe, Europe, and ignore the fact that it was the military operations of the Soviet Union, Great Britain and the United States that essentially confined a worldwide scheme, to Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1650">So there are some issues there, which I continue to see differently from most.</sentence><sentence id="1651">The other -- another <span class="REGION">area</span>, I guess where -- although it's only been explicit once, I see it differently from many, not all, is on the German military leadership of the second World War, which I would suggest that the top and strategy was generally incompetent, when others think was competent.</sentence><sentence id="1652">And that it has become a kind of cliche, that they always disagreed with Hitler, and they were right and he was wrong.</sentence><sentence id="1653">And usually they agreed with him, and very often when they disagreed, he was as often right as they were.</sentence><sentence id="1654">In the Pacific war, I have, for many years been intrigued by the total neglect and the discussion of the Japanese plans of which we knew, to kill all allied prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="1655">And of the Japanese agreement at the top, that when the allies invaded the home islands, Japanese casualties would be 20 million.</sentence><sentence id="1656">It may well be, I have often thought, that the Japanese award in the 60s, of the highest decoration to a foreigner, to General LeMay, who commanded the assault on -- air assault on the <span class="REGION">home islands</span>, including the great fire raid on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span>, and the atomic bombs.</sentence><sentence id="1657">Perhaps they realized that 150,000 is considerably smaller number than 20 million, but many of my colleagues in American history cannot get that arithmetic as straight as evidently the Japanese have.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1697">Q: You have taught at four <span class="BUILDING">universities</span>; <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span>, <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1698">You had a long, fruitful career as a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="1699">When, and under what circumstances did you begin to teach the Holocaust?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1703">A: There are two quite separate answers to that.</sentence><sentence id="1704">I have taught the Holocaust as a part of modern Europe, modern German, and World War II history as long as I've taught, starting, ironically, back in 1954.</sentence><sentence id="1705">The first time I have taught a course Interview with Gerhard Weinberg (r) March 13, 2012 entitled Holocaust was here at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span>, and that would have been, I would say a little -- 20, or a little over 20 years ago.</sentence><sentence id="1706">The -- the history department at this <span class="BUILDING">university</span> has a program of undergraduate seminars called, History 90s, because that's their number in the catalog.</sentence><sentence id="1707">These are limited to 15.</sentence><sentence id="1708">I introduced a History 90 on the Holocaust, which was the first Holocaust taught -- ever taught here, around 20 years ago, or a little more.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And it always filled.</sentence><sentence id="1710">But, at the same time, I had lots of other teaching responsibilities, and the survey courses; Western Civ, the World since 1945, a big course I introduced.</sentence><sentence id="1711">German history, European 20" century.</sentence><sentence id="1712">So I would teach this, if you will, one Holocaust seminar for undergraduates, over and o --anumber of times over the years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1724">Q: And what were the reactions to this new course?</sentence><sentence id="1725">I mean, what -- how did the students react to it, how did other faculty react to it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1728">A: Well, other faculty reacted to it in a normal way that a committee has to approve courses, and they did.</sentence><sentence id="1729">With more or less enthusiasm, I frankly don't know, because that is essentially a routine operation.</sentence><sentence id="1730">The students filled it up every time, and then when it got to 15, it was closed, because that was the way that type of course is set up in the department.</sentence><sentence id="1731">And while once or twice, under very special conditions, with appropriate paperwork, we got a 16" student in.</sentence><sentence id="1732">But these were never big lecture classes of any sort.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1734">Interview with Gerhard Weinberg = March 13, 2012</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1735">Q: And do you think that Holocaust education is now well established in <span class="BUILDING">American high schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span>, or do you think that interest might wane at some point?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1736">Or, put differently, what challenges do you see for Holocaust education in the future?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1737">A: Well, i-it seems to me, I don't really know enough about secondary education, and I know that it is taught in many insto -- institu -- <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1738">And that in many <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> there are requirements in this <span class="DLF">field</span>, and in many <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> efforts are made to prepare teachers, that is public school teachers, properly, so they can do this.</sentence><sentence id="1739">I do know a little bit ki-- more about the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and university system, and there it is reasonably well established, I would argue, for a couple of reasons.</sentence><sentence id="1740">One of them is that there are many scholars who have worked in the <span class="DLF">field</span>, who accept positions in modern European or modern German history, and who are interested in offering a course on the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1741">And the other side of this, very closely related to this, is that departments who need large numbers of enrollments, to offset courses they need to offer, in things like medieval history, where they're not going to get large numbers of students, but need to offer them, are interested in the fact that Holocaust courses are always filled.</sentence><sentence id="1742">And I know, both from my own PhDs around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and others, that when there is a course offered, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> are filled.</sentence><sentence id="1743">And if you ask, well, why are the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> filled, it is not because these courses are required.</sentence><sentence id="1744">It is -- they are filled because there is a general public interest, and students are interested.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Whether it satisfies a particular degree requirement or not, or can be used as one of a vast number of courses that would fulfill a particular requirement, th-the reality is that the students go to the courses on the Holocaust because they have an interest.</sentence><sentence id="1746">They've heard about this, they want to know something about it.</sentence><sentence id="1747">And if it's offered, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="1748">And the other side of this is that department chairs know that if one of their faculty members is going to offer a course, it's going to be full.</sentence><sentence id="1749">And so, because of the interest out there, not because of a requirement that students take it.</sentence><sentence id="1750">Under those circumstances, I would argue that the <span class="DLF">field</span> is reasonably well established.</sentence><sentence id="1751">That doesn't mean that there are no issues or problems, and I would suggest that the future here depends heavily on faculty members being honest and forthright about a differentiation between the Holocaust and other genocides.</sentence><sentence id="1752">That doesn't mean that one is a hierarchy of better or worse, but what I would argue is a sense of differentia -- differentiation.</sentence><sentence id="1753">And it is in this regard that the issue I just alluded to, that is to say where I differ with many in this, the concept of a worldwide killing program.</sentence><sentence id="1754">All other genocides of which we know, are geographically defined.</sentence><sentence id="1755">The Turks wanted to kill Armenians in <span class="COUNTRY">Armenia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1756">They had not the slightest interest in Armenians who had emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> or the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1757">The UstaSe in World War II <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> wanted to Interview with Gerhard Weinberg (tm) March 13, 2012 kill Serbs who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1758">The fact that there are lots of Serbs living -- or people of Serb descent living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, they assumed they wouldn't like when they hear about this, but there was no particular interest in going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to kill people of Serb background.</sentence><sentence id="1759">One of the major differentiations I would argue, between the Holocaust and all other known forms of genocide, was the concept of a worldwide program.</sentence><sentence id="1760">And I think that in the future, as the time in which the Holocaust occurred, recedes further and further into the past, and other genocides, like the one in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span>, are chronologically seen 50 or a hundred years from now, as being about the same time.</sentence><sentence id="1761">I think that unless those who do work on the Holocaust, both in their research and in their teaching, are ho-honest about differentiations, not that one is worse than another; people are dead whether they are killed in one or the other, but that the conceptualization of this was different, and novel in its own way, as well as the implementation on an industrial scale.</sentence><sentence id="1762">I think that is an issue that the teaching of the Holocaust, at the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and university level in the future, has to -- what to engage, the reality as a future generation of students looks back on a variety of mass killings, none of which was better or worse than the other mass killings, but out of which group, the Holocaust stands apart.</sentence><sentence id="1763">Not above, not below, but apart, in a category by itself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1795">Q: Dr. Weinberg, as you look back on your successful and eventful life, what do you remember as the most exciting moments of your scholarly career?</sentence><sentence id="1796">Like a discovery, recognition and insight, which moment do you remember as particularly exciting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1799">A: Well, I'm not sure that I remember one more than another.</sentence><sentence id="1800">I was very excited when I got my first opportunity to teach at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span>, because I had not had that opportunity before, at a college university level.</sentence><sentence id="1801">I was quite excited when I, in the summer of "58, I looked at what turned out to be not a draft of "Mein Kampf," but this other book of Hitler's which, since I was working on German foreign policy, here was Adolf himself writing on foreign policy.</sentence><sentence id="1802">I thought that that was a very good coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="1803">And I guess the other moment was when my wife Janet took a picture of me at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span>, when I was sending to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span>, in a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crate</span>, two copies of the World War II book manuscript.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1809">Q: And what did you find most rewarding, most gratifying in being a scholar and a teacher?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1811">A: The response of students.</sentence><sentence id="1812">I like my students, even the ones that didn't do so well.</sentence><sentence id="1813">But I like getting a sense of looking at students while I was speaking, when their faces sort of lit up a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1814">Oh, I get that.</sentence><sentence id="1815">And I was very pleased to have a succession of graduate students who moved forward in their graduate work, and Interview with Gerhard Weinberg March 13, 2012 none of whom is unemployed today.</sentence><sentence id="1816">And a--a majority of whom went into academic careers, but a substantial number into other careers in the government, and in archives.</sentence><sentence id="1817">And that is always very interesting, because of course, they learn more about the subject they're working on than I ever had learned.</sentence><sentence id="1818">And it was very interesting to have this combination of individuals, and their -- their relationship with me, both then and after they had finished, a-and to see other people make new discoveries, this -- find new connections, and then go forth into the world -- the academic or the government world, and make successful careers for themselves.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1828">Q: Is there anything you wish to add to this interview?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: Well, perhaps I should mention the two monuments that aren't up, that I think should be up.</sentence><sentence id="1831">One monument should be up in ger -- or at least plaque should be up in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the other in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1832">Eng -- 1955, the Austrian state treaty provided for an independent <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and the allied occupation troops to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1833">When the American occupation troops left their <span class="REGION">zone</span> [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1834">And in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that they had ta -- the Americans had taken over from the Germans, they found a bunch of records.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And those records, it turned out, were the records of the <span class="REGION">area</span>, military area district horse draft board.</sentence><sentence id="1836">We forget today that in Europe, until World War, and into World War II, governments drafted not just people, but also horses.</sentence><sentence id="1837">The question then arose, what's to be done with these Interview with Gerhard Weinberg ia March 13, 2012 records?</sentence><sentence id="1838">The Austrians said, well, these were Austrian horses, and the records were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, and the records should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, and if the Germans want to look at them, they're welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1839">And the Germans said, oh, but these are German records, they were created by our agency, the horses are all dead.</sentence><sentence id="1840">The records should go to the <span class="BUILDING">military archive</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freiburg</span>, and if the Austrians want to use them, they're welcome.</sentence><sentence id="1841">When there are legal questions in the American military, they go to the Judge Advocate General's office in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pentagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1842">And the lawyers there decided uh-uh, these are American records, they go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1843">Which is what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1844">But because they were American records, they naturally fall under American archive law.</sentence><sentence id="1845">And that meant, among other th -- two things.</sentence><sentence id="1846">Number one, that American privacy rules would apply to them, and we applied them in our microfilming.</sentence><sentence id="1847">But it also means that there would be the system of records disposal.</sentence><sentence id="1848">The the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> would present to a joint committee of <span class="BUILDING">House</span> and Senate, disposal schedules from time to time.</sentence><sentence id="1849">These records go to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>, these records go to the <span class="BUILDING">regional archive</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span>, or wherever.</sentence><sentence id="1850">These records get destroyed, nobody needs them.</sentence><sentence id="1851">These records are sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the federal republic.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And if the congressional joint committee agreed, as I'm informed it generally did, that's how they got there.</sentence><sentence id="1853">And I have therefore been long of the opinion, both orally and in print, that the Germans should put up at least a plaque in Interview with Gerhard Weinberg ia March 13, 2012 honor of the Austrian horses who got them their records back.</sentence><sentence id="1854">Seems to me only reasonable.</sentence><sentence id="1855">The Brits need to put up a plaque, or a monument of some sort, to the Duchess of Windsor, because if she had not, as Wallace Simpson, put her sites on the man, the Prince of Wales who became Edward the eighth, and who abdicated in order to marry her, the British would have been stuck with him, whether he married someone else, or remained unmarried, for the rest of his life.</sentence><sentence id="1856">And sparing the British from having him as king during World War II, is something that I've long argued that people in Great Britain ought to acknowledge by some kind of plaque, or other dedicated thing.</sentence><sentence id="1857">In my own work in the British records, it is very clear that in 1940, thi -- by this time, the Duke of Windsor, because of course, he had abdicated before, and George the sixth was king, and his wife, the Duchess of Windsor were, if not very strongly pro-German, inclined in that direction.</sentence><sentence id="1858">They had no sense of what really was going on in the world.</sentence><sentence id="1859">And at a time when <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was being assaulted from the <span class="DLF">air</span>, their main concern was the fate of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">Paris apartment</span>, and whether one of his junior aids could get an exemption from the British draft.</sentence><sentence id="1860">They shipped him off to the <span class="COUNTRY">Bahamas</span>, but this was not the kind of person that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> needed in its great hour of need, and people tend to forget that George the sixth, who became king and was king through the whole war, into the beginning of the 50s, when he died, was a man who had then, on a British This was somebody who had a connection to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, it was thought that Edward the eighth never did have.</sentence><sentence id="1861">And so, since she was the one who took the initiative to arrange -- or have it arranged, let me put it that way, that George the sixth became king, I think the Brits owe him one -- owe her one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
