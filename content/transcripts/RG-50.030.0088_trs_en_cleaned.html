id="198">Drive the horse, and then we were already in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, and then we</sentence><sentence id="200">stopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people and, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and they said we should go closer to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="201">And they took him out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">And I said, how can you leave them by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>?</sentence><sentence id="203">And he said, I made arrangements to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> because the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, the Russian Army was a little bit more organized.</sentence><sentence id="204">It could start to fight back.</sentence><sentence id="205">It made like a <span class="REGION">zone</span> to fight back, and we left them there.</sentence><sentence id="206">My father didn't want to leave the man.</sentence><sentence id="207">After all, he didn't know him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and my father said, don't do it.</sentence><sentence id="208">You'll kill him.</sentence><sentence id="209">And anyway we left him by the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and we started going farther.</sentence><sentence id="210">We are already -- my father and my brother and my mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he keep it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with him, and this he took with him.</sentence><sentence id="211">We are going there and then nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvian</span>, is different, similar but different.</sentence><sentence id="212">My mother didn't speak <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't.</sentence><sentence id="213">Then he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="214">You are one of them.</sentence><sentence id="215">The Germans were not even there yet.</sentence><sentence id="216">We didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="217">And go there, make a left and a right there.</sentence><sentence id="218">And there was a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and there was a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="219">Maybe he can give you directions.</sentence><sentence id="220">Anyway, we came over there.</sentence><sentence id="221">He had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and two sons and all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this.</sentence><sentence id="222">And there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very nice man.</sentence><sentence id="223">And my father said to him, what should we do?</sentence><sentence id="224">And he said, I am in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> like you are.</sentence><sentence id="225">The war was going on.</sentence><sentence id="226">We didn't know how long it was going to go.</sentence><sentence id="227">So stay with us for a while.</sentence><sentence id="228">And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>, maybe a quarter of a mile.</sentence><sentence id="229">And my father said to him, maybe we could go over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">But we couldn't.</sentence><sentence id="231">He wanted to go over.</sentence><sentence id="232">The reason -- I skipped a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="233">The reason we came to this 10 <span class="NPIP">place</span>, he wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">The Russian go over to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">There was <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and the Russian Army exploded the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> because -- then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the army.</sentence><sentence id="236">Their own people.</sentence><sentence id="237">There was a lot of Jewish, and on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>, we were lucky not to make the time on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span>.</sentence><sentence id="238">If we were on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we would be exploded too.</sentence><sentence id="239">Right before our eyes we saw the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants, really.</sentence><sentence id="240">With their rifles and they couldn't even walk.</sentence><sentence id="241">They got on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">We remained on our <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the people on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, there was still the army holding the gun.</sentence><sentence id="243">But a couple days on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> with this man I said to my father, let me see what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="244">And we took the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="245">We really wanted to go over.</sentence><sentence id="246">He said, I can't take anyone right now.</sentence><sentence id="247">I was going in the nighttime.</sentence><sentence id="248">I was not there and my father, said oh, my God, what is going on there?</sentence><sentence id="249">They are fighting with the Germans and and the Jewish and he found out.</sentence><sentence id="250">And they couldn't make it back on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>, but he came back with this man from the <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">And he came back and said, look, he said, it is bad.</sentence><sentence id="252">I am taking my horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and I am going.</sentence><sentence id="253">He had some people that came to him and said, ride it out from the 11 people.</sentence><sentence id="254">And we are left completely alone, and this was like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and</sentence><sentence id="256">he shake hands with him.</sentence><sentence id="257">I got my family and you have yours.</sentence><sentence id="258">I have to go my way.</sentence><sentence id="259">I can't take you where I'm going.</sentence><sentence id="260">We go where we can and then, of course, we made the journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">We were trying to go back from where we came.</sentence><sentence id="262">That's why I said the little horse was like a dog.</sentence><sentence id="263">We didn't know where to go and my father said to him, go horse.</sentence><sentence id="264">He didn't know where to go and he was afraid to ask for directions, things like this.</sentence><sentence id="265">And luckily like I said in the beginning, my father speaks <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span>, and we starting to move back in one little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and , the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="266">And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are moving slowly.</sentence><sentence id="267">And then all of a sudden we see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> with soldiers and oh, my father said, we are already under the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="268">We caught from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="269">We are going.</sentence><sentence id="270">My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the horse and made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he hide the tallis that he had.</sentence><sentence id="271">We are going there and people are greeting us.</sentence><sentence id="272">People thought we are going from one , from one little 12 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">We are going back to where we go back to from there we went to

<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of ____ and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="279">And we are five going farther than them.</sentence><sentence id="280">We are going farther and they are going backwards.</sentence><sentence id="281">And they kept on saying in German , things like this.</sentence><sentence id="282">We knew how to speak German too and, of course, my father knew we are all right.</sentence><sentence id="283">But of course, my father knew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar.</sentence><sentence id="284">But in this experience we are going down to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, a bag to grab it and saw it on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and it exploded.</sentence><sentence id="285">It was like a bomb.</sentence><sentence id="286">They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they didn't care.</sentence><sentence id="287">They were soldiers but when we came in to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- and we are still in and someone from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> up from the top, what are you doing?</sentence><sentence id="288">Someone will

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2777">Q: You were describing this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>, this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2779">A: Right.</sentence><sentence id="2780">They are building up, of course, coming in with big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and filling it up and soften up and build.</sentence><sentence id="2781">You go up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and then when this was done, they put like a little layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks.</sentence><sentence id="2782">All that was maybe a mile was metal that was maybe two or three foot long, all over.</sentence><sentence id="2783">You couldn't pass by and then in the machinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and there was machinery coming in with for other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2784">And we had to stay with and build all this, like stages, like <span class="DLF">steps</span> and push away the <span class="DLF">gate</span> then run down.</sentence><sentence id="2785">They started from the and they made the <span class="DLF">gates</span> from wood and, of course, they doing this and filled up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and made the other up and build up and they build up maybe four or five foot <span class="DLF">ditch</span>, and they cover up the whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> with cement.</sentence><sentence id="2786">And then they came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machinery</span> and start digging up and move away the farther away and start digging in two or three foot.</sentence><sentence id="2787">It was very deep.</sentence><sentence id="2788">You could see down.</sentence><sentence id="2789">It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they started filling up with cement again.</sentence><sentence id="2790">They made it I would say, the size of this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2791">I would say about 40 foot thick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2792">And when they are doing it they made a downstair and made like <span class="DLF">corridors</span>, and you could walk in the cement and they came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2793">Later on they come bury the whole thing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> stick out just the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and all this cement was built up so heavy.</sentence><sentence id="2794">They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, like a normal <span class="DLF">hill</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2795">Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we had the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time people used to fall in the cement and never came out.</sentence><sentence id="2796">And I think hundreds of people buried.</sentence><sentence id="2797">Almost I fall in there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there.</sentence><sentence id="2798">And my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night time, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it was going on.</sentence><sentence id="2799">I can't even explain the way it was working.</sentence><sentence id="2800">It is like you see a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying.</sentence><sentence id="2801">The guards would say, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group.</sentence><sentence id="2802">Two is missing all the time.</sentence><sentence id="2803">Every day was dead people there.</sentence><sentence id="2804">And there was the work we are doing there and when we had the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> down.</sentence><sentence id="2805">And this and they came to start from the beginning and came with machinery and dig out the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and made another empty <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> answer <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, like you see the dome where they
