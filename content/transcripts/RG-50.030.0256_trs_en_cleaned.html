<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="148">Q: Isee.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="150">A: And then things developed, uh, uh, towards "38.</sentence><sentence id="151">There were quite some difficulties.</sentence><sentence id="152">Uh, also with this movement already, some Nazis started preparing; and there was the talk of a takeover of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">In that time, I start apprentice-time for painting; and it was even noticeable in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">We were forced to obtain religious instruction.</sentence><sentence id="155">And when a priest came in, uh, there was some apprentice what were already over twenty before they got a job.</sentence><sentence id="156">And so they objected to the teaching and, uh, presence of the priest.</sentence><sentence id="157">And some in the background even hailed Hitler in his presence.</sentence><sentence id="158">He was very upset.</sentence><sentence id="159">And then the priest said, "What's wrong with our religion?</sentence><sentence id="160">You have no respect!</sentence><sentence id="161">Ask me questions."</sentence><sentence id="162">And so nobody, uh, want to ask, after, any questions.</sentence><sentence id="163">So I asked the priest, uh, "I would really like, uh, to have some of my questions answered, because, uh, I have some doubts about, uh, that teaching."</sentence><sentence id="164">And he said, "That's what I want!"</sentence><sentence id="165">And so I asked him for a whole hour the different questions.</sentence><sentence id="166">About, for example, the involvement of the war: how it was possible that in the name of the same religion they were placing the Austrians to kill the Italians.</sentence><sentence id="167">And, uh, he said that this was the greatest shame.</sentence><sentence id="168">It should never happen again.</sentence><sentence id="169">And at the end of that hour, he came to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">He said, "It never happened to me that anyone asked so many questions.</sentence><sentence id="171">And, for example, also about if the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> can really claim that they are the only true faith."</sentence><sentence id="172">So he said, "Believe me, I would rather have a handful Catholics what would die for their faith, but not so many millions what only on the paper."</sentence><sentence id="173">And then when he asked where I got this knowledge, uh, of the Bible and, uh, I was able to ask him such questions; so I explained to him that our father teach us from the Bible.</sentence><sentence id="174">And he said, "You are on the right <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">Just continue."</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="202">Q: So what were some of the...the pressures that you began to see from "33 to "38, when Hitler took over [in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>]?</sentence><sentence id="203">What were some of the changes that were taking place in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="206">A: Yes, the changes were a few months later [from] when I had that discussion.</sentence><sentence id="207">Uh, Hitler moved in.</sentence><sentence id="208">And then it became really such a, uh, uh, pressure and change.</sentence><sentence id="209">Uh, people were watched, uh, everything they did.</sentence><sentence id="210">They took account of everyone who did not salute it.</sentence><sentence id="211">And, for example, I had, uh, refused to answer the Hitler greeting.</sentence><sentence id="212">And it took...it took not too long and I was called before, uh, SA group--some of the party informations that I had refused twelve times the greetings.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="220">Q: And what is that greeting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="222">A: Hail Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="223">And so they want to put me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">But the master painter was avoiding, by excusing, uh, me that I should finish my training and that he needs me.</sentence><sentence id="225">And so I got still through without being taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="230">Q: You mean, other people were reporting you?</sentence><sentence id="231">On you, ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="238">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="239">There were, uh, papers asking me to answer with a Hitler greeting.</sentence><sentence id="240">But we explained to him that we never will hail a man.</sentence><sentence id="241">That this only belongs to our Creator, Jehovah God.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="247">So then all of this took place when you were still under twenty-one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: That's right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="252">Q: And in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, what age is that--the age of twenty-one?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="254">A: Twenty-one, when you are full responsible.</sentence><sentence id="255">Uh, like, uh, when you are called in the services, in the army.</sentence><sentence id="256">Then you are full responsible.</sentence><sentence id="257">But not before.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="262">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="263">OK.</sentence><sentence id="264">So then in the year 1938, when Hitler finally took over, what were the things that began to happen to you and to your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="268">A: Yes, the first thing was that they called my father for registration.</sentence><sentence id="269">And in 1939 already, before the Polish War started and, uh, at that Commission, they said it was visible that my father was a invalid, partly from the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="270">He suffered [sublalian (ph)] arthritis; he lost all his teeth right in that time.</sentence><sentence id="271">And then they said, uh, he should be left alone and sent back, because he had enough from the First World War.</sentence><sentence id="272">But then there was some question put to him by some of the German officers.</sentence><sentence id="273">And he said that it would be also against his conscience as one of Jehovah's Witnesses to have anything to do with war.</sentence><sentence id="274">And despite that he was not eligible for war service, they kept him there.</sentence><sentence id="275">He was transferred in, uh, <span class="BUILDING">military jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">And there, uh, he had to wait about three months, uh, [to] be transferred from the, uh, <span class="BUILDING">Vienna Army jail</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">And there he was put before the <span class="BUILDING">War Court</span>, the Reichskriegsgericht [Ger: <span class="BUILDING">State War Court</span>]; and there, he was sentenced with about twenty- eight other Witnesses to death.</sentence><sentence id="278">In the meantime, some of the town[s] people and the former mayor, uh, put up a petition; and, uh, they were signed by most of the people.</sentence><sentence id="279">Even some Nazis sent in letters of recommendations.</sentence><sentence id="280">And this was all ignored.</sentence><sentence id="281">And the one who had started that petition was nearly put to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="282">And they warned him not to do anything like that anymore.</sentence><sentence id="283">There were still people favored; and they liked my father.</sentence><sentence id="284">In that letter was stated he was an example for the community, that he was a very loving neighbor and that he helped everyone.</sentence><sentence id="285">But this didn't help anything.</sentence><sentence id="286">They beheaded him.</sentence><sentence id="287">And it is really a coincidence that today is that very day.</sentence><sentence id="288">The 7th December of 1935 [1939]--fifty years since my father was beheaded.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="310">Q: You mean, 1939?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="312">A: Yes, 1939.</sentence><sentence id="313">On the 7th...7th of December; that's right.</sentence><sentence id="314">Today [is] fifty years since that date.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Now, did you mention before that your two brothers were also there as well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, at that time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: Uh, no.</sentence><sentence id="321">At...at that time, uh, there were some other, uh, uh, Witnesses from, uh...some from that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">But my... was put uh, uh...three months later, uh, I was called up in the work services [NB: Arbeitsdienst].</sentence><sentence id="323">But my second oldest brother [Gregor Jr.] was, uh, called, after he became twenty-one, uh, to the air force [NB: Luftwaffe].</sentence><sentence id="324">And he took the stand of one of Jehovah's Witnesses; and he was sentenced to death.</sentence><sentence id="325">And they waited nearly five months with the execution.</sentence><sentence id="326">Because, uh, everyone had the chance to sign a form that he is not following anymore Jehovah's Witnesses; and also, that he breaks, uh, his oath to Jehovah God and is willing to serve Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="327">My father had one month time.</sentence><sentence id="328">And my brother--twenty- two year old brother--had two...uh, five months time; but he did not, uh, sign the paper.</sentence><sentence id="329">But this were ...this was very hard for him.</sentence><sentence id="330">I had the occasion to meet one of the <span class="BUILDING">barbers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">He [the barber] was transferred from the <span class="INT_SPACE">execution chamber</span> of uh...to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">And he was, uh, cutting his hair and shaving him.</sentence><sentence id="333">And he noticed that I had the same name; and he remembered that this was my brother what he was, uh, serving there in that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">And he said it was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="335">He had, day and night, heavy chains on their arms and weights on their legs before the execution.</sentence><sentence id="336">Day and night.</sentence><sentence id="337">They only were taken off during mealtime, or when they used the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="356">Q: What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or the <span class="NPIP">place</span> your brother was at, before he was executed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="358">A: This was...most were executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>--in [the] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pletzensee</span>, where thousands were executed.</sentence><sentence id="359">And some were executed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span>, also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="360">And some were executed in other <span class="NPIP">places</span>; like, uh, from our congregation there were different ones.</sentence><sentence id="361">Uh, even some were gassed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="366">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="367">Well, since Jehovah's Witnesses were such a small group, why was Hitler interested in killing them or destroying them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="370">A: Yes, uh, because of their firm stand that they were staying neutral and not taking part in Hitler's, uh, goal to rule the world.</sentence><sentence id="371">And they feared if more people would take that stand, so it would be very damaging.</sentence><sentence id="372">And that's why it came up, uh, even in all the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">For example, Pastor Niemieller* was saying in that connection, after the war in one of his big * Martin Niemeller was head of the anti-Nazi Confessing Church from 1937.</sentence><sentence id="374">He was interned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.767083" long="13.261825">Sachsenhausen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>--usually in solitary confinement--until liberated by the Americans in 1945.</sentence><sentence id="375">gatherings, "If we had taken the stand with the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> as true Christians, Hitler could have never gone that far.</sentence><sentence id="376">And there's no excuse.</sentence><sentence id="377">Because many are saying, today, "We were forced to take part in that war.</sentence><sentence id="378">We were forced by Hitler."</sentence><sentence id="379">He said--Pastor Niem6ller-- "We have seen a group of Christians which were not only giving up their freedom.</sentence><sentence id="380">Many were giving up their lives, to keep faith alive in those dark days.</sentence><sentence id="381">These were Jehovah's Witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="382">And if they were able do it, we could have done it."</sentence><sentence id="383">And the same comment made even, uh, before, by Chancellor Adenauer" in a letter, according to Der Spiegel.</sentence><sentence id="384">And Eisenhower, where he said the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> had a great responsibility in the concen...on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="385">If they had spoken up, Hitler could have never, uh, be able to bring about these terrible things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="405">Q: Now, why was it that they beheaded, uh, your father and brother and other Jehovah's Witnesses, instead of just shooting them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="407">A: Yes, they did, uh, shoot only, uh, two brothers I know from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="408">But, uh, it was then changed, because they were not worth it being executed.</sentence><sentence id="409">This was a honorable way of execution.</sentence><sentence id="410">And beheading was dishonorable.</sentence><sentence id="411">This was the reason.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="417">Q: I see.</sentence><sentence id="418">OK, so then that's what happened to your family.</sentence><sentence id="419">Now, what happened to your two brothers who were young?</sentence></p></dialogue>
