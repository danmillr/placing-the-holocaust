<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3028">A: And then, yes, we were -- then I could move out of those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3029">That was already a

bread, I shared mine with her.</sentence><sentence id="3044">If I didn't have any more to eat, naturally it was the other way around.</sentence><sentence id="3045">So that already helped.</sentence><sentence id="3046">And then as our rations -- as we worked harder and harder, the rations became better and better.</sentence><sentence id="3047">We had what was called <span

something.</sentence><sentence id="3049">But it meant a little more bread and a little more soup, and extra coffee.</sentence><sentence id="3050">And then things were not so bad

worried about daily calls to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Auschwitz transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3058">That was the big, big Sword of Damocles that was always hanging over.</sentence><sentence id="3059">And yet we were young.</sentence><sentence id="3060">We were 20, 21 years old.</sentence><sentence id="3061">We weren't too badly off.</sentence><sentence id="3062">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to sleep in.</sentence><sentence id="3063">We had some food.</sentence><sentence id="3064">We had some admirers.</sentence><sentence id="3065">What more do you want at 21?</sentence><sentence id="3066">So we kind of sailed along, and we did our work.</sentence><sentence id="3067">I went a lot, by the way, to that, to that <span

able to help her out in turn a little bit with my little "G-rations" of bread.</sentence><sentence id="3069">And that was good, that was good.</sentence><sentence id="3070">And I met other old people there.</sentence><sentence id="3071">The old people were hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="3072">They had nothing to live for.</sentence><sentence id="3073">And they didn't work, so they had very poor

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3564">And were the pairings among men and women that weren't marriage, for instance, that were love affairs, were they always love affairs, or was that because the men had access to things that the women needed?</sentence><sentence id="3565">In other words, were they not always just straight forward not that love is straight forward?</sentence><sentence id="3566">Do you know what I mean?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3567">A: I don't quite see what you're asking me.</sentence><sentence id="3568">Are you asking me if the kind of friendship I had with Eva, I could also observe between two men?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3575">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="3576">I'm wondering if I'm at all able to answer that because I had no insight into where the men lived, but I would think "yes."</sentence><sentence id="3577">I would think they formed very close camaraderie as well.</sentence><sentence id="3578">How else could they survive?</sentence><sentence id="3579">So I would think the question of that must be "yes," but I wouldn't know from any personal experience.</sentence><sentence id="3580">Now what was the other part of the question?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3591">A: That's a good question, and I have often been asked that.</sentence><sentence id="3592">I did not observe it while I was there, but since then I have read a lot about it.</sentence><sentence id="3593">But I don't think that there was because the Nazis were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the Jews -- strictly.</sentence><sentence id="3594">And if anything like that occurred, it wasn't only the Jew that was punished, the Nazi was punished as well.</sentence><sentence id="3595">But I have since then heard so much of that, that I'm wondering if I was just not aware of it.</sentence><sentence id="3596">But I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="3597">It certainly wasn't so that I could observe it.</sentence><sentence id="3598">The Nazis and Jews were strictly separated.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4739">We were looked over.</sentence><sentence id="4740">We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was, "Did any one of your family ever die in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, or was sent away to the East?"</sentence><sentence id="4741">And we had nobody, you see.</sentence><sentence id="4742">So we could say ""no."</sentence><sentence id="4743">And then we saw him write down that we could get into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4744">And then the next day -- this was all packed into two days, you see.</sentence><sentence id="4745">There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any kind.</sentence><sentence id="4746">So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that we should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase -- no bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind -- and nicely dressed and punctual.</sentence><sentence id="4747">The Germans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your death, you be punctual.</sentence><sentence id="4748">So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement room</span>, and we really didn't believe we were really going to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4749">We did believe something was different.</sentence><sentence id="4750">And in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, it was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> this time, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we got packages of marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with.</sentence><sentence id="4751">And then we left, Eva and I very much together, and we really got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4752">And when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> I remember three things that stayed in my mind very much.</sentence><sentence id="4753">We looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4754">Number one, nobody yelled us, "Get back in or you'll be shot," you know.</sentence><sentence id="4755">And number two, the people smiled.</sentence><sentence id="4756">I hadn't seen a person smile in 12 years.</sentence><sentence id="4757">What was there to smile at?</sentence><sentence id="4758">All through my youth and my growing up.</sentence><sentence id="4759">The people smiled at us.</sentence><sentence id="4760">And the person that -- then some Swiss people in uniform came in and they were nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone in uniform being nice to Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4761">What's this?Gan Eden?(tm) Already we're dead and we're in <span class="NPIP">paradise</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4762">Was unheard of.</sentence><sentence id="4763">And then the third thing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on.</sentence><sentence id="4764">There was no war in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, you see.</sentence><sentence id="4765">The lights purposely stayed on so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> overhead could tell that it was <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and wouldn't bomb it.</sentence><sentence id="4766">But to us it was an epiphany.</sentence><sentence id="4767">It was unheard of.</sentence><sentence id="4768">So then we were allowed to pick one of the several <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we could go, and Eva and I stayed together and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also come, and she followed him to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because she was completely alone.</sentence><sentence id="4769">And I contacted my father, and then he let me come over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I married.</sentence><sentence id="4770">And by gosh when our kids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and J ean(r)" fell in love with Polly" --right under my eyes, and I didn't see it happen.</sentence><sentence id="4771">And I didn't know for many years just how that all came about.</sentence><sentence id="4772">May I tell you just very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="4773">Maybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I discovered it myself.</sentence><sentence id="4774">It wasn't told to me.</sentence><sentence id="4775">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4776">I had an advisor, Tim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and read them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of Recha Sternbuch, very religious woman.... I'll condense the story a little bit -- approached %8 Garden of Eden (Hebrew) *(r) Jean Hammel as Polly Haas-Hammel 9 Jean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss -- a former Swiss President.</sentence><sentence id="4777">First she thought she wanted her mother and father to be taken out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4778">Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he had rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out.</sentence><sentence id="4779">And then, she thought, "Why not try to get all the Jews out?"</sentence><sentence id="4780">It was late in the war, and she asked him to contact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a certain ransom he would let the Jews out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4781">And by gosh he agreed.</sentence><sentence id="4782">This is now, of course, I'm condensing this very much.</sentence><sentence id="4783">He agreed.</sentence><sentence id="4784">Musy went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to meet him first in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad car</span>, then at another secret location, and he agreed.</sentence><sentence id="4785">And I saw the correspondence between him and -- Himmler and Musy -- and then later with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sternbuch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4786">He wanted first -- first he wanted <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span>, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to continue the war, but the Americans of course didn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="4787">In the meantime <span class="BUILDING">Sternbuch</span> had contacted the Va'ad Ha-Hatsala, which is the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4788">And they had formed this Va'ad, just for the purpose of helping the Jews -- the war was ending -- whom they knew would come and needed help, even in Europe.</sentence><sentence id="4789">And when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sternbuch</span> contacted them, they immediately agreed to collect money to buy out the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="4790">In the end, the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to be of twelve hundred people out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, because we still looked good, and as I have said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come.</sentence><sentence id="4791">And then Hitler -- and the condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and American press.</sentence><sentence id="4792">Why?</sentence><sentence id="4793">Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly before him.</sentence><sentence id="4794">After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to whitewash himself.</sentence><sentence id="4795">He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended.</sentence><sentence id="4796">And this was done without Hitler's knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="4797">And Hitler heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="4798">When the first 1,200 Jews came out, he heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="4799">And he immediately disinherited Himmler.</sentence><sentence id="4800">Himmler had to flee, and he forbade every other contact -- every other release -- Jews or non-Jews -- nobody leaves <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="4801">So we were the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4802">And Musy, who it is believed enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity.</sentence><sentence id="4803">Nobody heard from him.</sentence><sentence id="4804">Then he died.</sentence><sentence id="4805">He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse with Himmler.</sentence><sentence id="4806">But he died later.</sentence><sentence id="4807">Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later --in "71.</sentence><sentence id="4808">And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him -- and he wandered around Liineburger Heide which is a place --a lonely place in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and then he had to flee from the Allies.</sentence><sentence id="4809">It was the English -- the British that captured that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4810">And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took cyanide and killed himself.</sentence><sentence id="4811">And then they knew it was Himmler.</sentence><sentence id="4812">It was too late.</sentence><sentence id="4813">And I was saved.</sentence><sentence id="4814">He tried to save himself and he saved me instead.</sentence><sentence id="4815">Isn't that a miracle?</sentence><sentence id="4816">I was number 1,400-- number 1,174 out of those 1,200.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="5199">Q: What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5201">A: Well, two things -- one egotistical and the other altruistic.</sentence><sentence id="5202">The egotistical first.</sentence><sentence id="5203">I got myself an education.</sentence><sentence id="5204">I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5205">My husband, my husband was always very understanding of me.</sentence><sentence id="5206">He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could.</sentence><sentence id="5207">And by then -- this took a while.</sentence><sentence id="5208">My first depression occurred after my first baby was born.</sentence><sentence id="5209">And then I still was very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that was in authority "cause that was dangerous up "til then.</sentence><sentence id="5210">So then after a while I missed very much that I didn't have an education.</sentence><sentence id="5211">And after a while then I went to <span class="BUILDING">Bates College</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span>, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students.</sentence><sentence id="5212">See now, this is different.</sentence><sentence id="5213">This was in the "50s -- in the "60s.</sentence><sentence id="5214">I graduated in "71.</sentence><sentence id="5215">I was only the second person of non-- of not eighteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="5216">I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright.</sentence><sentence id="5217">I graduated with a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it.</sentence><sentence id="5218">And then I was done.</sentence><sentence id="5219">And then I didn't know what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, "Go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5220">Become a librarian," "cause I liked books.</sentence><sentence id="5221">And I did that and again I graduated, so now what?</sentence><sentence id="5222">So he said, "Take a job.</sentence><sentence id="5223">Be a librarian."</sentence><sentence id="5224">And <span class="BUILDING">Bates College</span> took me as a librarian, and I was very happy there during the years.</sentence><sentence id="5225">And then the second part comes in -- the altruistic part if I may say so.</sentence><sentence id="5226">Then I began to realize <span class="BUILDING">Bates College</span>, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college.</sentence><sentence id="5227">When my husband became college physician in -- soon after our marriage, in the early "50s, he was only the second Jewish employee of that whole <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> was in existence for some 150 years or so -- and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities.</sentence><sentence id="5228">And they didn't know Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="5229">So an opportunity presented itself, ready made, and I stepped in.</sentence><sentence id="5230">I got myself funding from the National Humanities Counsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the <span class="BUILDING">College</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5231">I did programs of Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people could hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves, "What is Judaism?</sentence><sentence id="5232">What are Jews?</sentence><sentence id="5233">What are the finer points of it?"</sentence><sentence id="5234">And really, I was quite successful.</sentence><sentence id="5235">I got a <span
