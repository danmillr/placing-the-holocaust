<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="318">Q: Has to change, has to change.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="320">A: And what I will like that you cannot really say why and in which point this change appears.</sentence><sentence id="321">It's _ + change.</sentence><sentence id="322">He's very ambiguous about what he's doing, and because he's not intellectual, he doesn't have he's very simple man.</sentence><sentence id="323">And, you know, a lot of reason why he decides in this very moment to do what he's doing.</sentence><sentence id="324">But it can change the minute later, so he's like somebody who is who is walking on the rope, the wire, and he can slip in any moment of the side of the good or bad.</sentence><sentence id="325">And in some <span class="NPIP">point</span>, in some <span class="NPIP">point</span> I think he feels and it's because also he wants to look at himself as he is smart or that he can be successful, he does something well.</sentence><sentence id="326">So he feels sometimes the weight of the responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="327">And I think that responsibility has left.</sentence><sentence id="328">That in some way the moment when you are responsible for somebody, it's something which is which created this strong attachment.</sentence><sentence id="329">And for him it becomes a kind of obsession.</sentence><sentence id="330">In some ways he is obsessed by that, like the gambler, you know, at some point he's acting in irrational way.</sentence><sentence id="331">It doesn't make sense what he's doing, you know, it's against his interest.</sentence><sentence id="332">It's against the safety of himself and his family, and also it's against his world of values because no matter for him the Jews, no matter __+ and not __* paid for it, what the __* you know, it means it's interesting to watch it because it's so unpredictable in some way, you know?And I think that it makes this character in some way very real and very symbolic in the same time like, you know, like this kind of the confusion.</sentence><sentence id="333">I think most of the people are going not only during the wartime, but especially in those dangerous circumstances Interview with Agnieszka Holland 12 through the process of the confusion.</sentence><sentence id="334">And at sometimes who decide to do something just by chance, something good, the mystery of the good, you know, how the people are doing acting altruistic.</sentence><sentence id="335">It's quite easy to understand why they're acting in a terrible way, why they are cruel, why they are murderers, but why they are good, you know, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="336">It is a mystery so, you know, explore this mystery with a character, which is not angelic at all.</sentence><sentence id="337">It's interesting.</sentence><sentence id="338">And also the _+ the people are all stereotypes.</sentence><sentence id="339">He's watching of the Jews in a very stereotype of way, and he expresses it through his language, but the Jews watch him in the same way, you know?</sentence><sentence id="340">They don't watch him as a human being, you know, so they are both in some way mirroring this kind of the judges.</sentence><sentence id="341">And it's very difficult and complicated and it's so much when it breaks.</sentence><sentence id="342">And when it breaks down, suddenly they are naked, you know, they are standing naked Jews standing like, you know, next to the naked __ and they are like looking into the mirror, you know, I thought that, you know that it's actually very touching without being, you know, emotionally judgmental or something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="368">Q: Wow.</sentence><sentence id="369">Another word pops into my head and that's victim and how do you define a victim?</sentence><sentence id="370">How do you how do victims define themselves?</sentence><sentence id="371">And when they have competitions as to who is the greater victim, and who owes whom?</sentence><sentence id="372">And they are often tied in with stereotypes.</sentence><sentence id="373">It also gets expressed in times of extreme what's the word I'm searching for?</sentence><sentence id="374">When life is so extreme, where you may lose life, when you really are a victim, you know, the associate, the one who says I'm not going to take part in this anymore is ends up being an innocent victim.</sentence></p></dialogue>
