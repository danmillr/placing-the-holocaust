<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="4">Uh Bea, we've started.</sentence><sentence id="5">Would you tell us your name please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: I'm uh Beatrice Pappenheimer, but I was born Beate Stern.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="11">Q: Where and when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> uh is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was uh October 1932.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Tell me about your parents and your family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="19">A: OK.</sentence><sentence id="20">My family consisted of my parents and I have a sister who is three years younger than I am, and at that time we had an uncle living with us.</sentence><sentence id="21">He was uh about nineteen years old.</sentence><sentence id="22">He was still going to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and also uh my grandmother lived with us.</sentence><sentence id="23">And this is, this was our family unit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: Tell me about your childhood, before it became really bad.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: OK.</sentence><sentence id="32">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> it was still mostly peaceful.</sentence><sentence id="33">Uh the only thing that I remember was that my uncle used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and he used to have uh many arguments going on with my father, because my uncle would say, I can see the hand- writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">I see what's coming.</sentence><sentence id="35">Let's get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="36">My father, he was an orthodox Jew.</sentence><sentence id="37">He had a lot of faith.</sentence><sentence id="38">He had faith in <span class="NPIP">God</span>.</sentence><sentence id="39">He had faith in people, and he thought, well, Hitler then...Hitler as much as what he's doing and what we're hearing, he's not going to get away with it.</sentence><sentence id="40">And also probably he thought what am I going to do ina different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, even <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, where things were pretty tough.</sentence><sentence id="41">He didn't speak any language but German.</sentence><sentence id="42">He was in business.</sentence><sentence id="43">He had a <span class="BUILDING">textile business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">We owned a little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> but he was on the <span class="DLF">road</span> most of the time and my mother was in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span>.</sentence><sentence id="45">Uh as a matter of fact, I remember this because my grandmother used to take care of me.</sentence><sentence id="46">I, I think in those days I used to know my grandmother better than I knew my mother.</sentence><sentence id="47">As a matter of fact, I often think of my parents being very modern, today's parents like, because they both worked.</sentence><sentence id="48">My father had had a university education and I was taken care of by the grandmother.</sentence><sentence id="49">And uh then the other thing that I remember was that uh there was talk about a cousin dying.</sentence><sentence id="50">And I remember I had nightmares about that for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="51">I was scared.</sentence><sentence id="52">That was the first time I knew what it was like to be scared of death, of something unknown.</sentence><sentence id="53">Uh that was my earliest recollection.</sentence><sentence id="54">I also...1 remember playing dead.</sentence><sentence id="55">Uh I would lay down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room floor</span> and I would cross my hands over my chest and say to Grandma, I'm dead.</sentence><sentence id="56">So there was talk about people, I remember, even disappearing and dying, even that early.</sentence><sentence id="57">The next thing that I remember - one day my parents came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they were all agitated and uh the reason for it was they had to go and register somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="58">And I remember something about that the men were called <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>...they had a name and the women's name was Sara."</sentence><sentence id="59">But my parents were terribly upset.</sentence><sentence id="60">They didn't like the idea that they had to give their names and addresses and occupation and I think also what it was they had to have permission to uh move.</sentence><sentence id="61">If they want to move out if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span>, they had to get permission, and that upset them to no end, and we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> until about 1936 when my father had to give up his <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and they also had to give up the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because Jews were not allowed to have any, hold any property anymore.</sentence><sentence id="62">So then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">One of the reasons we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was because my uh father had a brother and his family was living there.</sentence><sentence id="64">I think so.</sentence><sentence id="65">And that...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was a_ big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, compared to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span>, but we had had a nice sized <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> it was a different story.</sentence><sentence id="67">When we first came there we moved into with my uh aunt and uncle and their three children, and they just had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, so I remember us being five children in one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">And we had a wonderful time as children but at the same time it was bedlam.</sentence><sentence id="69">And my uh... remember my father and my uncle both trying to find us an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">Well, that was very very difficult already in those days because many people wouldn't, if you were a Jew they wouldn't rent you an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">They weren't allowed to.</sentence><sentence id="72">But finally my father found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> above a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and I think...well, this is the picture that I showed you that I have a picture from.</sentence><sentence id="73">And uh it was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> compared to the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span> which consisted of three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">The <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and we shared it with other families but we had a a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened from the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, so that was the main <span class="DLF">entrance</span> and on the left side was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and on the right hand side was was the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">And there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> I was old enough I had to start going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">And uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was very very different than what we have here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="77">There were all man teachers.</sentence><sentence id="78">They were uh going by the uh Nazi theories and we had to learn how to say "Heil Hitler" and we had to uh we were taught Nazi theories.</sentence><sentence id="79">I don't remember much of that.</sentence><sentence id="80">I just remember mostly uh that they taught us a tremendous amount in one year, but they were extremely strict.</sentence><sentence id="81">It was perfectly alright for the teacher to hit you, and uh for the girls, I remember we had to go up to the front of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> of the teacher, and it was always on a <span class="DLF">platform</span>, and we would hold our hands out like so, the tips of our fingers, and he would take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tuler</span> and hit our hands that way.</sentence><sentence id="82">For the boys, he could slap them around wherever the hand would fall.</sentence><sentence id="83">We had to sit a certain way.</sentence><sentence id="84">We had to write a certain way.</sentence><sentence id="85">We could not look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and God forbid we should talk to each...to each other, or to the teacher.</sentence><sentence id="86">You were only allowed to talk if the teacher addressed you.</sentence><sentence id="87">So it was completely different, but naturally I didn't realize that until years and years later.</sentence><sentence id="88">Also we didn't like to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, mostly because on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there were other children, not Jewish, who would go after us and yell, dirty Jews, or Christ killer...all kinds of names.</sentence><sentence id="89">They would push us, throw stones at us and we were very afraid and the same thing when we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">Sometimes we would duck into <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">I remember one of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> we used to run into was uh a big <span class="BUILDING">department store</span>, and it had uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalators</span> and that was my first experience with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalator</span>.</sentence><sentence id="92">Uh, yes, the city of * decree August 17, 1938 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was quite modern, and it was a beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">I still remember the <span class="DLF">parks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">I still remember the <span class="BUILDING">Schloss</span>, or the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> that we used to go to that was in the <span class="DLF">park</span> and every Sabbath afternoon we would uh just walk around this since we were orthodox, so one of the things you did, in the morning you would go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, in the afternoon you would go to the <span class="DLF">park</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">And talking about <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>, we didn't really have a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="96">We used to have one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lauterbach</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">I remember my father and I going to a regular <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, but in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> for some reason I never went to a regular <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">We went where there was just like an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it was two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> - one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the women and one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the men, and there always had to be a guard in front of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> uh watching the <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so I don't know whether it was you were not allowed to hold services or not, but I just remember the guard.</sentence><sentence id="99">But as children we used to have a good time running around and uh my parents being religious we used to go every Friday and...my father used to go Friday I should say.</sentence><sentence id="100">We used to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, wait for him to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the on Saturday mornings we used to all go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, and it was a religious thing, but I think it was also social because we had a chance to meet with other people then.</sentence><sentence id="101">Uh we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there for about a year, and then Hitler closed all the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> to Jewish children."</sentence><sentence id="102">We were not allowed to attend the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> anymore.</sentence><sentence id="103">And after that my father tried to teach us as much as possible.</sentence><sentence id="104">Uh I remember as we used to uh sometimes go for a walk with one of my parents or with both of them, we used to see signs in front of <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> saying Juden verboten.</sentence><sentence id="105">Not only uh <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> but also <span class="BUILDING">public buildings</span> and even <span class="DLF">parks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">And our lives became more and more restricted.</sentence><sentence id="107">Uh one day as children we were playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> because that was the only place where we could play, and two Nazis came along and we picked up some little pebbles out of the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> and started throwing those pebbles at them.</sentence><sentence id="108">By then we had a hatred for the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="109">Well, they got tired of the game, and they turned around and they started yelling at us and going after us, and it was just fortunate that we knew the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and the <span class="DLF">alleys</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> a little better than they did.</sentence><sentence id="110">But my mother, she had been watching from the <span class="DLF">living room window</span> and she saw the whole episode and when we came back upstairs she was absolutely furious, and she says, I can't trust you to play <span class="NPIP">outside</span> by yourselves anymore.</sentence><sentence id="111">From now on, either you have to have your father or I along, so that restricted our movement.</sentence><sentence id="112">Uh we used to see parades.</sentence><sentence id="113">We lived uh where there was right opposite from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, there was like a uh public square and there was a tall uh column, you might say, and I don't know uh what it was all about uh but they used to have parades, uh the brown shirts and some of the other Nazi movements, and I as a child, I loved uh listening to the music.</sentence><sentence id="114">I used to love to listen to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parade</span> and the marching, never thinking anything that much of it.</sentence><sentence id="115">I knew my parents were against it, but it sounded so pretty, so I would go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> of our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and look out.</sentence><sentence id="116">And one day my mother came up behind me and she hit me on my behind and she said I don't want you looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">So I couldn't do that anymore.</sentence><sentence id="118">Uh like I say, our lives were very very restricted, plus scary at the same time because I remember my mother saying to my father, now be sure you're back by nig...uh night time.</sentence><sentence id="119">I don't want to have to worry * Jewish children could only go to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span>: Nov., 1938; no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for Jewish children at all: July 1, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="120">about you.</sentence><sentence id="121">And one of the reasons was that uh there were a lot of muggings going on and people just disappearing, so my mother always used to say, be...be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before it's dark, and I remember there were times when my father wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she would pace the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span>, back and forth, back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="122">So life for my parents must have been terribly tough, terribly uncertain and I, I remember the arguments between them a lot uh for one reason or another.</sentence><sentence id="123">Also because uh some of the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> were closed to us it was hard even to know where to get your bread, where to get your food.</sentence><sentence id="124">It was tough.</sentence><sentence id="125">I had one experience that I shall never forget was that one day uh I went over to see my girlfriend, and she lived right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us, and I go upstairs...she lived also in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>...and uh I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="126">The mother opens up the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she's, and she says to me, oh it's you.</sentence><sentence id="127">I don't want you playing anymore here.</sentence><sentence id="128">And she just shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> in my face.</sentence><sentence id="129">And that was the last I saw of this friend.</sentence><sentence id="130">And I gather that she wasn't Jewish, and by then, and I forgot exactly what year it was...could have been probably 1937, "38...they couldn't, they they could not fraternize with you any more, but that hurt.</sentence><sentence id="131">And I still carry that hurt.</sentence><sentence id="132">Uh the next thing that I can tell you about is that uh one night we woke up and there was a lot of commotion in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and as I remembered looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>, I saw fires all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">It was as though the whole city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span> was burning, but I remember saying something...my father was saying uh the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> are burning.</sentence><sentence id="134">They're burning all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">So he quickly got dressed and went downstairs and I remember my mother and my sister and I waiting up for my father to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="136">And he didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">And we waited and we waited all night.</sentence><sentence id="138">He never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="139">We found out...and I don't remember when I found this out, but now I can tell you that he had been taken like a lot of other men that night, rounded up and they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="140">I don't remember how long he was gone, but I shall never forget the day he came back, and at first I didn't know it was him, because the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> opens up and there stands this man...he was bent over.</sentence><sentence id="141">My father had...he was a short man but he had always been quite erect, but that day he was bent over and he had, he was all dirty and there was blood on him and he was shaking.</sentence><sentence id="142">We had one of those old-fashioned uh black wood-burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> right across from the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span>, and when he opened up that <span class="DLF">door</span> he started putting his hands, both hands, on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, and I knew it was hot, so I screamed at him...Pa...and at that same instant, I recognized who he was, and I screamed, Papa, Papa, it's hot.</sentence><sentence id="143">And my screams brought my mother into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she took one look at him and I still remember her raising her hands and quickly going to him and taking him into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">Well my father was sick, I guess, and uh it was lucky I think that my mother had a little bit of nursing experience.</sentence><sentence id="145">Somehow she managed to get him well, because we couldn't call a doctor by then, and uh...but he was never the same after that.</sentence><sentence id="146">I don't think my father found work when we had come to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karlsruhe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">I don't know really what he did, except for one comment.</sentence><sentence id="148">One evening...I 1 1 used to watch him.</sentence><sentence id="149">His hands always hurt him, and one evening I remember we were sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I said to him, how come your hands hurt you so much Father?</sentence><sentence id="150">And he said it's because I'm laying bricks and it's hard work and it hurts my hands.</sentence><sentence id="151">So he must have been maybe put into forced labor and uh he was a brick-layer.</sentence><sentence id="152">He was never the same after that.</sentence><sentence id="153">He stayed around the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> quite a bit and maybe he was hiding.</sentence><sentence id="154">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="155">I don't know to this day how he managed to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">Uh I don't know...some people I know if they paid enough money they were able to get out.</sentence><sentence id="157">Others they escaped.</sentence><sentence id="158">I don't know how he did it.</sentence><sentence id="159">The next thing that I remember is uh that we had bombings.</sentence><sentence id="160">The air raids started.</sentence><sentence id="161">The air raids would start up and we'd go down...first of all we had to pull our shades because we had, there was blackout, so we had to go down...we pulled the shades, went down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and there we huddled in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">It was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, because we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span>, several of them must have been connected so it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">community basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="163">And one of the things that I remember and probably this whole episode I remember because of that...my mother used to tell stories to everyone and one of her stories...I I smile at it today, and whether I believed her or not I don't know, but she would say...see this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">It has a rounded <span class="DLF">roof</span>, and it did.</sentence><sentence id="165">It had a rounded <span class="DLF">roof</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And we were all huddled down there.</sentence><sentence id="167">Some of the children were crying.</sentence><sentence id="168">Some of the older people wringing their hands and saying what's going to become of us, and uh you didn't know whether you would live from one minute to the next.</sentence><sentence id="169">You would hear the bombs falling and it was...it was terribly frightening.</sentence><sentence id="170">And here my mother tells the story...see this <span class="DLF">roof</span> is rounded.</sentence><sentence id="171">If a bomb should fall, it's not going to come through.</sentence><sentence id="172">It's going to roll right off, and I must have laughed at it even at this time, because when ever I think about it, it makes me laugh for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="173">And she would tell all kinds of different stories.</sentence><sentence id="174">She would try to get everybody to sing songs, just anything just to take their minds off just a little bit of of the situation.</sentence><sentence id="175">Then the air raid sirens would blow again and we'd go upstairs.</sentence><sentence id="176">So we got used to that kind of a life uh...nights being interrupted by the sirens.</sentence><sentence id="177">Sometimes even during the day.</sentence><sentence id="178">Then one day...it was late 1939, there was a loud knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">And there stood two Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="180">My mother asked them, what do you want?And they said, don't ask any questions, and they yelled, just go and pack.</sentence><sentence id="181">And my mother said, well, how long are we going to be gone?</sentence><sentence id="182">How much should we pack?</sentence><sentence id="183">And they got angrier and angrier as she asked these questions, and they yelled louder and louder, and finally they said, just go pack enough for two weeks, so my mother goes into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and she starts packing and I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> because I had a doll that I loved very much and I used to take that doll where ever I went, so as I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> one of the Nazis followed me, and I go and pick up that doll and he says, he says to me, and he also gets ahold of my arm and starts shaking me and saying, where you're going you don't need this doll, and I look at him, and to this day I can see that face.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I and I said to him, if I can't have that doll...I thought for some reason that he wanted it...I said to him, if I can't have that doll, you can't have her either.</sentence><sentence id="185">And I take the doll and I threw her down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and her doll...and that doll was made...her face was made out of porcelain and broke into hundreds of pieces, and oh, that it got me so upset.</sentence><sentence id="186">As a matter of fact I was so upset during that whole episode I don't remember my father or my sister.</sentence><sentence id="187">It seemed like the whole thing was played out between my mother and I for some reason, and yet I know they were there, but I don't remember them at all.</sentence><sentence id="188">My mother gets done packing and we're about to go out, and I look around that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I thought to myself...we'll never see it again.</sentence><sentence id="189">And I look at my mother and I said to her as much.</sentence><sentence id="190">I * date uncertain says I don't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="191">They're not going to let us see this <span class="NPIP">place</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="192">And I take ahold of the leg of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen table</span> and I... wouldn't let go of it, and my mother had a terrible time trying to get me out of the <span class="DLF">door</span>, but little by little she calmed me and she managed to get me out.</sentence><sentence id="193">They took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span>, and there there were hundreds of people, lots of people.</sentence><sentence id="194">And you could tell some of them had been waiting there for quite some time, because they were laying on blankets, sitting on the suitcases.</sentence><sentence id="195">There were babies crying.</sentence><sentence id="196">Older people again crying and uh it was just so confusing...everything.</sentence><sentence id="197">We waited, I I forgot for how long, but after a while we lined up and they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">Now it was a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> but we were squeezed in.</sentence><sentence id="199">There were so many of us.</sentence><sentence id="200">And I thought always because there was so many people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I don't know whether they'd slow (ph) or not that that's why the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went very slow.</sentence><sentence id="201">And it did.</sentence><sentence id="202">It went very slow, and especially going around a <span class="DLF">bend</span>.</sentence><sentence id="203">It would really slow down, and because there were so many people, it was very hot and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open so some people thought they would escape and they jumped out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span>, but they didn't realize at first that there were Nazis on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and they had guns and they shot those people as they tried to get away from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, and that was my first experience seeing someone die.</sentence><sentence id="204">I saw some being shot.</sentence><sentence id="205">It was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="206">And people were just...everybody was very excited on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, too.</sentence><sentence id="207">Then after a while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and it was at the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="208">And then there was a voice over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeaker</span> and it said, if you have any money, get rid of it, or at least I thought that's what it said, because my mother, she tried to hide some money on her and and I I was in a terrible state I guess because I saw her doing it and I started screaming at her, which I would never have dared to do under ordin...ordinary circumstances because you had a great great respect for your parents.</sentence><sentence id="209">But I said to her, don't do this.</sentence><sentence id="210">They're going to do something terrible to you, and sure enough, they had said over the loudspeaker that if you disobeyed orders, you would be shot, and so I was just hysterical when I saw her doing that and so she says OK, take the money and flush it down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">So I go take the money and I go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and I flush it down, and I don't think...I don't know how much it was or anything...it was just a handful...and then I came back and I walked through the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> because there they have <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> and I walked through the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> and you can see into the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> and there I saw the Nazis searching people and taking them out into the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> and uh after a while I noticed that they were lining them up on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> outside.</sentence><sentence id="212">Pretty soon I hear the shots and true to their word they were shooting all the people who had tried to hide money on their person.</sentence><sentence id="213">But I didn't see...I just heard the shots...I didn't see anything because my mother took me against her body like and she hid my face against her.</sentence><sentence id="214">Then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on, and like I said, there were so many people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">My mother had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> but I didn't, and after a while I made myself comfortable on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="216">I just sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I remember I had a <span class="DLF">wall</span> to lean against.</sentence><sentence id="217">I remember still seeing a fat lady sitting there and there was an old man and people standing...somebody tall and thin and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on and on.</sentence><sentence id="218">I don't remember...there was no food, nothing to drink, and I missed more not having anything to drink.</sentence><sentence id="219">I became very very thirsty and my throat felt so dry, almost was like getting a sore throat, and I don't remember how many days we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">It just seemed like it went on and on and on and on.</sentence><sentence id="221">I slept some and then suddenly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped and we were able to get out but then they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and I remember still the roughness of those of those Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="222">Sometimes there was an old person who didn't walk fast enough for them, and they would kick him, or they would pull a man's beard or they would hit them with their sticks that they had and always I heard the word, "schnell, schnell", which means quick, quick.</sentence><sentence id="223">Then we were put on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="224">My first sight of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> what...my my...I became just desolate.</sentence><sentence id="225">There was barbed wire all around it and it looked all brown, grey and black.</sentence><sentence id="226">There wasn't any green for grass.</sentence><sentence id="227">There were no leaves on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">It looked so desolate.</sentence><sentence id="229">It looked so sad.</sentence><sentence id="230">We were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then we were separated, the men from the women and we had to say goodbye to my father and the women were taken to a big <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and there they told us to get undressed and this time they looked for gold.</sentence><sentence id="231">We had little bracelets.</sentence><sentence id="232">They took those.</sentence><sentence id="233">My mother, she had pierced earrings.</sentence><sentence id="234">They were round...they were hoop earrings and they pulled those earrings right off her ear lobe.</sentence><sentence id="235">They didn't even give her a chance to take them off.</sentence><sentence id="236">They just pulled them, and I still her, hear her cry out to this day, and I remember her holding her hands like that to her ears.</sentence><sentence id="237">Then they gave us <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> was very light, and I was surprised but the reason why it was so light was because it just contained straw.</sentence><sentence id="238">They assigned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="239">Now my mother and sister and I, we had only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to sleep on.</sentence><sentence id="240">We were about twenty-five to thirty people in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">We had just...there were just <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> but they had like...they were they were frames, wooden frames, chicken wire and then we put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> on.</sentence><sentence id="242">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span>.</sentence><sentence id="243">People tried to have a little privacy.</sentence><sentence id="244">Now I remember them, them hanging up maybe some kind of a rag or cloth, and in each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> there was a scale, and I was, really at first I remember I was wondering what was the scale for.</sentence><sentence id="245">But I had a chance to find out, because everyday they would throw one loaf of bread into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, and they would throw it.</sentence><sentence id="246">The women would go after that loaf of bread.</sentence><sentence id="247">At first it wasn't that bad, but then when you...but then when we became hungrier and hungrier, things became worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="248">And the reason I'm saying this is that we used to have one person to div...to divide up this loaf of bread, and it wasn't very big.</sentence><sentence id="249">It was regular loaf like that.</sentence><sentence id="250">But to divide it up amongst, like I say, twenty-five to thirty people wasn't very easy, and also I never saw any knives, forks or spoons.</sentence><sentence id="251">So one person was selected and she would try and weigh bread as closely as possible so everybody would have the same amount.</sentence><sentence id="252">Didn't always work out that way because it was very difficult to do.</sentence><sentence id="253">So if one person would get just a little bit more, the other women would jump on this person and they would have terrible fights.</sentence><sentence id="254">These women who had been ladies turned like into animals almost, just to have a little bit of more bread, but they were starving us, and when you are that hungry it hurts and you will do almost anything, anything to get just a little bit of bread, or anything.</sentence><sentence id="255">The other thing that they used to give us in the evenings, they used to give us a bowl of soup and the soup consisted of just...it was liquid and it had a little bit of a vegetable in it but one day in my soup I found a little piece of meat.</sentence><sentence id="256">A little piece of meat.</sentence><sentence id="257">I still see it to this day.</sentence><sentence id="258">And I ate that piece of meat and do you know that I can still taste it.</sentence><sentence id="259">I still know what it looks like and do you...nothing in my whole life is every going to taste as good as that little piece of meat.</sentence><sentence id="260">How it found it's way to me I don't know, but that's the only time that I had meat.</sentence><sentence id="261">That's about all that I can remember getting or eating there except my mother worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, so I had dysentery.</sentence><sentence id="262">People got terribly sick with various diseases because the sanitary conditions were non- existent.</sentence><sentence id="263">Like I never saw any running water.</sentence><sentence id="264">The <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that we were staying in, it leaked.</sentence><sentence id="265">So sometimes my mother, she would have a container and she would try and collect as much water as possible and I think we used that for drinking.</sentence><sentence id="266">We used it for various things that we needed, maybe washing off a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="267">I don't remember taking a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span>, <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span>, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="268">We were dirty.</sentence><sentence id="269">We had lice.</sentence><sentence id="270">We had lice in our hair.</sentence><sentence id="271">We had lice on our clothing.</sentence><sentence id="272">And I remember my sister, she had terrible sores because these lice, they made you scratch, and she had sores all over her legs, all over her arms and body, and in the evening my mother would try and take her clothes off but the clothes would stick to the sores and she would cry terribly.</sentence><sentence id="273">The one strange thing that happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was that we used to get uh people from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">A woman would come...I mean it was a lady.</sentence><sentence id="275">She would come.</sentence><sentence id="276">She was from the uh <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross</span>.</sentence><sentence id="277">She would come and as children we'd go to this one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where we used to be able to uh play certain games and she would be there and she would sing songs for us.</sentence><sentence id="278">I remember this because she used to yodel.</sentence><sentence id="279">That's the first time I heard any yodeling.</sentence><sentence id="280">And she would distribute those little triangles of cheese.</sentence><sentence id="281">One piece of cheese per person.</sentence><sentence id="282">Well, it would have been better if she hadn't done it at all because what happened was we were like animals and some of us were stronger than other people and because we were so hungry, terrible fights used to break out again amongst us children.</sentence><sentence id="283">We used to try and get away the cheese from each other, and I...as a matter of fact my sister to this day holds it against me...being older, being stronger than her, I used to grab the cheese away from her, and she oft...she often...that's one of the things she always used to say to me.</sentence><sentence id="284">She says, Bea, how could you have done this to me.</sentence><sentence id="285">I was starving like you.</sentence><sentence id="286">How could you take the cheese.</sentence><sentence id="287">But I did it.</sentence><sentence id="288">I took the cheese away from her and so I don't understand...I never could understand how how how come they did something like that.</sentence><sentence id="289">They knew we were terribly hungry.</sentence><sentence id="290">We were starving.</sentence><sentence id="291">And yet they came and they went back, and they didn't do anything.</sentence><sentence id="292">They they saw the way we were living.</sentence><sentence id="293">And...but that didn't happen too often.</sentence><sentence id="294">I remember maybe two, three times during that time...I was there almost a year...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="564">Q: Which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was this, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bea</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="566">A: This, this was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.288611" long="0.755278">Gurs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="567">And uh it was, it was a terrible thing to do to us and it didn't help us any.</sentence><sentence id="568">By then I, we had been there maybe a year.</sentence><sentence id="569">I was very homesick for my father.</sentence><sentence id="570">Uh and I would, I would listen to grown-up's conversation, and I knew where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man's camp</span> was, and maybe because I listened uh I got it into my head that I want to visit my father, no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="571">I, I...the urge was so strong.</sentence><sentence id="572">I had to see my father.</sentence><sentence id="573">So I told my sister about it.</sentence><sentence id="574">I said I want to see our father, and she says you are absolutely crazy.</sentence><sentence id="575">First of all, they're not going to let you.</sentence><sentence id="576">They'll shoot us before they'll let you do it.</sentence><sentence id="577">I said I don't care.</sentence><sentence id="578">I want to see our father.</sentence><sentence id="579">Will you come with me?</sentence><sentence id="580">Very reluctantly my sister comes with me and I take her hand and we go to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="581">The guard comes out of his <span class="BUILDING">guardhouse</span> and he must have asked where were, where we want to go and I told him.</sentence><sentence id="582">He must have given me a certain amount of resistance.</sentence><sentence id="583">I don't remember the exact conversation, but one thing I remember is that I didn't have any respect for our guards.</sentence><sentence id="584">I wasn't even that scared of them.</sentence><sentence id="585">I just had no respect for them.</sentence><sentence id="586">I felt I was superior to them, and I don't know why, where that feeling even came from.</sentence><sentence id="587">And because of that I think I was able to do what I did, because there we were having a bit of an argument and like I say, I don't remember the exact conversation.</sentence><sentence id="588">The one thing that I remember about it is that I kicked him on his boot and I said to him, "tu sale cochon", which means you dirty pig.</sentence><sentence id="589">And I take my sister's hand and we...I said to her, what ever you do Suzie, don't look back, and we march out of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we, I thought for sure he would shoot us in the back.</sentence><sentence id="590">I really expected it, but he didn't.</sentence><sentence id="591">We marched and we marched and to this day I still can see that <span class="DLF">route</span>.</sentence><sentence id="592">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was very close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="593">You could see the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span>, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> were throwing a shadow over the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and after the shadow I still can see that sun shining and we walked down that <span class="DLF">road</span> and I find the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where the men are, and somebody must have...yeah, somebody did.</sentence><sentence id="594">Somebody took us to my father.</sentence><sentence id="595">I don't remember everything about that visit, but one thing I've never forgotten...just during that time they were giving everyone eggs.</sentence><sentence id="596">Just an egg.</sentence><sentence id="597">And I was so surprised to see an egg, because we had never gotten an egg at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="598">Even in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was very hard to get eggs and I've always loved eggs, so if they were giving each man an egg, I thought ummm....my father surely will share that egg with us.</sentence><sentence id="599">I know he will.</sentence><sentence id="600">My father opens up the egg.</sentence><sentence id="601">So did the other people.</sentence><sentence id="602">It was a raw egg.</sentence><sentence id="603">And I look at my father, and he was shaking for some reason as he was looking at the egg, so I go look at the egg and low and behold there's blood in the egg.</sentence><sentence id="604">Well an orthodox Jew will not eat an egg with blood in it.</sentence><sentence id="605">It's unclean.</sentence><sentence id="606">It's not kosher, but I thought oh, he'll make an exception.</sentence><sentence id="607">He'll, he'll eat some of it and give us some surely.</sentence><sentence id="608">We're starving after all.</sentence><sentence id="609">But my father takes the egg and throws it against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I could hardly believe it, but I look at that yellow ooze running down the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and I thought to myself, I'm going to go lick it before it touches the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>, and I go and run for it, but I made the mistake of turning around as I ran, because I, I knew I was...L..1...what I was doing was not right, and I looked at my father's face and I stopped.</sentence><sentence id="610">I could not do it.</sentence><sentence id="611">My father took us in his arms and we cried together.</sentence><sentence id="612">And I don't...that's something I just could never forget, that even though he was starving, we were starving, he would not eat the egg that had blood in it and therefore not kosher.</sentence><sentence id="613">Uh we got back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> and that's, that was, that's the big thing that I remember about that visit.</sentence><sentence id="614">Then uh my sister who like I say is four years younger than I, she became very weak, very sickly, so one day my mother said it's...I'm going to send Suzie out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so you have to say goodbye to her, and I said goodbye to my sister and I hated it because she was really my best friend and so it was just my mother and I and shortly after that they transferred us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name of Rivesaltes...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="664">Q: Do you know...excuse me...do you know where Suzie went?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="666">A: At that time I did not know where she went.</sentence><sentence id="667">I just knew she...I said goodbye to her and that was it, so then, like I say, we were transferred to the, to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> by the name of Rivesaltes and there it was much the same.</sentence><sentence id="668">The only thing is I must have even gotten hungrier because I remember going into the garbage, so I was in competition with the rats and the mice.</sentence><sentence id="669">As a matter of fact there was talk about the rats being also 0 starving, not having enough food so they used to bite people.</sentence><sentence id="670">I became sick with cholera and uh they put me into like an <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="671">It was a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and I remember there was a <span class="DLF">window</span> with bars on it.</sentence><sentence id="672">One day I see my father's face and I could hardly believe it and I, I must have asked how come they let him come to see me, and he said it's because I'm being transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="673">Well, I didn't think too much of it for some reason uh and I didn't realize that that was the last time that I saw my father, through that <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="674">I got better and then one day my mother came for me, and as we walked back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> I still remember her saying to me, you know it's time that I sent you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="675">Otherwise you won't last much longer.</sentence><sentence id="676">Now my mother, I remember watching her in the evenings when she would get undressed.</sentence><sentence id="677">She was like a skeleton.</sentence><sentence id="678">And also she started coughing.</sentence><sentence id="679">She would cough at night and now I suspect she came down with TB.</sentence><sentence id="680">But I remember the coughing and I remember how skinny she was and also probably she gave us maybe some of the food that she should have eaten.</sentence><sentence id="681">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="682">One day my mother takes me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there were other children and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and then we were loaded up on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="683">I said goodbye to my mother, also not really realizing this would be the last time I would ever see her.</sentence><sentence id="684">We said goodbye and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="685">It was broad daylight.</sentence><sentence id="686">There was this organization called the OSE, Oeuvre de Secours des Enfants and they took out as many children as they could out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and they had <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> across the southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="687">I was moved fourteen different times and uh these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>...they were like <span class="BUILDING">chateaus</span> or big <span class="BUILDING">mansions</span> and we used to be maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty, two hundred children in one of those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="688">They were, they tried to teach us French and also uh give us...they gave us French uh names like I was born Beate and my name name turned into Beatrice.</sentence><sentence id="689">Uh they gave us...we didn't have much schooling.</sentence><sentence id="690">We were really busy trying to, for instance we...to grow vegetables so we would have something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="691">Sometimes we came to these <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="692">They didn't even have enough <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> so the boys would be uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">building furniture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="693">Us girls, we would till the soil so we would have something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="694">They use...they used to teach us how to survive in the, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">Uh what grasses, what weeds to eat because many times we didn't have enough vegetables, so we would eat off the <span class="REGION">land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">Uh we just...we were constantly moving all the time.</sentence><sentence id="697">We did our own cooking.</sentence><sentence id="698">We did our own uh washing of dishes and uh did everything ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="699">I really learned housekeeping in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> you might say.</sentence><sentence id="700">Uh we we learned how to write a little bit more.</sentence><sentence id="701">They always made sure that we would write to our parents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="702">We had older children looking after the younger ones.</sentence><sentence id="703">Uh I received letters from my parents.</sentence><sentence id="704">As a matter of fact I tried to send a package once to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of bread.</sentence><sentence id="705">Uh II hadn't...I... some reason bread became very very important to me and so one day I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I tried to get...I got some bread and I made a package to send to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="706">Whether my mother ever got it or not I have no idea and those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were raided though.</sentence><sentence id="707">And so they used to move us.</sentence><sentence id="708">I remember one night they woke us up and we were moved by uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span>.</sentence><sentence id="709">It was a terrible ride yet at the same time I found it very exciting.</sentence><sentence id="710">At other times we were moved by like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">farmer's cart</span> with hay on top of us, because the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was also occupied and all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were occupied and and a lot of the uh French were Na...Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="711">So we were moved from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other.</sentence><sentence id="712">One day as I came to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, a little girl comes and she brings me a blanket and 1 I look at her, she looks at me, and I thought oh, she looks familiar, and I didn't recognize her right away because she didn't have any hair.</sentence><sentence id="713">Her hair was shaved and she had a bandage, and it took me maybe a couple of seconds to recognize my sister.</sentence><sentence id="714">And I could hardly believe it.</sentence><sentence id="715">It was pure coincidence.</sentence><sentence id="716">It was like a miracle that we found each other.</sentence><sentence id="717">Well we, needless to say, we were overjoyed and we hugged each other.</sentence><sentence id="718">As a matter of fact we would...we wouldn't let go of each other for the longest time.</sentence><sentence id="719">We were quite insecure.</sentence><sentence id="720">I remember being terribly insecure and I used to scratch my he...my head all the time and uh I used to think, what's going to happen to us?</sentence><sentence id="721">What's going to happen to us when the war is over with?</sentence><sentence id="722">Will my parents be alive?</sentence><sentence id="723">Will we find them again?</sentence><sentence id="724">Will we find each other again?</sentence><sentence id="725">But I also learned something during those days, that maybe because the times were so terrible that I learned that what goes on around you is one thing and what goes on within you can be another thing.</sentence><sentence id="726">Because I found myself having perfectly happy moments.</sentence><sentence id="727">And it was a strange revelation.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="790">Q: Tell us about some of those moments.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="792">A I remember once we were, we were in this uh <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and and these moments came all of a sudden, for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="793">I was going down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I was going to be with some other girls and on those <span class="DLF">stairs</span> this happiness comes over me, just like that and I think it was...I was alive.</sentence><sentence id="794">I was able to go down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and it it was, you know, the situation was terrible.</sentence><sentence id="795">I didn't know...at that time I didn't know where my sister was.</sentence><sentence id="796">I didn't know where my parents was, but I was joining a group of friends and for some reason that made me happy and also what was so important in those times was my Jewish identity.</sentence><sentence id="797">It helped me tremendously.</sentence><sentence id="798">I had something in common with other people.</sentence><sentence id="799">And I knew that other Jews were taking care of me and it gave me a sense of family and that was very important and and finding out all of this on my own...nobody telling me this, gave me a sense of security because I knew that within I was alright.</sentence><sentence id="800">The things that were happen...were happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> uh could only touch me if I let them touch me, and this was the most important lesson I think that I've learned in my whole life.</sentence><sentence id="801">Uh and it's true I made also a lot of friends during that time, good friends.</sentence><sentence id="802">Uh and these friends, they helped me an awful lot to get through it and I hope that I was able to help some of these people too.</sentence><sentence id="803">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="804">I did meet up with some later on and we stayed in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> until 194....1943.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="818">Q: Could you...before you move on...could you tell me...you said that you were, you were in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> at one point.</sentence><sentence id="819">Can you tell me a little bit about the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="822">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="823">This is...I'm coming to it. (</sentence><sentence id="824">laughter) So we were in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> until 1943.</sentence><sentence id="825">Well, in 1943 Hitler became even in a bigger hurry to kill all the Jews so these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were bombed.</sentence><sentence id="826">They were not raided anymore.</sentence><sentence id="827">Now this was getting to be serious business, and this organization...what to do with all of these children that they had on their hands.</sentence><sentence id="828">Some of the children went into <span class="BUILDING">private Christian homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="829">Some of us, my sister included, went to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="830">That <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milleau</span> (ph), in the southern central part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="831">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="832">And life in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> was completely different than what we had 2 ever known.</sentence><sentence id="833">As a matter of fact I had hardly given it a thought that I knew some people were Christians, gentiles, but we were used to calling the others but I had never really mixed with anybody especially that was not Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="834">I had lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish world</span>, so this was different.</sentence><sentence id="835">I learned about baby Jesus, for instance.</sentence><sentence id="836">And the story was so appealing to me and what happened was that I became...I thought to myself, this is nice.</sentence><sentence id="837">Why shouldn't I turn Catholic?</sentence><sentence id="838">And I wanted to turn Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="839">I liked the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">The sisters were very very kind.</sentence><sentence id="841">Uh as a matter of fact only one sister really knew that we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="842">The others did not know.</sentence><sentence id="843">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school convent</span> so we learned <span class="BUILDING">catechism</span>.</sentence><sentence id="844">I know a lot about the Catholic religion.</sentence><sentence id="845">We went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="846">It's true we could not ta...partake of communion and I don't know really how they got around that, but we did not take communion but we did everything otherwise what the other Christian children did.</sentence><sentence id="847">There too the older ones took care of the younger ones.</sentence><sentence id="848">I remember I took care of a little girl, and I still remember her name.</sentence><sentence id="849">Her name was Violet.</sentence><sentence id="850">Now she was a little Catholic girl.</sentence><sentence id="851">She had a problem.</sentence><sentence id="852">She would not let anybody touch her.</sentence><sentence id="853">She had a mental problem.</sentence><sentence id="854">But I liked that little girl.</sentence><sentence id="855">I still remember how she looked.</sentence><sentence id="856">She had curly hair, dark curly hair.</sentence><sentence id="857">She had kind of a dark skin and I liked that.</sentence><sentence id="858">I always was so white that I always liked somebody that had a dark skin, so I took a liking to her but I knew that if I would touch her she would pull away.</sentence><sentence id="859">But I used to kind of flirt with her.</sentence><sentence id="860">I used to smile at her, talk to her, and eventually I was able to just play a game with her of touching and soon we became friends and I was able to touch her.</sentence><sentence id="861">And that gave me a lot of satisfaction, because I was the only one.</sentence><sentence id="862">In that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> we also uh had food.</sentence><sentence id="863">It's true we had chestnuts for breakfast, for lunch and dinner, but it was food.</sentence><sentence id="864">But to this day I don't like chestnuts.</sentence><sentence id="865">On Sundays we used to get chocolate milk, but it isn't chocolate milk like we have here.</sentence><sentence id="866">It was like a very...almost like a between a pudding and between a chocolate milk.</sentence><sentence id="867">It was very thick, but I loved it.</sentence><sentence id="868">It was delicious.</sentence><sentence id="869">And uh we had bread.</sentence><sentence id="870">We had soups.</sentence><sentence id="871">We even had some meat once in a blue moon, and...but we were not starving anymore and we slept between two sheets, which was luxury.</sentence><sentence id="872">We used to uh do work for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="873">I learned how to sew, how to do embroidery.</sentence><sentence id="874">I learned how to knit.</sentence><sentence id="875">We also were farmed out to farmers and I learned how to cut grapes and also uh to pull weeds and to pull bugs off potato leaves because they didn't have insecticides in those days, so this was done by hand.</sentence><sentence id="876">And we used to do things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="932">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="933">Could we at this point pause?</sentence><sentence id="934">We need to change tapes and then we'll come back to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="947">A: OK.</sentence><sentence id="948">It was (cough), it was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="949">I happened to like it.</sentence><sentence id="950">Uh the sisters had a lot of faith and when bombings were going on, for instance, instead of going down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>, they would have us go out in the in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and uh we would hold hands and uh we would just form a circle and dance around and the only protection that we would have would be a piece of wood that we we would put between our teeth and the bombs would fall and there we were, just dancing around.</sentence><sentence id="951">It's true though that they had a big sign on the <span class="DLF">roof</span>, and I forgot what it was...saying that they couldn't bomb the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> because it was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="952">There was some kind of a sign saying you cannot bomb here but you know, whether that would hold true that they would honor that or not who knows, but that's what it was and nothing ever did happen.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="959">Q: OK.</sentence><sentence id="960">We need to stop the tape...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="963">PAUSE</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="965">Q: Tell me about the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and bombing raids on the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="966">You had started a story.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="969">A: OK.</sentence><sentence id="970">In the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, when uh the air raids would start, we didn't go down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">What we used to do, we used to out into the <span class="BUILDING">court</span>...into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, and there we would hold hands and dance around the circle.</sentence><sentence id="972">And the only protection that we used to have was a piece of wood that we would take between our teeth so we would not bite our tongue, and it's true that there was a sign on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> letting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> know that they should not bomb the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, but whether they would actually uh do this or or not, we really weren't that sure, so we were scared.</sentence><sentence id="973">But the sisters, they had a lot of faith and that's the way we did it, and I'm here to tell the story.</sentence><sentence id="974">Uh the other thing that I remember is that one day we were walking...we always used to walk to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> two by two, and we were in uniforms.</sentence><sentence id="975">I used to stand out because I had blond hair.</sentence><sentence id="976">The children, most of the children who were French, have dark hair.</sentence><sentence id="977">Dark hair, usually a darker skin, but my hair no one had cut for quite some time so it was very long, very blond.</sentence><sentence id="978">I looked very very German.</sentence><sentence id="979">While <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milleau</span> was occupied and there were Nazis walking all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and as we walked towards the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, suddenly a Nazi comes up to me, started stroking my face, started stroking my hair, and I was petrified.</sentence><sentence id="980">I could not look at him.</sentence><sentence id="981">I was trembling.</sentence><sentence id="982">And it was just fortunate that the sister who had been walking in front of the <span class="DLF">line</span> just happens to turn around and saw what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="983">She came towards him and started talking to him and he let me alone.</sentence><sentence id="984">And thank God I had the presence of mind not to open up my mouth.</sentence><sentence id="985">It was a frightening experience.</sentence><sentence id="986">Uh the other thing that I remember is that, like I say, I liked the story of Jesus.</sentence><sentence id="987">I was really taken up by it and I want to convert.</sentence><sentence id="988">And I told the sisters, I said to that one sister, I said, .1 still remember her name... , | would like to become Catholic.</sentence><sentence id="989">And she would shake 4 her head and she says, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="990">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="991">I don't think your fath...your father and mother would like that, and I would say, it would be so much easier.</sentence><sentence id="992">And it's true.</sentence><sentence id="993">I was thinking it would be so much easier to be a Christian than to be Jewish but somehow I never did do it.</sentence><sentence id="994">But they are children, and many of them who did convert and who after leaving the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> did become Christians or were adopted by Christian families.</sentence><sentence id="995">We lost an awful lot of kids that way.</sentence><sentence id="996">But my sister and I, we stayed Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="997">Also we were in two different <span class="BUILDING">convents</span>.</sentence><sentence id="998">My sister, she had...by then she still was sickly and she also was starting to come down with TB.</sentence><sentence id="999">So in those years whenever you had something like that, they said you should go out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, so they sent my sister...at first they just wanted to send my sister out to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another <span class="BUILDING">convent</span>, and I argued with them and I said to them, if you send my sister, I go.</sentence><sentence id="1000">And I was very stubborn and so they had us both go and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balmal</span> (ph), to another <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and there it was, it was a <span class="BUILDING">farming convent</span> and we used to help take care of some of the livestock.</sentence><sentence id="1001">Well one day the sister told me take care of this cow, to take her to a certain <span class="DLF">pasture</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1002">Well, I've never been good at directions and I took her to the wrong <span class="DLF">pasture</span> because when I came back with her, the poor cow was all bloated and the sister was furious with me.</sentence><sentence id="1003">She says from now on I cannot trust you with the cows, so you're going to have to feed the pigs.</sentence><sentence id="1004">I know you can't do anything wrong feeding the pigs, so here I was, a nice little Jewish girl who doesn't eat any pork, feeding the pigs.</sentence><sentence id="1005">Uh we learned how to church butter and we ate butter for the first time in years, and oh did it taste good but the only trouble is we had a little bit of butter.</sentence><sentence id="1006">We didn't have enough bread.</sentence><sentence id="1007">At least it wasn't enough bread for me, and I was always hungry for bread, butter and jelly.</sentence><sentence id="1008">I used to dream about food.</sentence><sentence id="1009">We stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> until the war was almost over with and then this organization took us back and we went back to one of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1010">And there we stayed until it was over.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1053">Q: Tell us, tell us about the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell us first...did you find out...you had met up with your sister.</sentence><sentence id="1054">Did you find out where she had been?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1057">A: Uh not really.</sentence><sentence id="1058">We didn't talk about things like that that much.</sentence><sentence id="1059">It was...our talk was more about the everyday things, you know...what we were going to...eating was of the utmost importance.</sentence><sentence id="1060">We always talked about food.</sentence><sentence id="1061">Uh we used to do a lot... remember I used to do a lot of running.</sentence><sentence id="1062">Again the older children took care of younger children.</sentence><sentence id="1063">I seemed to have a certain aptitude to take care of like uh...I remember I took care of a boy who was a uh hemo...hemophilia I think...where they bleed.</sentence><sentence id="1064">I had to be very careful with him.</sentence><sentence id="1065">Uh II had to make sure that he would not run, that he wouldn't cut himself and I used to take him for walks.</sentence><sentence id="1066">We used to sit under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> for hours at a time, and uh he was my responsibility at times I remember.</sentence><sentence id="1067">Uh and then I used to take care of other children.</sentence><sentence id="1068">And uh we were, we were busy walking, exercising, uh like I say learning about what we could eat, what we couldn't eat, and also sitting down and learning French.</sentence><sentence id="1069">We used to play games.</sentence><sentence id="1070">Uh we had uh we used to dance like I learned to dance the __ there because we were all Jewish...butt different...there were children from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1071">There were children from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, from all different nationalities, uh not only German.</sentence><sentence id="1072">And I learned how to speak a little Yiddish, so it was...uh I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1073">We didn't even...I don't think we even did that much.</sentence><sentence id="1074">For the most...we were weak.</sentence><sentence id="1075">We didn't weigh very much, and we 5 concentrated more or less on our health and what we had to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1076">Uh oh we washed clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1077">I was always very particular as to how I look, and L...this story I got from my sister.</sentence><sentence id="1078">She used to say whenever there...because in many of those <span class="BUILDING">chateaus</span> they were old.</sentence><sentence id="1079">There was no running water for instance, so we had to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> but winter time comes.</sentence><sentence id="1080">It was too cold and most of the children wouldn't do it, but here I was, taking my <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span>, no matter how cold it was.</sentence><sentence id="1081">Or I would wash clothes out which a lot of the other children wouldn't do, and uh as a matter of fact I...there was a doctor.</sentence><sentence id="1082">I remember him because he used to come to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on horseback and uh he used to be quite fond of me and uh he used to call me Mignon (ph) which means sweet in French and uh he had another name for me which I...which escapes me now, and uh he was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="1083">He was very special.</sentence><sentence id="1084">The other thing that I had was a paren (ph), a god mother.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And usually I don't tell this story but I think here it's OK to...you know, I should tell it.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Uh she would send me money every month and there I had this money.</sentence><sentence id="1087">As a matter of fact it's in my documents, her name is, and uh she would send me money and I had all this money and I didn't really know what to do with all that money but I just saved it and once ina while some...we would get, we would be able to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and so I would buy a fountain pen with it.</sentence><sentence id="1088">I bought some uh uh shoe polish with it once, and uh I quarreled with my sister because she used too much shoe polish, as a matter of fact.</sentence><sentence id="1089">I said to her, do you think that I can spend all this money on shoe polish and you use it all.</sentence><sentence id="1090">She remembers that too.</sentence><sentence id="1091">She remembers all the terrible things I did to her, and one day we had gone into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I bought all the children ice cream and I felt likeabig because I had all that money, and why I had that power I don't know to this day.</sentence><sentence id="1092">But she wanted to adopt me.</sentence><sentence id="1093">Later on I found out, but she wouldn't take my sister and I wouldn't go without my sister and that was after the war.</sentence><sentence id="1094">As a matter of fact when the war was over with this organization having all of us on their hands, one of the things they did was advertise in the , which is a German-Jewish newspaper and it circulates in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in those days, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and my grandmother was the first one to read the advertisement that the org...that they had put in that paper saying that they Beata and Suzie Stern were looking for any living relatives and it was from my grandmother that we heard first.</sentence><sentence id="1095">She sent us a letter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1135">Q: From where?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1137">A: From <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And I was over-joyed.</sentence><sentence id="1139">I thought oh, my grandmother is alive.</sentence><sentence id="1140">Because by then I was constantly worried...would anybody be alive and what would become of us.</sentence><sentence id="1141">I mean can you imagine.</sentence><sentence id="1142">Here we were.</sentence><sentence id="1143">Two little girls and realizing that their...the letters from our parents had stopped after a while we were in those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1144">So I knew something happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="1145">Also by then there were a lot of rumors going around.</sentence><sentence id="1146">I mean I don't know whether...I don't know whether we knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all those terrible camps or not.</sentence><sentence id="1147">I really don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1148">I just remember something terrible was happening to people, but it was not a descriptive type of a information that I received or or knew.</sentence><sentence id="1149">I just knew something terrible happened.</sentence><sentence id="1150">As a matter of fact, after I didn't hear from my parents, I became uh very scared and I wouldn't talk for a while.</sentence><sentence id="1151">They had a hard time getting me to talk again because I was so afraid.</sentence><sentence id="1152">Uh and I used to constantly 6 worry...think what will become of us?</sentence><sentence id="1153">What's going to happen to Suzie and I?</sentence><sentence id="1154">So when I heard from my grandmother it was just really something to me, and then my uncle also wrote, and soon we heard from my aunts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and my uncle and aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1155">Well, everybody wanted us.</sentence><sentence id="1156">They all said, come to us.</sentence><sentence id="1157">We'll see that you get out and we'll take care of you.</sentence><sentence id="1158">So we had a choice but this paren, she also wanted me and she even said what a wonderful life you will have with me.</sentence><sentence id="1159">I, I had...I always wrote her thank you and she communicated with me too whether I don't...I haven't found any of her letters amongst the letters that I have but there was some kind of communication and it must have been by word mou...mou...mouth and word.</sentence><sentence id="1160">And I just know she also wanted to adopt me.</sentence><sentence id="1161">But I said no, because she wouldn't take my sister.</sentence><sentence id="1162">I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because I remembered my grandmother, but my sister said no.</sentence><sentence id="1163">Let's go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, because that's the shortest route.</sentence><sentence id="1164">Now we have been traveling all this time, constantly, and my sister probably was even more tired than I was.</sentence><sentence id="1165">And so she thought, well, it's the shortest <span class="DLF">route</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1166">Let's go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1167">So I said OK.</sentence><sentence id="1168">So one day they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to process all the papers I imagine and this...there was a lady in who was a friend to one of my aunts and she knew that my mother was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, so my aunt had told her about us and that we might see her and to watch out for us and low and behold, we met up with her and to this day I call her Tanta Santa (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1169">And she came with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, I remember I had all this money and I thought to myself, I don't need this money anymore.</sentence><sentence id="1170">I should give it away.</sentence><sentence id="1171">And I said to Santa, I said to her, you know, I'd like to give this money to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1172">Why to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1173">Why I want to give the money away?</sentence><sentence id="1174">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1175">But I said to her, I don't need this money.</sentence><sentence id="1176">Take this money and give it to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1177">So I gave her the money.</sentence><sentence id="1178">Now it's interesting...at that time I really didn't know it was to her that I gave the money.</sentence><sentence id="1179">I found that out years and years later when I discussed this part of my life with her, and she said to me, Beata (ph), you gave me that money.</sentence><sentence id="1180">It was me you gave it to.</sentence><sentence id="1181">And I saw to it that that money went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1182">And like I say, what prompted me to do this I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1183">Then uh also the other thing we did while we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> was Tanta Santa and I, she had lost her husband.</sentence><sentence id="1184">She didn't know where her husband was.</sentence><sentence id="1185">I didn't know whether...where my parents were.</sentence><sentence id="1186">I didn't know there was a cousin who I was very fond of...his name was Robert...and his mother who was, had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> with my mother, Aunt Clara...I want to find out where all these people had gone to, where they were, whether they were still alive, and they had lists in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span>...they must have been public places, so we went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to all these different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and we would look at these lists, looking for my parents and other relatives and she looking for her moth...for her husband.</sentence><sentence id="1187">We would go from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other and it was terrible for us because we would never see the names, so we knew, you know, they were gone.</sentence><sentence id="1188">And we did that...we were...I, I had forgotten...we were a few days there, and we never did find any of the names, but we always, every morning I remember we used to have hope and we would go out and she would take me around.</sentence><sentence id="1189">Every evening we would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> dead tired and we felt so bad, so desolate and so sad.</sentence><sentence id="1190">Then after a few days it was time to board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>, so we went and it was one of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span>...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1245">Q: Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="1246">I think you need to back up to explain something for me.</sentence><sentence id="1247">Your aunt, or as 7 you called her your aunt, had taken you from to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1253">Q: Alright.</sentence><sentence id="1254">How did you make arrangements to go where with her?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1257">A: Well, she did.</sentence><sentence id="1258">She made all the arrangements.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I...that was out of my hands because I didn't know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1260">I was just...1 was by then twelve years old, so I didn't know that much but I knew...she wanted... wanted to go with her because I must have been...I was very close to her and when, probably when she said she was looking for her husband, I must have said well I'd like to look for my parents and for my Aunt Clara and so I used to go with her and she remembers me doing this.</sentence><sentence id="1261">And uh that's how, but then she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1262">She didn't come on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and then we were about uh I think we were about fifteen, sixteen children who boarded that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1263">It was one of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Calais</span> and suddenly there were rumors on board that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> were mined, and we thought, oh my God.</sentence><sentence id="1264">We've come this far to be blown up.</sentence><sentence id="1265">And uh we got scared but after a while we noticed there was uh mine sweepers going ahead of us and everything was alright, or not quite alright because there was a storm and it was such a rough voyage...most of us kids were throwing up all over and we were so sick and so miserable.</sentence><sentence id="1266">Lucky for us there were some Waves aboard and that was my first experience meeting Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1267">And they were wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1268">Absolutely wonderful to us.</sentence><sentence id="1269">They took care of us.</sentence><sentence id="1270">Washed our faces.</sentence><sentence id="1271">Cleaned our clothes off and made it bearable.</sentence><sentence id="1272">Well we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and then we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and there was my uncle who had come to meet us, and uh I was over-joyed at seeing them.</sentence><sentence id="1273">Being with a family again.</sentence><sentence id="1274">Living in a regular <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1275">It it was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1276">My aunt spoke French, which was good.</sentence><sentence id="1277">I by then had a hatred for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1278">I hated the idea that I was born in such a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1279">I was ashamed.</sentence><sentence id="1280">I was ashamed of being German.</sentence><sentence id="1281">I was almost ashamed of myself.</sentence><sentence id="1282">Where all these feelings came from I don't know exactly but I was...I was ashamed.</sentence><sentence id="1283">I didn't want to speak German, so my aunt spoke French with us and uh they were good to us, but times were difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1284">They lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were all broken, because of the bombings there and there was cardboard on the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1285">Uh food was rationed.</sentence><sentence id="1286">I remember my aunt tried so hard to uh get sugar so she could bake some cakes, or even just bake.</sentence><sentence id="1287">Uh we had to start going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1288">My aunt thought it would be good if we started <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but at first she uh used to tutor so we would learn English, and he was wonderful.</sentence><sentence id="1289">We came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and and at that time, through those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, in fairly good condition except we had calluses on our feet.</sentence><sentence id="1290">We didn't have shoes and we used to go bare-footed so much of the time, so the calluses were about an inch thick and it was very painful after a while, these calluses, and we had to go to a foot doctor and slowly get all that layer of callus taken off.</sentence><sentence id="1291">Uh the doctor was so nice.</sentence><sentence id="1292">Uh my aunt still talks about him to this day because he would not accept a penny for any of it when he heard our story because he had never seen feet that callused.</sentence><sentence id="1293">Oh, I forgot to tell you too and the only other shoe that I remember wearing was in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> they gave us some which are wooden shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1294">But they are also very hard because we didn't have the nice little slippers to fit into the ____ so we used to just wear the wooden show and most of the 8 time I didn't like them.</sentence><sentence id="1295">They didn't feel very comfortable and so I used to kick them off and just walk bare-footed.</sentence><sentence id="1296">But we suffered, I suffered very badly from uh those calluses.</sentence><sentence id="1297">Uh we were malnourished to some extent but my aunt managed to get us as much food as possible and we were under the doctor's care, the foot doctor care and this and that.</sentence><sentence id="1298">Uh I started to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1299">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1300">My aunt and uncle were orthodox.</sentence><sentence id="1301">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanford Hill</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and there were a lot of Hasidim (ph) and it was a lovely <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1302">I absolutely loved it and it was good living uh there.</sentence><sentence id="1303">I felt I was again with my family, so uh I started this uh Victor (ph) High School, but it was hard for me.</sentence><sentence id="1304">I could not sit still.</sentence><sentence id="1305">I didn't have any patience.</sentence><sentence id="1306">I always wanted to be on the go.</sentence><sentence id="1307">And it was too hard for me because not only was I learning English, they were teaching us a awful lot of Hebrew, the .</sentence><sentence id="1308">We studied _.</sentence><sentence id="1309">It was all too much.</sentence><sentence id="1310">I was just overcome because I had never had any really formal Hebrew uh lessons before, and finally I told my aunt I don't want to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1311">I just don't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="1312">At first she more or less told me yes I had to go, so I got in to trouble at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the teachers must have contacted her and that was the end of my schooling.</sentence><sentence id="1313">And so she had me take uh sewing lessons because I was quite...1 was good at sewing and my uncle had a...he manufactured handbags in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, so I learned how to use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and I would help him with that, but again it was sitting and I just could not sit.</sentence><sentence id="1314">So he says OK, if you can't sit how about going to uh to some of the people I do business with and I'll give you samples of my handbag and you show it to them and see whether they want to buy any.</sentence><sentence id="1315">So I went to these different uh <span class="NPIP">places</span> and uh showed the samples and I would take the orders, bring them back to my uncle.</sentence><sentence id="1316">He would box them up in big boxes and I still remember shipping (ph) them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> and taking them to the various <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and so that was my job.</sentence><sentence id="1317">My other job was taking care of my little cousin and I made myself quite useful and I alwa...my aunt always gave me money.</sentence><sentence id="1318">She says since you work for me, here's money.</sentence><sentence id="1319">So I had money again, and I always used to go to the movies with my friends and I had a very good social good life.</sentence><sentence id="1320">Uh we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> until 1947.</sentence><sentence id="1321">Then my...I had two aunts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and an uncle and they decided it would be best for us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1322">And also one of the reasons was that my father had written them a letter saying that if anything should happen to him or his wife, that we are to go to them, because they were the sisters of my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1323">So they took this letter and they said this is your father's wish so this is what you should do.</sentence><sentence id="1324">Well, they had trouble with me again.</sentence><sentence id="1325">I didn't want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1326">I loved it there.</sentence><sentence id="1327">I liked the religious life.</sentence><sentence id="1328">Uh I liked living among the Hasidim (ph) because they were so joyful.</sentence><sentence id="1329">I loved going to the...[ hada girlfriend.</sentence><sentence id="1330">She was Hasidish and I would enjoy going to services with her and I enjoyed...I remember attending the weddings and it seems almost every week somebody was getting married.</sentence><sentence id="1331">Anyhow this was our social outlet and I just loved it, and my aunts had a hard time convincing me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1332">But uh then at the end of uh October in "47, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>, we came to uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and I don't know how much more of my story you want or not.</sentence></p></dialogue>
