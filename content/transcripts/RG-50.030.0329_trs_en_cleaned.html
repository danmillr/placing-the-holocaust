<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="299">Q: So, this was in 1943 when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="301">A We arrived I believe in late 1942 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">It was around November, in the fall, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> started to burn the next year, in 1943.</sentence><sentence id="303">So, I was at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">I was going for walks with the children and I have seen Jews going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> like hundred Jews together.</sentence><sentence id="305">They were -- their clothes were torn.</sentence><sentence id="306">They had the yellow swastikas (means stars of David) on them and they were going from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="307">I don't know where they were going, but I stopped and I looked at them and it inserted in me such a pain.</sentence><sentence id="308">In a way I was happy that I wasn't one of them.</sentence><sentence id="309">I could have been there among them, but the pain was unbearable.</sentence><sentence id="310">I turned away and I cried that nobody should see me that I was in such pain.</sentence><sentence id="311">When I was in this family, I think this was my mother's teaching that we should all go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">So, I asked the family where is the nearest <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and I took the children every Sunday, and I dressed them and I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday with them.</sentence><sentence id="313">Around -- and this is how we lived.</sentence><sentence id="314">My sister had an incident the older one she was walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and a woman from our <span class="NPIP">place</span> recognized her and she started to call her.</sentence><sentence id="315">So, she run away and we were told that.</sentence><sentence id="316">So, there was a period of time when we were afraid to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, you know, how big is whole <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">There may be some people coming shopping and being on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, somebody can recognize.</sentence><sentence id="318">So every moment, every step that you did, you had a certain fear in yourself.</sentence><sentence id="319">There was a fear of being recognized.</sentence><sentence id="320">At one point, my family, the husband of the wife brought up a girl and she had a document, she had dark hair, she looked like a typical Jewish girl, and he started to interrogate her and she had the paper and the seal was like of a penny, or a dime, and he started to question her and he took her away to the Gestapo, and he interrogated her in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="321">You can imagine how I felt at that time when he interrogated the girl and he did bring her to the Gestapo.</sentence><sentence id="322">But life was going on until about July when all of a sudden two Gestapos showed up in the 01:25 <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they said to my lady, to the wife of this man, you have here "ein Juedisches Kind", you have a Jewess here.</sentence><sentence id="323">She looked at him, I have a Jewish girl here?This is not possible.</sentence><sentence id="324">And she opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and she showed him Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="325">She said, Hitler is my god.</sentence><sentence id="326">How would I be able to hold a Jewish girl in my <span class="BUILDING">household</span>.</sentence><sentence id="327">She denied it, and I will never forget this.</sentence><sentence id="328">I was peeling potatoes at that time, and I became almost stiff, and he was talking to her that this young girl has a mother with another girl, and so she started to swear to them that it's not possible that she's Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="329">Either her mother or the other sister is Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="330">She will swear by that.</sentence><sentence id="331">So, he said tell her and he spoke to me German but I stood with the back, not to understand from Jewish to German is very easily to be understood and I pretended I don't understand.</sentence><sentence id="332">So, she told me in Polish that I should get dressed and I should go to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="333">I had no other choice.</sentence><sentence id="334">It was July.</sentence><sentence id="335">It was hot, whatever I took and the two Gendarmes

Easter you will go with me to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and you will do the confession in front of a priest.</sentence><sentence id="692">When she told me that I almost died <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="693">I said how will I be able to do that?</sentence><sentence id="694">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="695">I was hiding someplace <span class="NPIP">in</span> the <span class="NPIP">corner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="696">I said the prayer, whatever I said, nobody was listening to me if I said correctly or not, and here I will have to stand in front of a priest and to say all those prayers, and she was standing right behind my back.</sentence><sentence id="697">I kneeled down -- again, I brought myself the catechism, this is a 3 religious book, and there was no electricity and I bought candles, and where I took the money from the candles I don't recall, and at night I was learning the

if this was out of necessity or I was young or I was brilliant, and I knew all those prayers.</sentence><sentence id="701">So, the holidays came closer and I prepared myself like every night and when she went to sleep I put on the candle and I was studying and I went in front of the priest and I kneeled down and I said you have to unburden yourself with all the sins that you committed during the year, and I was I think past 14 at that time, and I really was an innocent child, what could I have sinned.</sentence><sentence id="702">You know what I told the priest?</sentence><sentence id="703">That I was saying bad things about my mother which wasn't true, but I had nothing else to say.</sentence><sentence id="704">He looked at me and he saw such a young face and he gave me a prayer 30 times to say I should cleanse myself with those prayers and I went to the corner of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I said all the prayers, and I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I was very, very relieved.</sentence><sentence id="705">Believe me, since then she never said that I had a Jewish head on my shoulders.</sentence><sentence id="706">This was around Easter time.</sentence><sentence id="707">I think around end of June I started to see Russian soldiers coming in, and they said that the Germans are running away already from the <span class="REGION">territories</span> that I was there, but I couldn't believe it.</sentence><sentence id="708">They were dirty, they were torn.</sentence><sentence id="709">The uniforms that

Russians.</sentence><sentence id="713">She said be quiet and sit still and don't talk to nobody.</sentence><sentence id="714">We have to see and wait what will go on.</sentence><sentence id="715">Then in August I don't know if I heard from people or papers, I saw that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> is already free.</sentence><sentence id="716"><span

feel like you know she was stepping on me and I was doing a lot of chores and no matter what I did when she was killing a pig she needed maybe 50 pails of water and I had to carry it by myself and I just felt the evenings that I couldn't do this any more.</sentence><sentence id="718">She started to get very rude and I had the sense of feeling that I was already liberated in a way.</sentence><sentence id="719">The Russians are here already why should I perform such work and she doesn't deserve it.</sentence><sentence id="720">So, I went to my mother and I told her that I'm going to leave this lady because she became unbearable to me.</sentence><sentence id="721">She said sit another couple of months and we'll see what will 01:53 develop.</sentence><sentence id="722">But I packed myself up.</sentence><sentence id="723">I can only tell you that I had only one pair of shoes and one little underwear, my whole thing was a little package, and I took this package one day and I said to mother I arrived at <span class="NPIP">mother's place</span> and said you can kill me here.</sentence><sentence id="724">I am not going back to that woman.</sentence><sentence id="725">She's a real witch, and I don't want to suffer any more.</sentence><sentence id="726">My clothes started to fall apart.</sentence><sentence id="727">You know as you grow you start to expand so I started to get holes in my clothes and she wouldn't buy me nothing.</sentence><sentence id="728">There was a certain resentment and anger, so I was working only for the food.</sentence><sentence id="729">But really the liberation and knowing that the Germans are going, I wanted to see what will be next.</sentence><sentence id="730">And when I said to my mother that even if she'll kill me, I'm not going back to the woman, she had no choice.</sentence><sentence id="731">So, she said okay you will sleep here.</sentence><sentence id="732">The next day I walked out into the <span

over the food that they have grown it was just like everybody lived by themselves.</sentence><sentence id="734">I met a man, listen to that, and he was an adult, I was at the time already close to 15, and he took me aside in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and he said I suspect that you are a Jewish girl and your mother too, with the other sister.</sentence><sentence id="735">I can tell you that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> there is already the Jewish committee from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that they came and they established, and
