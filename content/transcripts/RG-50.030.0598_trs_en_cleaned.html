business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">And we lived comfortable, but no comparison to my uncles who were all very wealthy.</sentence><sentence id="22">And my father was, by nature, highly musical, would have liked to be a musician, which was out of the</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="26">question.</sentence><sentence id="27">And as I mentioned before, he had been in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="28">At the age of 18, he had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> like some of his brothers.</sentence><sentence

woman.</sentence><sentence id="38">As I say, most women were much stronger and more able to cope than men.</sentence><sentence id="39">And my childhood, as such, was quite pleasant, until I was about 5 -- until I was about 10 years old.</sentence><sentence id="40">And even then, our parents protected us to the umpteenth degree.</sentence><sentence id="41">We really didn't know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="42">They kept -- I knew from nothing.</sentence><sentence id="43">To the extent that -- I don't know if it's right or wrong.</sentence><sentence id="44">Today you would probably consider it wrong.</sentence><sentence id="45">At that time, it was the thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="46">You didn't talk to your children about -- I know we covered the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">We thought somebody was listening in.</sentence><sentence id="48">This was in the late "30s.</sentence><sentence id="49">And I went to a <span class="BUILDING">German grade school</span>, and the teacher was very anti-Nazi.</sentence><sentence id="50">I think because they told them that songs which were forbidden, famous song, and had two children who they sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>; so they would not have to go into the Germany Hitler Youth Movement.</sentence><sentence id="51">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> was extremely antisemitic always.</sentence><sentence id="52">And I was -- since my father had been in the World War | and fought at the front, I was -- the Jewish children whose parents fought, their fathers fought in the front, they were allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">German high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">I refused to go,

into.</sentence><sentence id="55">You had to pass an exam.</sentence><sentence id="56">I don't know how I did it.</sentence><sentence id="57">I copied somebody else's notes.</sentence><sentence id="58">Got in when I was 10 years old and managed to graduate.</sentence><sentence id="59">We were forced to graduate with an equivalency of a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> exam at the age of 15.</sentence><sentence id="60">That is when <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> shut down.</sentence><sentence id="61">It was a very <span class="BUILDING">orthodox school</span>, where I learned -- we had Hebrew every day.</sentence><sentence id="62">I learned nothing.</sentence><sentence id="63">I had a good life.</sentence><sentence id="64">I had a good social life there.</sentence><sentence id="65">And then somehow or other, I got to -- my parents got me on the Kindertransport.</sentence><sentence id="66">I remember my father coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and saying, you are going to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">Sounded great to me.</sentence><sentence id="68">Anything to get out at that time.</sentence><sentence id="69"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> was not as bad as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span>, because, of course, there was more of an international community there.</sentence><sentence id="70">So I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="71">I remember, as I said, being on the -- my mother pushed me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence

other kids.</sentence><sentence id="75">And the Nazi officer came through just before we got to the <span class="DLF">Dutch border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">And he said -- I had a watch, a very cheap watch.</sentence><sentence id="77">And he said, a Jewish kid doesn't need a watch, and he took my watch.</sentence><sentence id="78">I had nothing.</sentence><sentence id="79">We got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">They gave us hot chocolate.</sentence><sentence id="81">Some people can remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">I have no recollections of how I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> where I was taken in by a</sentence><sentence id="84">Jewish family arranged through relatives my mother had in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, I think, who were pretty poor.</sentence><sentence id="85">They were -- the woman, she was a young woman, very volatile.</sentence><sentence id="86">One minute she would hug me and kiss me, the next minute she'd hit me.</sentence><sentence id="87">And she had a little boy.</sentence><sentence id="88">I took care of him.</sentence><sentence id="89">I used to -- now he calls me all the time.</sentence><sentence id="90">Now he is 70.</sentence><sentence id="91">We are still in touch.</sentence><sentence id="92">He called me.</sentence><sentence id="93">He got in touch with me, I have to add, ten years ago.</sentence><sentence id="94">He wanted to know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="95">I don't discuss this thing.</sentence><sentence id="96">I don't discuss it.</sentence><sentence id="97">And I lived with him for a year and a half until I was interned at the Isle of Man.</sentence><sentence id="98">Because I was 15 when <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were invaded, and we were considered enemy aliens.</sentence><sentence id="99">And I was not yet 16.</sentence><sentence id="100">So we had to pass a <span class="BUILDING">tribunal</span> at the age
