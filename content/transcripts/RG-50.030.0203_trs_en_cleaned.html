<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="9">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="10">My name is Charlene Perlmutter Schiff.</sentence><sentence id="11">I was born December 16, 1929, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">My first years, my early childhood years, were very happy years.</sentence><sentence id="13">My family consisted of two wonderful parents and an older sister, Tchiya.</sentence><sentence id="14">My sister was four years older than I. We lived in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">Both my parents were educators and civic leaders of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="16">My father was a professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">State University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">He taught philosophy.</sentence><sentence id="18">He was a very educated man.</sentence><sentence id="19">He had several doctorates from different <span class="NPIP">places</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Sorbonne</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> and I'm not sure, one <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, I don't know if it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, I'm not sure.</sentence><sentence id="20">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a happy <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">It was usually filled with many people, people from all walks of life congregated there.</sentence><sentence id="22">I remember meetings, I remember <span class="BUILDING">recitals</span>, poetry readings, all sorts -- book reviews, all sorts of cultural activities took place in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">And, the important thing I would like to stress is, my parents were leaders, not only in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> at large.</sentence><sentence id="24">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> hosted the Starosta, which is, I guess, like a mayor here; the clergy, the Kshondz, the Polish Kshondz, the Ukrainian Batiushka, as well as the Rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="25">I had a lot of fun when I was a very young child.</sentence><sentence id="26">We were tutored from the time we were four years of age.</sentence><sentence id="27">We had private tutors.</sentence><sentence id="28">My father believed that education was one of the most important things in life, and he stressed that, and we had to obey his orders.</sentence><sentence id="29">The <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a loving <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, but there was a lot of discipline.</sentence><sentence id="30">At dinner time, I remember we would not speak until spoken to.</sentence><sentence id="31">My father had to speak first.</sentence><sentence id="32">I don't know, it seems that where we lived it was the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it was Ulica Mitzkievitcha 57, and I remember the <span class="DLF">street</span> was lined with old chestnut <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> all along the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span>, and it was a wide <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, was on a terraced piece of property.</sentence><sentence id="34">There were beautiful <span class="DLF">English gardens</span> in front, and there was like an <span class="DLF">orchard</span> in the back, and the entire <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was surrounded by a <span class="DLF">fence</span>, and there were steps going up to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">That's the way I remembered it, and that's the way I like to remember it.</sentence><sentence id="36">Unfortunately, it wasn't like that when I went back after the war to see the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="37">Coming back to my childhood, I remember that all during my very early childhood there was talk about our going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, immigrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, we called it <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">And, I remember on my fourth birthday I was walking with my father on the banks of our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and I asked him, "Papa, is that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="39">And, he explained to me that was not so.</sentence><sentence id="40">He tried to show me maps, but that was a little bit beyond my scope of understanding.</sentence><sentence id="41">He also tried to teach me many things, and I remember he explained what <span class="DLF">air</span> is that we breathe, and, again, that was a little bit too much for me, but we had a wonderful relationship.</sentence><sentence id="42">My mother was a very loving mother.</sentence><sentence id="43">She was on the go most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="44">I know that she was a teacher, but I do not remember her teaching, working as a teacher.</sentence><sentence id="45">She worked in different areas of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>, and I distinctly remember that every summer she organized, she and other ladies, but she was usually the chairman of it, she organized camps for the poor children, and these were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> for all the poor children in the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">It was not just a camp for the Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="47">Meetings were going on and the congregation kept coming, I mean, they used to congregate in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> continually.</sentence><sentence id="48">Now and then, there were meetings where my father would close the <span class="DLF">door</span> to his <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, and these meetings I was not allowed to interrupt.</sentence><sentence id="49">I did not realize what this all was about until after the war, but these were meetings with young people who my father helped escape illegally out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: What was your name, your first name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: My nickname was Musia.</sentence><sentence id="94">It's a derivative, Polish, Jewish, what have you, but my given name was Shulamit, here we pronounce it Shulamit, it's a Hebrew name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Can you talk about your sister?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: My sister was a very artistic person.</sentence><sentence id="100">She was four years older than I, and I know I was the bane of her existence, because I always tried to go and do whatever she did, and I bothered her friends.</sentence><sentence id="101">She played the violin beautifully, and she also played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">I was given some lessons, but, I was not artistic at all, and they finally gave up on me with these lessons.</sentence><sentence id="103">She continued, and she sometimes, you know, played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> during the recitals in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or she played the violin.</sentence><sentence id="104">I remember one incident, it's rather funny now, it wasn't at that time.</sentence><sentence id="105">I was angry with her, I was mad at her for some reason.</sentence><sentence id="106">I don't recall why.</sentence><sentence id="107">But, I got hold of some paint and I painted all the keys on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> so that she wouldn't be able to play.</sentence><sentence id="108">I was punished for that severely.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="119">Q: How?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="121">A: I was sent to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and I wasn't allowed to come out for the entire afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="122">That was a lot of -- that was a big punishment for me, because I was a free spirit, and I was sort of a tomboy, and I liked to be around, you know, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and play with children, climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and do all these sorts of things.</sentence><sentence id="123">I never painted the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">keyboard</span> again.</sentence><sentence id="124">It took a long time to clean it up, and I think it cost a lot of money, too.</sentence><sentence id="125">So, that was a mean deed that I did.</sentence><sentence id="126">But I loved my sister, I adored her, and she was wonderful with me.</sentence><sentence id="127">She was very patient, but I did not understand that.</sentence><sentence id="128">I felt very secure in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">I had so much love and so much caring that in retrospect I feel that gave me the basis, the strength, to survive.</sentence><sentence id="130">I thought about it a lot, and I think that's probably why I did -- one of the reasons I survived, I was able to survive, is because I had so much love, and security and caring in my very early childhood.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about your father and these walks that you took?</sentence><sentence id="142">Was this a regular --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Yes, and, I mean, the way it was arranged, my father traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, and now and then he would allow my sister or me to go with him to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, but we never went together.</sentence><sentence id="146">These were times, private times, for my father and me, or for my father and my sister.</sentence><sentence id="147">And, he, I guess now when I realize, he spoke to us a little bit on a higher level than we were able to -- than I was able to understand, but it was always very uplifting for me to be with my father one on one, just to have him to myself, and he would tell me stories, all sorts of stories, and he always tried, I don't know, it's almost -- it's scary to say this, but it's almost as if he knew that our time would not be long enough, and he tried to give me as much as he could of the knowledge that I could absorb.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: Before we go on, could we show the picture for a second of your parents and your sister, please?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: Of course, yes.</sentence><sentence id="154">This is my father here.</sentence><sentence id="155">This is a picture that my husband and I had worked on and finally -- I mean, it came to fruition in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">I had nothing left when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but some of my family had different pictures, and this is a composite of three different pictures, but these were the closest to what I remember my parents and my sister, that's the way they look, and that's the way I have them etched in my memory.</sentence><sentence id="157">They were very loving, giving people, and I'm sure | idealize them now, perhaps, a little too much, but that's the way I remember them.</sentence><sentence id="158">I cannot tell you one flaw in these three very perfect people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="165">Q: Did you spend time with your mother alone?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="167">A: Yes, yes, yes, we did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: Where or how?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: We would go, there was a great big <span class="DLF">park</span> on the -- well, it wasn't quite in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, but there was a <span class="DLF">park</span>, and this <span class="DLF">park</span>, I mean, was with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, you know, and flowers, and shrubs, and this is where people used to go when they wanted to take a walk.</sentence><sentence id="172">And on the edge of that <span class="DLF">park</span> there lived the landlord of the -- the rich landlord of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, she owned a lot of property.</sentence><sentence id="173">She was a very old, old lady, and I remember she always wore black.</sentence><sentence id="174">She was an old lady, she was a widow, and all she had around was just servants to help her.</sentence><sentence id="175">But, the <span class="DLF">park</span> was on the edge of her <span class="REGION">estate</span>, and that's where I would take walks with my mother, just she and I. We would go sometimes, the whole family, too, but our time one on one was very important to my parents, and they did give us time one on one.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="181">Q: Do you remember any conversations you had with your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="183">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="184">With my mother, I mostly discussed my friends, what she was doing, the things that she loved so much, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that she arranged for the children.</sentence><sentence id="185">I know she traveled quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="186">She was gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.61854" long="26.265704">Rovno</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovel</span>, and there she had meetings with other ladies who were also arranging for different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> for children, and she would tell me about the meetings, and I would ask, you know, what she would bring me, you know, little surprises.</sentence><sentence id="187">Wherever my parents went, they always had to bring us a surprise, whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="188">It didn't matter what it was, but we loved to have surprises, presents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: Who took care of you when your mother went away?</sentence><sentence id="196">Was your father at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="200">There was a young woman who would come in and stay with us.</sentence><sentence id="201">No, not my father, no.</sentence><sentence id="202">He never did dishes, and he never did anything in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> whatsoever, you know, as far as helping out, no.</sentence><sentence id="203">My father had a very wonderful <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="204">His <span class="BUILDING">private library</span> was his first love after his family I think, and teaching, and he collected rare books.</sentence><sentence id="205">His books, I mean some of them were first editions, and all sorts of rare precious books.</sentence><sentence id="206">And, people in the entire <span class="REGION">area</span> knew that he collected these books, so when they found a rare book they would come to him and he would pay through the nose to get these books.</sentence><sentence id="207">And often he would go into his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and read, or bring out a book for us to enjoy, but we always knew we had to wash our hands, and we were not allowed to touch these books without his permission.</sentence><sentence id="208">It was a very wonderful <span class="BUILDING">household</span>, perhaps, nowadays it might seem too strict for the way we live here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but we didn't know any different.</sentence><sentence id="209">I mean, we accepted it, we loved it, and we gained an awful lot from that kind of upbringing, I believe.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="221">Q: And, both you and your sister were part of what was going on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> most of the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes, yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: So, you were not considered just little children.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Well, I was a pain in the neck always, and I was into everything.</sentence><sentence id="228">I remember one time during Passover, there was a -- for the first Seder, which is a festive occasion, our parents gave my sister and me gold lockets with the Star of David to wear on our necks, and I promptly lost mine, and no one could sit down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> until we found that locket, because that's what I wanted.</sentence><sentence id="229">And, I was a little spoiled I guess.</sentence><sentence id="230">We did find the locket, I mean the Star of David and the chain, and I did not remember that occurrence until we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1985 and one of my father's former students reminded me, because he was one of the guests at that dinner.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="235">Q: Did you have your own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="237">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="238">I shared it with my sister, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Did you have your own little <span class="BUILDING">library</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="243">A: Yes, yes, I did, yes.</sentence><sentence id="244">We started collecting, I think I knew how to read when I was four, because we -- it was stressed, and it was part of our make up, that as soon as you knew how to speak, and walk, and talk, you had to start acquiring knowledge.</sentence><sentence id="245">My father was almost fixed on that, I mean it was a fixation with him, and he kept saying that knowledge and education no one can take away from you.</sentence><sentence id="246">And, again, in retrospect, I didn't realize it, but now I realize that the education that my father acquired was all done out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, the reason being, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> there were quotas, so he had to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to acquire his education and to him it was priceless and he tried to, I mean, I guess, give it to us, the feeling that education is very important.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: You described yourself as a tomboy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="255">Q: Not a student?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="257">A: Not a student, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="259">Q: What do you mean by being a tomboy, what did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: 1 liked to just, you know, loaf around, play, climb <span class="DLF">fences</span>, and I always had a little penknife with me, which came in very handy later on.</sentence><sentence id="262">I don't think I played with dolls much.</sentence><sentence id="263">I think I had one doll, that's about it.</sentence><sentence id="264">I bought a big, beautiful doll when we went back to Europe in 1988 to make up for it, but I think I wasn't into frilly dresses, I was not very feminine I guess.</sentence><sentence id="265">Maybe that's why.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="271">Q: How did you come by this pen- knife?</sentence><sentence id="272">That seems unusual.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="276">I just liked to have a penknife with me, and I asked for it, and my father and mother debated, I guess, but they finally gave it to me when I was about 5-1/2 or six years old.</sentence><sentence id="277">I had to show it every day when I'd come back, you know, from playing, that I knew how to use it, yes, and ever since, it's almost, I have a penknife with me now.</sentence><sentence id="278">I never go anyplace without a little knife.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: And, what did you do with it at five?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: Oh, I would get some, you know, willow, pussy willow branches and carve things and cut up things, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="287">Q: You had a <span class="NPIP">dream</span>, a recurring dream.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="289">A: Yes, I had a recurring dream, and it was more than twice or three times, I don't know how many times, but I dreamt that I was left in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> all by myself, and I remember when I woke up from that first dream I ran into my parents" <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I cried, and they tried to, you know, appease me, and tried to explain that it's only a nightmare, it's a dream, and it doesn't mean anything.</sentence><sentence id="290">And, when it happened several times, they just dismissed it in a way.</sentence><sentence id="291">It's almost scary, because this is exactly as if a prophecy, because it did happen later on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="295">Q: Were you hearing things about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> even as a five and six year old?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: I guess I was hearing, but it was sort of -- I did not realize what it was all about, but politics was part of every meeting, of every discussion, of every dinner, of every gathering in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, yes.</sentence><sentence id="297">But, I just didn't want to have anything to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="298">It was scary, and maybe that's why, but I just did not pay much attention to it, but it was discussed continually, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="302">And from the time I remember walking, all I remember in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a conversation about going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>.</sentence><sentence id="303">I knew my father had family there, and my grandmother was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and I remembered her address, 231 Echo Place, Bronx 57, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="304">I don't know if they had ZIPs at that point, but that's what I remembered.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="308">Q: Who was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="310">A: My father had five sisters and his mother, and they all ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, and he was the last one, supposedly, to leave.</sentence><sentence id="311">He was somewhere chronologically in the middle, but I'm not quite sure.</sentence><sentence id="312">At this point, I only have one aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span>, <span class="REGION">Ohio</span>, my father's sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="316">Q: Do you remember prejudice, or anti-semitism when you were growing up?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="318">A: Strangely enough, I do not.</sentence><sentence id="319">My friends were Jewish young people, and Polish girlfriends, and Ukrainian, and we all played together.</sentence><sentence id="320">We all had wonderful times.</sentence><sentence id="321">We were in each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="322">No, I must say honestly, I do not remember any anti-semitism before the war.</sentence><sentence id="323">Again, maybe I wasn't perceptive enough, but I did not see it.</sentence><sentence id="324">| had a good time, I played, and we were -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was open for everyone, I was welcome in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and they were welcome in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and I did not see it.</sentence><sentence id="325">Obviously, there was anti-semitism, but I was not aware of it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="384">A: That's a very difficult question to answer.</sentence><sentence id="385">When you -- they were traditional, they observed the holidays, all the, I guess, things that make one, you know, be considered a Jew, but we didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every Saturday.</sentence><sentence id="386">We were not kosher in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="387">I don't know how to answer that.</sentence><sentence id="388">So, they were and they weren't.</sentence><sentence id="389">They were, I'd call them, emancipated, or they were not assimilated per se, you know, because we all were very proud of who we were, who we are, but there was not such a stress on the observance of prayer and things like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="396">Q: Tell me what happened in 1939, at least as far as you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="398">A: In 1939 when the war broke out, September 1, the Russians -- the Soviet -- I mean at that point, now I know that Hitler and Stalin had an agreement.</sentence><sentence id="399">They divided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in half.</sentence><sentence id="400">We lived in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and, consequently, the Soviet Union took over our part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">I remember it happened maybe two or three days after the actual war started, and I remember long <span class="DLF">lines</span> of people, these were the refugees who were trying to escape from the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, they would -- I mean, there were people with bundles, children, and I mean it was a very sad picture, and that's what is in my mind, of all these people walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, not even on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> because there were so many of them.</sentence><sentence id="402">And then, when they stopped, that's when the Russians came in, and there they were the soldiers and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="403">People greeted them with flowers, very happy, and it was sort of exciting for me, not realizing what was happening, but there was no blood shed in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you could hear the sound, I guess, of guns and all in the background, but for a very short time.</sentence><sentence id="404">They came in, and as far as I know, nothing really changed for us with one exception, the official language became Russian instead of Polish, because -- and that was no problem, because most Europeans are bi- or tri-lingual because of necessity, our neighbors all around us were speaking a different language, so that was no problem.</sentence><sentence id="405">And, my father still had his job.</sentence><sentence id="406">I mean, he kept his position at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="407">I'm sure there were some very drastic changes, but I did not realize them.</sentence><sentence id="408">Some of the people who had <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> in <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, I guess, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they are the ones who probably felt the change more drastically than I did, because most of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, or all, became nationalized.</sentence><sentence id="409">And, at first we had much of everything, and then all of a sudden things started to -- there were shortages of bread, milk, clothing, but that was not my problem, that was my parents" problems, and I did not sense any perceptible change in anything.</sentence><sentence id="410">The Russian language came after a little while, it wasn't difficult, and they did not single out one particular group of people, but I guess they did, only I didn't realize it, they singled out the people who were materialistically rich.</sentence><sentence id="411">And, now and then, I understand, there were people who all of a sudden would disappear at night and we wouldn't know, you know, what happened to them.</sentence><sentence id="412">These were the people that were, I guess, driven out to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="413">These were the -- they called them the Kulacks, the rich people, but we were not materialistically rich, and my father was an intellectual, and he was left alone.</sentence><sentence id="414">I know one thing, that going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a little more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="415">My father paid more attention not to be so visible in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as he was before, and I'm sure that was because of the Soviet occupation.</sentence><sentence id="416">Other than that, I really did not see many changes.</sentence><sentence id="417">Again, we still had meetings, the people congregated in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="418">There were some disappearances.</sentence><sentence id="419">The Polish Kshondz, the Polish priest, wasn't there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="420">There were still the big beautiful <span class="BUILDING">Kosciol</span>, that's the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">Polish church</span>, which was right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span>, and it was a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="421">It looked almost like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span>, and, again, there were old chestnut trees all around that <span class="BUILDING">Kosciol</span>, and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a beautiful statue of Swienta Matka Boska, and that means Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus, it was a beautiful statue, and it was always surrounded with flowers, even in the winter time.</sentence><sentence id="422">And, that sort of got neglected when the Russians came in.</sentence><sentence id="423">The <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian Tzerkev</span>, that's their <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, was very close to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and that was also a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the onion-shaped domes in gold, and I noticed that there were not as many people attending as they did before the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="450">Q: And you noticed that then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="452">A: Yes, but I didn't question it at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="456">A: No, no, I was not frightened.</sentence><sentence id="457">In the beginning, it was sort of exciting, you know, all these changes, I was not frightened.</sentence><sentence id="458">We were, I sensed that my parents were very disappointed, because, apparently, our papers were almost ready for our immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I remember, I'm not quite sure, but I think it was in 1938, that we all traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> for interviews, and I guess we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span>, you know, getting ready to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, but, of course, the war interrupted all that.</sentence><sentence id="459">And, I sensed that my parents were disappointed.</sentence><sentence id="460">I know one thing that happened.</sentence><sentence id="461">In 1939, I think it was 1939, there was the World's Fair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, and my father was offered two tickets, he received two invitations through the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to attend the World's Fair.</sentence><sentence id="462">My father asked for four tickets, and, of course, they didn't give him the four tickets.</sentence><sentence id="463">So, that's ironic and very sad for me now.</sentence><sentence id="464">I remember taking only one trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, during that occupation.</sentence><sentence id="465">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="466">I mean, during the Russian occupation, only one time, and there was a speaker, and I mean, of course, it was all in Russian, you know, and I didn't have as good a time as I used to at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: No, that was another thing that, again, I mean these things come out only when people question me, because I don't, you know, realize how important it was.</sentence><sentence id="485">He used to be a visiting professor at the <span class="BUILDING">Jagelonski University</span>, which is a famous old <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="486">And, when the Russians became our -- when they occupied our part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, my father's visits or trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> stopped, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="490">Q: Was your mother working during this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="492">A: No, she was not working, no, I mean working for pay, no, she was not, no.</sentence><sentence id="493">So, I mean, we didn't have money problems, but we didn't live a very -- we lived a comfortable life.</sentence><sentence id="494">I didn't know any better.</sentence><sentence id="495">We used to get shoes twice a year, in the summer and winter, that's it.</sentence><sentence id="496">And, I mean, you know, everything was just regimented and very -- not frugal, but my mother -- my parents were very careful with the money because there wasn't that much money.</sentence><sentence id="497">We lived comfortably, and I wasn't lacking in anything, and it was a wonderful life.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="518">Q: "41?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="522">A: -- no, "41, that's "39 to "41, nine, ten, at that point I already had my own friends and I didn't bother my sister too much, she was far too old for me at that point.</sentence><sentence id="523">But, no, there was no dating, but there were activities at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and we used to observe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Imieniny</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Imieniny</span> is like a birthday.</sentence><sentence id="525">It's actually, it means giving a name, and they had Imieniny every week it seems like one of her group, you know, had a party, and at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there were parties, and there was a very active social life, and there were lots of activities.</sentence><sentence id="526">She had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, my sister, and that was rather -- that was a luxury.</sentence><sentence id="527">I never learned how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span>, and I did not have one of my own.</sentence><sentence id="528">I was supposedly to have gotten her's later on, but it never came to be.</sentence><sentence id="529">And, we used to go on Wycieczki, and that's like trips, I mean, just go to the <span class="DLF">park</span>, you know, picnics, and from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, these were organized things, organized activities, and then we did it also on our own, and there were many sports events.</sentence><sentence id="530">I don't know, it wasn't football, I think it was soccer, and there was, I want to say softball, it's not softball, with a net, what do you call it, volleyball, yes, volleyball.</sentence><sentence id="531">There were all sorts of activities and, I mean, games that we used to play, and in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I remember, there was a huge <span class="DLF">school yard</span>, and we would go out for there for hours for our physical education, there was physical education from the time you were in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, and it's organized, you know, and I mean we used to play all sorts of games and these were very entertaining and very fulfilling.</sentence><sentence id="532">We used to run, have games of running, and walking, singing, and it was a lot of fun.</sentence><sentence id="533">And, I guess when the Russians came in they just took over the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and all, but they continued with the same activities.</sentence><sentence id="534">There was one thing that I would like to bring out, too.</sentence><sentence id="535">I wanted very much to become a Brownie, and Jews were not permitted to be in the scouting movement.</sentence><sentence id="536">That was - - when I say there was no anti-semitism, that is the one sign, I didn't realize why, but Jewish boys and girls were not allowed to become Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and I missed that because of the physical -- I mean, they had so many physical games, you know, and they did their activities, they were very fulfilling to me, very appealing to me, and I could not participate in that.</sentence><sentence id="537">I know I'm jumping from one <span class="NPIP">thing</span> to another.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="554">Q: When did life change drastically, 1941?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="556">A: In 1941, early summer, life took a turn for the worse.</sentence><sentence id="557">Apparently, my parents did hear, and the whole community, they heard what was going on in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but I don't know, but it seems, of course, I didn't know then, but it seems no one could believe the atrocities that took place, and so, we just went on with life as it was.</sentence><sentence id="558">In 1941, in the summer, all of a sudden we heard bombs and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> flying overhead, and after a few days the Germans marched in very much like the Russians did a few years before, and, again, I mean, there was no bloodshed as far as I can recall.</sentence><sentence id="559">They came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="560">They came in, the soldiers looked much -- they were much better dressed, and they came in and people again greeted them with flowers, and they were very welcome in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="561">A lot of people were very happy that the Germans came in, and that the Russians were leaving.</sentence><sentence id="562">If there were fights, they were outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, so, really, there was very little fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span>.</sentence><sentence id="563">But in 1941, early summer, was when the world became completely topsy-turvy for the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="564">When the Germans came in, from the very beginning, they concentrated and they let it be known that the Jews are the ones that they are going to try to murder, all of us.</sentence><sentence id="565">What they did, I don't recall if it was the first or second day after they came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span>, they went 1 around with a list and they looked for people by name.</sentence><sentence id="566">These were people who were leaders, the Jewish leaders, and my beloved father was among them.</sentence><sentence id="567">They came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, they burst in, and they asked for him, and my father saw them, he tried to get out the back way.</sentence><sentence id="568">They caught him, and they led him away.</sentence><sentence id="569">He never even said goodbye.</sentence><sentence id="570">I'll never forget that look in his eyes.</sentence><sentence id="571">And, this way, they took away about 300 of the Jewish leaders.</sentence><sentence id="572">The next day, it seems every day from then on there were decrees.</sentence><sentence id="573">At first, it was for the Jews, we always had to congregate in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, that's the central place.</sentence><sentence id="574">And, each day there were new decrees.</sentence><sentence id="575">First, we had to bring all the gold, all the silver, all the radios, all the furs, all the rugs, the Persian rugs, everything that was of any value, we had to bring to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> to give to the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="576">It was an organized thing, and everyone, there was so much chaos, and so much panic, that it's almost like people were going in a trance.</sentence><sentence id="577">All of a sudden, most of the heads of the families were gone.</sentence><sentence id="578">We didn't know where, when, or if we'll ever see our fathers and brothers again.</sentence><sentence id="579">I know now that when they took my father away, my mother was still a very young woman and she turned gray overnight, but she tried very much to camouflage her feelings, and she did not want us to feel the despair that she probably felt, and everyone else there, too.</sentence><sentence id="580">We were gathered every day for different things.</sentence><sentence id="581">First, I mean, we had to part with all our dearest possessions.</sentence><sentence id="582">Then, they gathered us in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and we had to watch when they burned the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and the little -- there were little, they call them schtiebels, they were separate <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="583">They burned all our Torahs.</sentence><sentence id="584">They burned all the books of prayer, and we had to stand and watch.</sentence><sentence id="585">Everyone who was over 14 years of age was sent to slave labor, and that was right from the beginning after they, you know, ordered us to bring all the things to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="586">My mother and my sister ended up working.</sentence><sentence id="587">My mother was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span>, and so was my sister, and they marched them, they met at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> in the early morning and they were marched back at night, and sometimes both my sister and my mother were black and blue from beatings, from, you know, awful treatment that they endured during the day.</sentence><sentence id="588">This lasted about two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="589">I'm not quite sure of the exact time, but then one day people were told not to go to work, and we were given approximately an hour to take whatever we could carry with us, and we had to congregate again at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="590">There, we were told we are going to move, we are going to live in a new <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="591">They marched us into one of the poorest sections of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and we were assigned a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="638">Q: -- you were all there?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="640">A: Yes, yes, we were all there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: Do you remember what happened after he -- do you remember his face?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="646">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="648">Q: What happened to you when he left?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="650">A: His face was very sad and there were tears in his eyes.</sentence><sentence id="651">He tried to put on a jacket, a coat jacket, and they wouldn't allow him, so he went in his shirt sleeves.</sentence><sentence id="652">It was almost a bewildered look, but he turned his head, and they held him on each <span class="NPIP">side</span>, there was a Ukrainian, there were Germans, but the Ukrainians were the ones who grabbed him, and these were people, I'm sure, that he knew.</sentence><sentence id="653">I don't know who they were, but my mother said she knew who they were.</sentence><sentence id="654">And, there was a look, I can't describe it, but it was great sadness, and bewilderment, and love.</sentence><sentence id="655">It was a mix of many feelings in that one last look.</sentence><sentence id="656">And, my mother gathered my sister and me, we just looked and we started crying.</sentence><sentence id="657">And, that's the way they took him away.</sentence><sentence id="658">They took him out the back, the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span>, not in the front.</sentence><sentence id="659">It was a very poignant, very sad moment in our lives, but I don't know, but my mother, whatever she felt, she didn't show.</sentence><sentence id="660">She right away tried to tell us how wonderful it will be when we are all together again, from the very first.</sentence><sentence id="661">And, the next morning she got up, she was gray, completely gray.</sentence><sentence id="662">This lasted, again, all these horrible things, lasted for about two weeks, and then when we were herded into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> life took a new turn for the worse.</sentence><sentence id="663">My mother and my sister were still marched to work every morning.</sentence><sentence id="664">The people, like myself, under 14 and very old, were left to ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="665">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was completely enclosed by a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> that was reinforced with <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="666">There were two <span class="DLF">gates</span>, one in the back, I mean, one in the front and one in the back, and one could not enter or leave without a written pass.</sentence><sentence id="667">We had to wear the Star of David on the front of our clothing and on the back, for some reason it had to be yellow in color.</sentence><sentence id="668">Everything was very regimented.</sentence><sentence id="669">The Germans appointed a Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="670">The Judenrat was a group of men who were sort of in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and anything and everything that the Germans wanted from the Jews they went through the Judenrat, because it was beneath them to go to an ordinary Jew to request things, so they did it all through the Judenrat.</sentence><sentence id="671">This is also a very sad occurrence, because here our brothers, our own kind, who are requested, "I need 200 people," you know, and they have to make the selection who these 200 people will be to deliver to the Germans, and at that point we didn't know what was going to happen to these people.</sentence><sentence id="672">Every now and then in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there were, they called them Lapanka, and these were round-ups again.</sentence><sentence id="673">The Germans would drive by with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, and they would grab people randomly, and I mean it didn't matter if you were a worker, or if you were an old person, or a child, and these people would never be heard from again.</sentence><sentence id="674">And, sometimes during when people were working, during work, and consequently that made it very, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="675">Every morning when I would get up and I would say goodbye to my sister and my mother, I never really knew whether or not they would return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that evening, because they could have had a Lapanka at work.</sentence><sentence id="676">I forgot to tell you, about my father's <span

sort of being still neither here nor there, one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and several Germans came out, very 3 well dressed, and they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and came in, and demanded to know where my father's <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="678">And, my

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="745">Q: Charlene, can you describe the day that you moved from your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, what that was like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="747">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="748">I would go a little bit back, because as soon as they took my father away, and then they took his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> away, my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work one day, one evening, and whatever we still had, a little bit of jewelry, some gold coins, she sewed in some of these coins and jewelry in each of our clothing, and her own, and my sister's, and mine, and I sort of thought it was really exciting and fun at that point.</sentence><sentence id="749">I said, "Why are you doing that?"</sentence><sentence id="750">She says, "For a rainy day."</sentence><sentence id="751">And, I mean, these clothes were -- it was my coat, I had a heavy coat, and she says, "Wherever we go, whatever we do, you take that coat."</sentence><sentence id="752">And, that's what she told my sister, too.</sentence><sentence id="753">But, anyway, so we did have these things sewn in the lining of our clothing, and when the time came that we had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we were herded into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we paid attention to take these pieces of clothing with us.</sentence><sentence id="754">What I grabbed, I remember, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span>, and some underwear.</sentence><sentence id="755">I was wearing my high-top shoes, even though it was in the summer, and I took that winter coat and a sweater, and I don't recall, no toys, none whatsoever, and I don't know what my -- my sister tried to grab her violin, but my mother told her to leave it, and she took some food, we had dried noodles and some food that could be -- that wasn't perishable.</sentence><sentence id="756">My mother took some pots and pans and some of her clothing and one suitcase, and I don't know what she threw into that suitcase, but that's all I remember that we took with us, nothing else.</sentence><sentence id="757">She took some blankets, I think.</sentence><sentence id="758">And, when we were thrown into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we were assigned one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="759">It was a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, actually as far as I recall it was a three-story <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, it was in the poorest section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and it was in great disrepair.</sentence><sentence id="760">We were assigned this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and there were three other families with us to share that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="761">The entire <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, and the running water was almost nothing, I mean there was very little water, there was no warm water, only cold water.</sentence><sentence id="762">If you wanted hot water you had to heat it on a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, and there was no wood.</sentence><sentence id="763">There was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep everyone on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and so the women, and there were two boys in that group, found some wood and they built <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, I guess, so that we slept like in threes, because there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for all of us.</sentence><sentence id="764">Most of the people in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> were people who went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="765">There were only, I think, three, four of us who were not quite 14 years of age, and we were the ones who were left at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to fend for ourselves in the very beginning.</sentence><sentence id="766">The people who did not go to work did not receive any rations.</sentence><sentence id="767">The rations were very meager.</sentence><sentence id="768">I am not quite sure of the weights, but it was like maybe two slices of bread, some oleo, a little bit of sugar, and I think some vegetables.</sentence><sentence id="769">I don't think there was any meat at all, and these rations, first they were given daily, then when the Judenrat organized everything it was done once a week, and usually by the second or third day everything was gone.</sentence><sentence id="770">My mother and sister shared their rations with me.</sentence><sentence id="771">It was very difficult, and in the beginning there was an awful lot of chaos.</sentence><sentence id="772">The kids, like myself, the younger, were really left with nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="773">We were very hungry.</sentence><sentence id="774">We were dirty.</sentence><sentence id="775">We were unsupervised, and it was very difficult to comprehend what really went on.</sentence><sentence id="776">We ate only at night, when our parents or whoever took care of us came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and all day there was nothing to do.</sentence><sentence id="777">Consequently, the kids, like myself, 5 decided that we had to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and try and get some food.</sentence><sentence id="778">It was an unbelievable feeling to be hungry, and it's a hunger that is very difficult to describe, for a child to be hungry and there was nothing to eat.</sentence><sentence id="779">And, I was asked many times what did we play, what did we do, we pretended, and what we played about mostly is about food.</sentence><sentence id="780">We talked about food, we pretended about -- I mean, everything centered around food.</sentence><sentence id="781">And so, ingeniously, we dug out two <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="DLF">fences</span>, below the <span class="DLF">fences</span>, so that a child could sneak out to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and, you know, take off the Star of David and try to act like a normal human being and see if we could obtain food.</sentence><sentence id="782">And, now and then, children brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> some food back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="783">I did it many times.</sentence><sentence id="784">It was very dangerous, because if one was caught one would pay with life.</sentence><sentence id="785">I mean, this was the order, to shoot to kill the person, the perpetrator.</sentence><sentence id="786">I was very lucky, and now and then I would bring a slice of bread, I would bring a carrot, or a potato, or an egg, and these were very, very great achievements.</sentence><sentence id="787">My mother made me promise that I wouldn't do it anymore, but I disobeyed.</sentence><sentence id="788">One time -- no, let me go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> again, in the very beginning, my mother and several other women organized a <span class="BUILDING">clandestine school</span> for children who were below the age of work, and it was a wonderful thing because we had something to look forward to.</sentence><sentence id="789">It made us forget about the hunger and about all the inadequacies of living such a primitive life, and this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> existed for several months.</sentence><sentence id="790">Several of the ladies, including my mother, would barter on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with crayons, with writing paper, with some books, and I mean they would tell stories, we would sing and we would color, and it was something to look forward to.</sentence><sentence id="791">It was really...if it only could have lasted, but it didn't.</sentence><sentence id="792">It lasted a few months, and pretty soon there was not enough jewelry or money to barter with, there were no more supplies, school supplies, and the morale sort of sagged in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="793">The women came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they were too tired, and too hungry, and too beaten up to be able to go and put on a happy face for us kids.</sentence><sentence id="794">So, that disintegrated into nothing also.</sentence><sentence id="795">In the very beginning, there was like a -- not really a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, but there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and there was still one doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and somehow they obtained some medical supplies.</sentence><sentence id="796">And so, in the beginning there was sort of a little <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> when people got sick or needed some medications.</sentence><sentence id="797">But shortly after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> came into being, the doctor was grabbed in one of the round-ups, in the Lapanka, and that was the end of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="798">From then on, people who became ill, first they stayed in their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, then there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and you'd walk down the <span class="DLF">ghetto street</span> and you would see people sick, or dying, or dead, and there was a committee within the Judenrat who was in charge of burying the dead.</sentence><sentence id="799">And, sometimes they wouldn't get to these people for days, because it was -- there were so many of them, and there was a lot of work to be done.</sentence><sentence id="800">It was a very sad sight.</sentence><sentence id="801">When one imagines the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was completely cut off from the entire world, there was no newspaper, there were no radios, there was no mail, it was like we were in <span class="NPIP">Mars</span>, not on the planet Earth.</sentence><sentence id="802">The only way people did get information was through the workers who were going out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they somehow would gather rumors and information from the people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="803">In retrospect, I think my mother did a super human job in keeping my sister, and me fairly healthy and sane.</sentence><sentence id="804">It was very demoralizing to live in these conditions when we had to share one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>, and this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>, this was one of the bigger <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, there were about 100 people, and just to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was a horrendous experience.</sentence><sentence id="805">There was no water to cleanse oneself.</sentence><sentence id="806">It was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="807">I remember one time when my sister and my mother, when we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, 6 my sister was very lucky to obtain a new job.</sentence><sentence id="808">My mother was still digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and repairing <span class="DLF">roads</span>, but my sister was able to get into an old <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where young women were knitting and crocheting articles of clothing for the soldiers on the front, and that was a very, a choice job because you were sitting <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and, you know, it wasn't labor, you know, manual labor.</sentence><sentence id="809">One time she was ill, and she couldn't go in to work, and so, she gave me her pass and I was to take her <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="810">And so, I gathered in front of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> with all the other young women and passed as my sister.</sentence><sentence id="811">No one paid any attention, you know, as long as you had the piece of paper.</sentence><sentence id="812">And so, when we got into the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> I took her <span class="NPIP">place</span>, her friends showed me where she was sitting, and picked up a scarf that she started knitting the day before.</sentence><sentence id="813">I was not very good at what I was doing, and one of the German guards started staring at me intently, and he kept watching me for quite a while, and then he started cursing and yelling at me, and I know he said I wasn't doing it fast enough, and I still didn't do it much faster because I didn't know how, and he got very annoyed with me.</sentence><sentence id="814">He grabbed one of the knitting needles out of my hand and pushed it in my forefinger, and this is what it looks like now.</sentence><sentence id="815">I passed out, and I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that evening and that was a bitter lesson for never to try and take my sister's <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the ration that she would have lost that day.</sentence><sentence id="816">There were many awful incidents and occurrences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="817">One time there were three men, young men, who tried to escape from work.</sentence><sentence id="818">They were working and they were trying to make their way to freedom they hoped, instead they were caught and the Germans hung them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="819">It wasn't the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span>, but there was a central place where we all were forced to gather and to watch the hangings.</sentence><sentence id="820">And then, they let them hang there for several days, and each morning the people who went to work had to march by and turn their head to the right, and they were forced to look at these poor victims.</sentence><sentence id="821">There was one time when I snuck out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I was lucky to obtain two eggs, and I remember I was wearing a dress with little puffed sleeves, and I put an egg in each sleeve and tried to make my way back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="822">I paid for these two eggs with a small gold ring that had a ruby in it that my mother sewed into my coat.</sentence><sentence id="823">I was quite proud of myself, and I just could picture my mother's and my sister's faces when they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we had two eggs to eat.</sentence><sentence id="824">Just before I was entering the <span class="DLF">hole</span>, the camouflaged <span class="DLF">hole</span> back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, a Ukrainian guard spotted me, and he ran over and he started screaming at me, and he found the two eggs and threw them on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and made me kneel down and rubbed my face in them, and screamed at me to get right back where I belonged and never to show my face again on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="825">I was petrified, and I didn't give away the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>, the <span class="DLF">hiding entrance</span>, I marched back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, or he threw me back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="826">I guess he was one of the kind ones because he could have killed me, or he should have killed me.</sentence><sentence id="827">When I told my mother and my sister that evening about my experience, she just hugged me.</sentence><sentence id="828">A few days later, one of my best friends, and I can't name her because she has family and I did not tell them about that, I didn't have the heart, she snuck out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and she obtained some bread, and as she was trying to get back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> she was caught and she was murdered.</sentence><sentence id="829">They displayed her body in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for about a week, and we were forced to march by and look at her, and they didn't allow the burial society to bury her.</sentence><sentence id="830">These were lessons that we learned every day, and, yet, the will to live was so strong that everyone tried to survive as best as one could, and took chances, because there was no other way.</sentence><sentence id="831">I snuck out many times after that and was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="832">And, again, even though I 7 promised my mother I wouldn't, but hunger is a very strong motivator.</sentence><sentence id="833">I don't know if there are any adjectives with which to describe what real hunger is.</sentence><sentence id="834">It's a pain, a physical pain to be hungry, where your insides become like a knot and your brain stops working.</sentence><sentence id="835">There was no brain, it just says hunger, I want to eat, I want to eat no matter what, I want to eat.</sentence><sentence id="836">That went on for a long time, like an eternity, but it seems like when winter came it was doubly difficult, because we had to contend, not only with hunger and horrible conditions of living, but there was the cold, there was no wood to heat the <span class="NPIP">places</span>, there was not enough clothing to protect us, and in spite of my mother's support and love there was creeping in a feeling of despair, and there was a lot of demoralization in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="837">People started being hopeless.</sentence><sentence id="838">There was no way out, it seemed like.</sentence><sentence id="839">But, again, the strongest survived, and, apparently, my sister, and I, and my mother were the few of the strongest because we did survive.</sentence><sentence id="840">I don't know how.</sentence><sentence id="841">I think it was, again, my mother's constant preaching almost and telling us not to give up hope.</sentence><sentence id="842">She was an amazing person.</sentence><sentence id="843">She tried to instill hope where there was little hope, and she tried to make up stories and keep us entertained with everything that had a happy ending.</sentence><sentence id="844">How she felt <span class="NPIP">inside</span> we don't know, I know that she didn't feel that way, but she tried to transmit it and give it to us, and it did work, somehow it did work.</sentence><sentence id="845">Somehow we lived through until the next spring, and by that time I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was probably diminished in population by half.</sentence><sentence id="846">A lot of people died of starvation and cold.</sentence><sentence id="847">Some people were taken away in the round-ups, and others died because they gave up, not because they were ill, but they just gave up.</sentence><sentence id="848">They just felt they didn't have anymore strength to fight all these obstacles of life.</sentence><sentence id="849">And so, the Germans, every day there were different decrees.</sentence><sentence id="850">I mean, they made life more miserable.</sentence><sentence id="851">It was almost a design every day to torture by different decrees.</sentence><sentence id="852">I mean, they would demand money.</sentence><sentence id="853">They would demand more gold.</sentence><sentence id="854">They knew we gave it all up, no, we had to do more, we had to give more.</sentence><sentence id="855">It was just -- the Judenrat had a terrible time trying, you know, to be the mediator between the Germans and the Jews, and there were times, I understand, where they were having terrible arguments and discussions with our Jewish people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because it's as if they sat in judgment what to do and who to send out, and they really had no choice in what they were doing.</sentence><sentence id="856">By early spring, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> dwindled to about, as I said, half, and the Germans decided we had too much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we were too comfortable in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and so, one day they again gathered us all in the little <span class="NPIP">place</span>, it wasn't the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> because that was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and we were told again that we can take whatever we wanted and whatever we could carry with us.</sentence><sentence id="857">By that time, our possessions were even more meager than they were last fall, and we marched again to a new <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1049">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="1050">It started almost like a play in the very beginning when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, it was still summer, and we said, we got together, had nothing to do, all we talked about is hunger, we said, well, let's try and dig a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1051">And, we had some, like, shovels, actually, I don't know if they were toy shovels, but they were not full size, and there were some boys with us and they started it, and it was a game.</sentence><sentence id="1052">We did it within three or four afternoons, because several of us had to watch, you know, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, and it was an exciting thing to do.</sentence><sentence id="1053">We dug two such <span class="DLF">holes</span>, and we camouflaged them so beautifully, and I'm proud to say that not one child ever gave away our two <span class="DLF">exits</span>, not one.</sentence><sentence id="1054">I don't know if the Judenrat inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> knew of the -- well, they knew that there were some illegal exits, but they sort of looked the other way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1061">Q: How did you camouflage them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1063">A: We camouflaged them with like rags, there was no grass or anything, stones, and broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span>, and it was just done so that nobody paid any attention.</sentence><sentence id="1064">And, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, there was grass, and there were leaves, and I mean it just looked very normal, and some plaster and stuff like that on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, but not on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1065">It was done beautifully.</sentence><sentence id="1066">I was very proud.</sentence><sentence id="1067">I was not the main engineer of it, but there were some kids who were just wonderful at doing that, and it gave us a way of getting out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1073">Q: When you went in and out, did anybody stand guard?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1075">A: Yes, oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1076">It was a very well-organized --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1079">Q: Can you describe it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1081">A: Well, what we did, first of all, for instance I said I want to go tomorrow, you know, so there were three or four of us together, and there was also an agreement, whoever went out, and whatever you got, in the beginning we tried to share, but then it was very -- it was not feasible.</sentence><sentence id="1082">If somebody got a slice of bread, you wanted it for your family, so we decided whatever one got it was for him, or for her, and her family, and we took turns.</sentence><sentence id="1083">And there were about 20 or 30 kids, and we took turns in standing guard, and who would get out, and mostly we volunteered to get out, because we wouldn't say, well, you go, but mostly we volunteered.</sentence><sentence id="1084">And I went out a number of times, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And I don't know if I should be proud, it's nothing to be proud of, but when my friend was killed there was one other boy who was also murdered, but that was almost at the very end of the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and they buried him right away.</sentence><sentence id="1086">I don't know why, maybe because they knew we were going to move pretty soon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1093">Q: You saw your friend killed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1097">A: Yes, I did.</sentence><sentence id="1098">She was a beautiful girl.</sentence><sentence id="1099">She was probably one, she looked like a baby doll, she had blond hair and blue eyes, and she was so beautiful.</sentence><sentence id="1100">When she'd walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, people turned their heads to look at her, she was so -- her features were so perfect.</sentence><sentence id="1101">She was my friend.</sentence><sentence id="1102">She was about a year older than I, and we became very good friends before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, because we didn't live very far away from one another.</sentence><sentence id="1103">And then, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we were even better friends.</sentence><sentence id="1104">She had a mother and one brother, and she had a brother who left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1113">Q: This must have been difficult for you to see her, you saw her murdered?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1115">A: It was very traumatic.</sentence><sentence id="1116">I mean anybody, to see the hangings, and to see other incidents like that, were very traumatic, but this, this was my friend, my dear friend, and she looked so peaceful, and there was blood on her dress, and she looked like she was asleep.</sentence><sentence id="1117">And, my mother kept comforting me, and she kept saying, "She's not suffering anymore, she's not in pain."</sentence><sentence id="1118">Her mother died, my friend's mother died about a month after my friend was murdered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1119">In the spring, when the Germans decided we had too much <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and we were too comfortable, they built a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1120">I thought that was the poor section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Well, the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was really in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slums</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1122">This was a group of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> where most people did not live for years already, but there were just a few dilapidated <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1123">The only difference between the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the old was that the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was surrounded by a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> and barbed wire on three sides, and the fourth side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was bordered by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1124">And, that part, that <span class="NPIP">side</span>, was not -- did not have any <span class="DLF">fences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1125">We were assigned a little nook in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and, again, I mean, it was -- my mother made the best with what she had.</sentence><sentence id="1126">We tried to make it <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the main thing was to have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to sleep everyone on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1127">And, again, they had to build these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, because there was not enough space on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to sleep all of us.</sentence><sentence id="1128">This time, we had only two other families with us in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and these were all women and children.</sentence><sentence id="1129">There were no boys, or elderly or men.</sentence><sentence id="1130">My mother and my sister kept going to work again, as if, you know, nothing happened, or, I mean, as if they were still in the old <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and rumors began to fly that our end was near.</sentence><sentence id="1131">It was spring, 1942, and my mother tried desperately while she was working, when she was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, to make contact with some of our friends from before.</sentence><sentence id="1132">She wanted to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where someone would hide the three of us, because that's what everyone tried to do.</sentence><sentence id="1133">Finally, one day she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she was very excited, and she told us that she found two <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1134">She couldn't find one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the farmer or the people would be willing to hide three people, so she found two.</sentence><sentence id="1135">One <span class="NPIP">place</span> would hide one person, and another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the people were willing to take two people.</sentence><sentence id="1136">And, there was my mother's difficult decision, how and who should go where.</sentence><sentence id="1137">And in her infinite wisdom, she decided that my sister, being the older one, would be able to manage on her own, and mother and I would go to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span>, the two of us.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And, by that time, I mean, she was making plans, or she was excited, or she tried to be excited for our sake, and she kept telling us exactly where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="1139">I don't recall the name of the farmer that my sister was going to, but that was on the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and he -- the plans were that he would pick her up after work one evening, and that one morning when we all got up, we ate 1 our meager breakfast, and my sister took her little bundle with her, the most important things, clothing that she still had.</sentence><sentence id="1140">She wasn't crying, and I wasn't crying either.</sentence><sentence id="1141">We hugged, we embraced, and we said goodbye, and my mother kept saying how wonderful it would be when all this is over, we'll meet again, and papa will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we'll have great celebrations.</sentence><sentence id="1142">And so, she and my sister went to work, and that evening my mother came back by herself, and she told me that sister went off and everything was working according to her plan.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And I don't recall exactly, it wasn't the same evening, but maybe a few short days later, when there really were signs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that something was happening, we saw the number of the guards increase immeasurably.</sentence><sentence id="1144">I think they doubled the guards around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, and there were a lot more Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and right <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1145">And, one sensed that there was some commotion, something was taking place.</sentence><sentence id="1146">At that point, I knew that people really became hysterical, and a lot of people started building partitions in their, you know, <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, thinking that they could build like false <span class="DLF">walls</span> with scraps that they got from somewhere, and if they hide in these partitions, in these false <span class="DLF">walls</span>, that the Germans wouldn't find them.</sentence><sentence id="1147">Some people, you know, would make a hiding place in the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and some of them went and dug <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and <span class="DLF">tunnels</span>, all this within I think like two weeks after we moved to the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1148">Anyway, there was a lot of panic and chaos in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at that point, and a few days after my sister left, my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work and she says, "It's time to go.""</sentence><sentence id="1149">And so, she made me dress in my best clothes, and, again, | still had that coat with a few sewn in coins, and I put on my high-top shoes, and she got dressed and whatever she felt was still not threadbare, and she made two little bundles, one for myself and one for her.</sentence><sentence id="1150">We ate our meager supper, and when it got dark, really dark, it was a dark night, it was very quiet, we stepped out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, we didn't tell anyone.</sentence><sentence id="1151">At that point, no one shared information with anyone else.</sentence><sentence id="1152">It seems like everyone was an entity unto oneself.</sentence><sentence id="1153">We walked out, we didn't say goodbye to anyone.</sentence><sentence id="1154">And pretty soon we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1155">It was very quiet, and there were a lot of bulrushes and there's a lot of underbrush, and I held on tightly to my mother's hand, and all of a sudden shots rang out, and we ducked, and when it stopped we proceeded a little further.</sentence><sentence id="1156">But then, the gunshots were sporadic, but we could not move because it was still, and when we moved we made noise.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And so, we just stayed there, and we stayed the entire night, because these sporadic gunshots were making it impossible for us to move.</sentence><sentence id="1158">The next morning, there were no sporadic gunshots, it was regular now, and it seemed to come from every which <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1159">We heard a lot of noise, a lot of commotion, we saw fire, we heard screams, we heard babies crying, and it seems that it was none to soon that we got out.</sentence><sentence id="1160">At that point, a lot of other people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> tried to do the very same thing we did, and they ran towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1161">At that time, the guards started screaming, the Ukrainian guards, and this is a phrase in Ukrainian "Wylaz Zyde ya tebe bachu," and that means, "crawl out, Jew, I can see you."</sentence><sentence id="1162">That phrase rings in my ears constantly, and a lot of people came out.</sentence><sentence id="1163">My mother held me down and we stayed put.</sentence><sentence id="1164">And, that went on for several days, and my mother made me eat the soggy bread that was in the bundle.</sentence><sentence id="1165">It tasted awful, and she kept saying I have to be strong, and I can't give up now, and she kept giving me directions of how to get to the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> that was supposed to have been our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1166">And I felt I knew, and I told her, "Stop repeating it, I know how to get there," because we used to go there before the war and my mother used to buy some of the dairy products, like milk, and cheese, and butter 2 from that farmer, so I knew his name, I knew his family, and I knew where he lived, only we didn't go through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, we went all around.</sentence><sentence id="1167">That was in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skobelka</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1168">And we stayed pinned down, and at that point the gunshots were working full time.</sentence><sentence id="1169">There were screams from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and fire, and it never let down even at night, night and day.</sentence><sentence id="1170">I don't know how many days we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, but it was several days, and I kept dozing off.</sentence><sentence id="1171">And one time I woke up, or I thought I woke up, and I looked around, and my mother wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="1172">I really became panic stricken, and I didn't know what to do, and I just stayed there until the very end of that day.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And, by that time, everything quieted down.</sentence><sentence id="1174">There was no more sound except my own sobbing.</sentence><sentence id="1175">I was crying.</sentence><sentence id="1176">It was so still.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And, somehow at that moment I felt I let my mother down.</sentence><sentence id="1178">I fell asleep, and she probably couldn't wake me up, and she had to leave, and so, when it got real dark I made my way to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and by that time it was dawn.</sentence><sentence id="1179">I was wet, and petrified, and utterly confused.</sentence><sentence id="1180">I made my way to the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span>, and the farmer saw me and he led me into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, and I asked him, "Is my mother here?"</sentence><sentence id="1181">He said, "No."</sentence><sentence id="1182">I said, "Well, she is supposed to be here."</sentence><sentence id="1183">He says, "Yes."</sentence><sentence id="1184">I said, "Well, I'll wait until she comes."</sentence><sentence id="1185">And, he said, "No, you will not wait here.</sentence><sentence id="1186">I'll feed you, you'll stay until it gets dark, and you better leave."</sentence><sentence id="1187">And, I looked at him, I said, "You made an agreement with my mother," and I asked -- I mean, I addressed him by his name, which I don't want to give now because I think I have a lot of questions and I would like to resolve them some day before I die when I go back there, and I asked him, "You made an agreement."</sentence><sentence id="1188">He said, "I changed my mind," and he shrugged his shoulders and he said I have to go when it gets dark.</sentence><sentence id="1189">If I don't go, he'll report me to the authorities.</sentence><sentence id="1190">It was very ironic, because he was wearing a farmer's, like a coverall, and in the corner I saw my father's gold pocket watch with the chain, which I'm sure was part of the money that my mother tried to buy the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="1191">That evening, he didn't even come out, his wife came out, the farmer's wife came out, and gave me some food.</sentence><sentence id="1192">She gave me an apple, and she said I had to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1193">I was so stupefied and so bewildered, I walked out and I walked on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, not realizing that anyone could see me and give me away.</sentence><sentence id="1194">But, I just, I don't know, if there is a God he must have been with me, because I walked through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and didn't encounter anyone.</sentence><sentence id="1195">And finally I ended up in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> which were right on that <span class="DLF">farm</span>, I guess, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1196">There were <span class="DLF">fields</span>, <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span>, all around, and they were almost ripe for harvesting at that time of year, and I sat down in the middle of the <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> and I sat there for two days.</sentence><sentence id="1197">My food went, and I tried to gather my thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="1198">I had a terrible sinking feeling that I let down my mother, and I felt very guilty about it, and right then and there I decided that I must find my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1199">And that's when my odyssey really starts.</sentence><sentence id="1200">The <span class="REGION">area</span> where I come from is surrounded by many, many <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, and I felt, or I tried to feel, that my mother was there waiting for me and I had to find her, no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="1201">And so, I started, I knew that I would have to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, and I started walking.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And, the thing was that when you look at a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> it looks so close, and yet when you really start trying to reach it, it's much further than your mind tells you it is.</sentence><sentence id="1203">And so, I walked most of the nights and hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> during the day.</sentence><sentence id="1204">But then, there was another problem.</sentence><sentence id="1205">One had to eat, and I was hungry, and so, I had to find <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> that were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where I could sneak into a <span class="DLF">garden</span>, or a <span class="DLF">yard</span>, or a <span class="INT_SPACE">potato cellar</span>, or something where I could get something to keep me from dying from hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1206">The very beginning, the first months, were very, very painful, very -- I mean, it's almost like I was in a daze.</sentence><sentence id="1207">Several 3 things happened.</sentence><sentence id="1208">One of them, which, again, is riveted in my memory, was an incident that involved six other people.</sentence><sentence id="1209">The very first months after | was wandering in my search for my mother, I encountered stragglers from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, apparently, most of the surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, were liquidated around the same time.</sentence><sentence id="1210">It was the fall of 1942.And so, we would sit and exchange some information and try to find out if, perhaps, they knew anything about our loved ones and vice versa.</sentence><sentence id="1211">And so that at one time there were six other people, some of them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lokacze</span>, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.363442" long="25.11086">Beresteczko</span>, and a few other neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1212">And there we were at the edge of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, exchanging information and just glad to see other human beings like ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1213">All of a sudden, there were some children playing and they noticed us and they started screaming "Zhid"--just yelling "Zhide, Zhide," meaning "Jews"--and they ran back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1214">There was a very small remuneration for reporting a Jew, and I'm sure they wanted to report Jews and get the money for us.</sentence><sentence id="1215">And so we didn't know what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1216">First we tried to run into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1217">That <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> happened to have been a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where there was very little underbrush and consequently one could see very far, so it was not very good for hiding.</sentence><sentence id="1218">There were many huge haystacks in that <span class="DLF">field</span> because it was harvest time, and so we decided to go into a haystack to hide.</sentence><sentence id="1219">Why we all selected one haystack, I cannot answer.</sentence><sentence id="1220">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1221">But we all ran into one haystack, and we tried to cover ourselves as best as we could.</sentence><sentence id="1222">Pretty soon we heard the children back and adults.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And they made a game out of it.</sentence><sentence id="1224">They kept pushing their pitchforks into the haystack.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And there were screams and cries, and after it got completely quiet, that was it.</sentence><sentence id="1226">I waited and waited and waited.</sentence><sentence id="1227">It was quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1228">And it seemed it was an eternity, and then I made my way out of that haystack.</sentence><sentence id="1229">And there I saw six bodies lined up in front of the haystack, mutilated.</sentence><sentence id="1230">The only one I recognized there was a baby--that child must have been maybe two years old--that baby was on the chest of his mother.</sentence><sentence id="1231">They were all undressed, their shoes taken away, lined up very neatly.</sentence><sentence id="1232">I didn't even cover them, I just walked away.</sentence><sentence id="1233">And I walked into that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and I walked and walked and there was no end to that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1234">And so I decided to climb up a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1235">And a good thing too because that next morning--for some reason I don't know, it was near a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or something--but that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was full of Germans and Ukrainians.</sentence><sentence id="1236">They had a picnic or something.</sentence><sentence id="1237">And I sat there on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> trying not to move all day long.</sentence><sentence id="1238">I'm sure if I had been <span class="NPIP">below</span>, I would have been found.</sentence><sentence id="1239">It was really torture because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were, evergreens, you know, and they hurt when I was sitting there.</sentence><sentence id="1240">But I sat there all day without moving.</sentence><sentence id="1241">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> just like that, under me.</sentence><sentence id="1242">And when night fell and they left, I climbed down and started walking until I got to another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, which was I think dawn of the next day.</sentence><sentence id="1243">There were many awful incidents.</sentence><sentence id="1244">I remember once I didn't feel well, I was very hungry and I was very thirsty also.</sentence><sentence id="1245">Thirst is just as bad and just as painful as hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1246">And with my hands I clawed, I dug a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> and I climbed in and I covered myself with leaves and I just lay there.</sentence><sentence id="1247">I must have fallen asleep, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1248">When I woke up, I felt better.</sentence><sentence id="1249">I don't know how long I slept.</sentence><sentence id="1250">Animals kept walking by, nuzzling, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1251">There were snakes.</sentence><sentence id="1252">There were smaller animals.</sentence><sentence id="1253">I saw a bear one time, I think at that point, I did; and the only reason I can figure out that they didn't touch me is because I smelled like them.</sentence><sentence id="1254">I'm sure they thought I was one of them.</sentence><sentence id="1255">Not one animal tried to harm me except the stupid dogs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1256">They were awful.</sentence><sentence id="1257">The dogs--you know,

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1430">Q: Charlene, we were talking about the partisans and they wouldn't let you in because you didn't have a weapon.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1432">A: Yes, they made fun -- the partisans made fun of my weapon, a little penknife.</sentence><sentence id="1433">Well, again, I was very saddened that I would be alone, but I got even with them in my own way, before I left I appropriated a warm long coat, a pair of boots, they were different sizes, I remember that, but they were warm boots, and some mittens and a shawl, a lot of warm clothing, and they had lots of it, and also I took some food, and I just left.</sentence><sentence id="1434">My life in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> is very hard to analyze.</sentence><sentence id="1435">I think what kept me going is my quest, I mean my search for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="1436">Maybe deep in my heart I realized that I would never find her, but I was afraid to admit it, because if I had admitted that, I would have given up, and I had to go on.</sentence><sentence id="1437">So, I pretended, I think in retrospect I guess, I pretended that I'm looking for her and that I would find her no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="1438">So, I kept on going.</sentence><sentence id="1439">And, the hunger was awful, the thirst was awful, the cold was indescribable, terror and being afraid of everything and anything, because anything alive was my enemy.</sentence><sentence id="1440">But, more than anything else was the pain of being all alone.</sentence><sentence id="1441">Sometimes weeks and months went by without my hearing another human voice, and that is something that I cannot convey in words how painful and difficult it is.</sentence><sentence id="1442">I started talking to myself.</sentence><sentence id="1443">I listened for sounds.</sentence><sentence id="1444">Sometimes I imagined that I heard voices of people, and usually when I heard people's voices they didn't bode me anything good, and, yet, I longed for it.</sentence><sentence id="1445">So, in addition to being terrorized and tortured by all these uncertainties and fears, I missed a human voice, the sound of a human voice.</sentence><sentence id="1446">Sometimes I would sneak into a <span class="DLF">yard</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span>, because I was hungry, but more so because I wanted to hear the sound of a human voice, and that was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1447">I never felt that I could go on without living, without hearing another human's voice.</sentence><sentence id="1448">I could go on with hunger and thirst, but I couldn't go on for any length of time without hearing a human voice.</sentence><sentence id="1449">It was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="1450">There were many close calls that I had that I can't even begin to describe.</sentence><sentence id="1451">One time I -- I don't know if I told that before, but I saw the Galowy, that's the man in charge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, a forester, is that what you call them here, and he came up out of nowhere it seemed like.</sentence><sentence id="1452">I was in my little <span class="DLF">grave</span>, every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that I planned to spend more than a day in I tried to dig a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> and camouflage it, and all of a sudden I looked up and there he was on a horse, and I didn't even hear him coming.</sentence><sentence id="1453">And, he was kind, but he says, "What are you doing here?</sentence><sentence id="1454">You are not going to survive.</sentence><sentence id="1455">I'm going to take you to the authorities, it's better that you give up."</sentence><sentence id="1456">I said, "No, I'm not going to give up if you don't denounce me."</sentence><sentence id="1457">And, finally, I took out a gold coin and that gold coin saved my life then.</sentence><sentence id="1458">I still had two gold coins left after that, and each time they bought me my life in a roundabout way, and this guy came back, he followed me, and about a month later he followed me into another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, and he knew that I had some more money, and so I gave him the next coin, and the third one I gave to the Russians, that was later on.</sentence><sentence id="1459">How I lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, or in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>, plural, I don't know, but it's an amazing thing, when one is hungry and completely demoralized, you become inventive.</sentence><sentence id="1460">I never, when I even say it I don't believe it, I ate worms, I ate bugs, I ate anything that I could put in my mouth, and I don't know, sometimes I would get very ill, there were some wild mushrooms, I'm sure they were poison, I don't know, poisonous ones, I was ill, my stomach 6 was a mess, but I still put it in my mouth because I needed to have something to chew.</sentence><sentence id="1461">I drank water from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">puddles</span>, snow, anything that I could get hold of.</sentence><sentence id="1462">Sometimes I would sneak into <span class="INT_SPACE">potato cellars</span> that the farmers have around their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, and that was a good hiding place because it was a little warmer in the winter, but there were rodents there and all.</sentence><sentence id="1463">And, to say that I ate raw rats, yes, I did.</sentence><sentence id="1464">Apparently, I wanted to live very, very badly, because I did indescribable things.</sentence><sentence id="1465">I ate things that no one would dream of being able to.</sentence><sentence id="1466">Somehow I survived.</sentence><sentence id="1467">I don't know why, I keep asking myself, but I did.</sentence><sentence id="1468">To this day, I'm still looking for my parents and my sister, none of them survived.</sentence><sentence id="1469">I tried to go back, and it seems every year Iremember more details, but I try not to, I try to forget, but I can't.</sentence><sentence id="1470">I feel that I'm a prisoner of my memories, and I'm imprisoned in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> that I can't break away from.</sentence><sentence id="1471">But, I do feel that I have a mandate, and I must speak out for the millions who never had a chance.</sentence><sentence id="1472">I'm their spokesperson.</sentence><sentence id="1473">I have to tell the world what went on, so we can learn from these past mistakes, from the cruelty, and from the inhumanity of man towards man.</sentence><sentence id="1474">I'm saddened that in this day and age we have learned very little, and I've had several incidents where after I made a short presentation to school children a parent was questioning the truthfulness of my story, and verbatim he said, "Oh, come on, that's a figment of your imagination," and that makes me very sad, and it makes me more determined to tell the world my story, because it did happen, and it should not happen ever again.</sentence><sentence id="1475">I'm sure you want to know more details about my life in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1476">I don't know how I can tell you much more, except to tell you that I lived just like an animal.</sentence><sentence id="1477">I ate and drank human waste, but I never killed another human being, and I don't think that should I meet face to face with people who are responsible for my parents" and my sister's murder, and for the millions of others, I don't think I'm capable of killing another human being.</sentence><sentence id="1478">I could even forgive, but I cannot forget, and I do not want the world to forget.</sentence><sentence id="1479">And, my message to people who will listen to my story is that, in spite of all this I do feel that there is hope for humankind, and we must learn from the atrocities and from the past that were so unkind to me and to millions of others.</sentence></p></dialogue>
