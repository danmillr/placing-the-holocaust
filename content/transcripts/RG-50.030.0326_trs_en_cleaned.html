<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3">Q: I need you to start off by telling me your name, when and where you were born.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="5">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="6">My name is Susan Beer and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in May 14th, 1924, Just celebrated couple days ago my birthday.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Your name at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: My name was at the time Suzanna Eisdorfer, I got much shorter now.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Tell me a little bit about your life before the war, you, did you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="16">The reason I was born actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, my mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and her entire family lived there.</sentence><sentence id="17">She moved to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topolcany</span>, after she got married and my father decided as a young, poor doctor it's much easier to start life there.</sentence><sentence id="18">But then she didn't want to give birth in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the medical establishment wasn't just up to date and she wanted to be with her family, so I was just a month old then, I was taken back to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>, but it still shows that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and, well, actually it was very bad for me when it was time to immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because the quota for Hungarian born people was very, very small and limited, so it was difficult at the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: But, growing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topolcany</span>, what was that like?</sentence><sentence id="24">Tell me about your family, and...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="27">05:15</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="28">A: Well, unfortunately I was an only child.</sentence><sentence id="29">At that time I didn't feel the impact as much, I got special attention, which every boy child would like to have, but as I got a little older I really missed the, some, you know, sisters or brothers, and I depended very much on friendship, and I had lots of friends and we spend many days, I mean, we spend a lot of time together with the friends.</sentence><sentence id="30">You could walk by yourself as soon as you got a little older because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was small and very safe.</sentence><sentence id="31">We never heard of any disasters or any crimes.</sentence><sentence id="32">The only thing that was outrageous in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, we had one drunken man and when he use to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">tavern</span>, he use to pass our . . .</sentence><sentence id="33">where we lived and he use to knock on the <span class="DLF">window</span>, which was quite frightening and sometimes, but that was about all we knew.</sentence><sentence id="34">We lived in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which was called the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">There were mostly <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>, really the center of all activities was there, but there were a few <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span>, a little separated with a long <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> opened up from this <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, there lived a few professional people and we lived there out of convenience, because my father could have his <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span>, we could have upstairs, and then he could have downstairs his <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, everything was in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> and his patients were well trained.</sentence><sentence id="36">If they came and no one was there because he had no 05:17 receptionist or nurse, or anyone, he did everything by himself, they just rang the bell and someone would appear upstairs and it was usually yelling down and up, "who is coming down?"</sentence><sentence id="37">or "who is coming up?"</sentence><sentence id="38">And some of the patients that were more familiar and it was after <span class="BUILDING">office</span> hours would just come up and, many times our appetites would be taken away, it would be middle of the, some meal, and they would come with some of their specimens.</sentence><sentence id="39">So, when I was complaining as a child because I would stop eating as soon as all this is happening in my living, but I was not impressed by that very much.</sentence><sentence id="40">It was a pleasant life, I don't think culturally it was very exciting, we had no <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span>, we had couple <span class="BUILDING">movie houses</span> and the movies didn't change that often but as kids we had always Sunday afternoon cartoons or stuff like that and we had ice skating rinks.</sentence><sentence id="41">It wasn't fancy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">skates</span> like that, you know, with the shoes and all, it was the same skate that you had a key and as you grew you just enlarged the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">skates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="42">And there was a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> where you put them on or off and they served their hot chocolate or something and it was just fun.</sentence><sentence id="43">The same thing changed in summer to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tennis court</span>, and so we played tennis, I don't say I was ever great in that.</sentence><sentence id="44">And then there was a lumberman, who was very nice, and so he gave some lumber and at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> he made like a little beach area, there were a few very primitive, wooden sort of thing that you could change your clothes and there was a place where the local <span class="BUILDING">pastry shop</span> owner in summer brought out there some yogurt and food and you could buy something and he would bring some corn, or you brought your own food.</sentence><sentence id="45">It was quite a distance, you walk through <span class="DLF">fields</span>, but we were use to walking and we didn't mind that, and so there's summers and winters were spent that way except of course for going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">And unfortunately, close to 1938 all this pleasantry disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="47">It happened quite, it didn't happen suddenly, but it came suddenly into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I would say.</sentence><sentence id="48">My mother loved music and she played very well the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> herself, and she spent her afternoons listening to music that was coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, certain times in the afternoon.</sentence><sentence id="49">Once she listened to the music, expected to hear music, there came an angry voice through the radio.</sentence><sentence id="50">A man yelling and especially against the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="51">Of course, we then became to know that this was Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="52">And this was our first time that we heard his voice and what is behind that voice.</sentence><sentence id="53">And then, as he entered <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, there were some refugees coming to us and they told us about how they had to disrupt their lives and run and come to us, they were guests many times at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">But, even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was only few hours from where we lived.</sentence><sentence id="55">It was distant, because it didn't happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="56">And then, they came into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">And then we started to feel that it's getting closer and closer, and in fact my father went to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>, that was in 1938, to get some visa because he had distant relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> who supplied affidavits for us to come out.</sentence><sentence id="58">And he was told that there's just no way he could come.</sentence><sentence id="59">I recall very well he came back with a globe.</sentence><sentence id="60">He said "Now we can point our finger to where <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is."</sentence><sentence id="61">And, we still weren't terrified.</sentence><sentence id="62">We made this attempt, but then that's all we did.</sentence><sentence id="63">But then one day, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, I was at that time in the fifth grade of the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> .. .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="100">Q: This was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="101">A: Yeah, that was a public . . .</sentence><sentence id="102">it was actually <span class="BUILDING">city school</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> owned <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and as I came to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and was sitting there, all of a sudden our, we call them professors at that level, who use to teach us the Slovak language and he was a very good professor, came dressed in black Fascist uniform.</sentence><sentence id="103">He spread his legs Fascist-way apart and conducted a lecture, but not about the Slovak language, but a hateful language against the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="107">05:23 Jewish students in this class.</sentence><sentence id="108">We, you know, no one said anything.</sentence><sentence id="109">I think today we would have more courage to say anything, but it was so shocking to come and hear that everyone just was stuck.</sentence><sentence id="110">And up to that time, all in the class were friends, it didn't matter if they were Jews or non-Jews and somehow that disrupted everything.</sentence><sentence id="111">We were sort of divided, and soon after that we were not allowed to continue our schooling.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: What did he say in his lecture?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: About the fathers, I can't recall in detail, but how he hated the Jews, the fathers, I know they do this and that, I suppose what is always said of the Jews, that they take away from the others and you know, become rich that way.</sentence><sentence id="120">Which I knew in our case for sure was not so, my father was a practicing physician and he treated poor and rich and anyone the same way and the same length of time, he disregarded completely the amount of pay.</sentence><sentence id="121">I knew myself because he took me along many times on his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> calls and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that sometimes he would get a few carrots and sometimes some corn or fresh milk, that was his payment.</sentence><sentence id="122">And he even thanked because he knew that's all they could afford and so I knew that he was very, you know, wasn't right what he was saying.</sentence><sentence id="123">I wasn't that familiar with the other fathers, but I knew them well enough, I knew they were working people, and minding their own business.</sentence><sentence id="124">But it sort of spoiled the friendship from then on, we stopped little by little visiting each other, we didn't do projects anymore then when we stopped going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> became sort of separated.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What sort of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Community</span> was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, was it a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="133">A: Yes, it was Orthodox community, not all of it, we had people who were not that religious, but the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> owners, the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were mostly on the square and on Sabbath they were all closed, most of them.</sentence><sentence id="134">It was interesting, some days, because the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">The Catholics, because it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic town</span>, went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and on Sabbath, the Jews went to their <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="136">And my father didn't get religious Jew, and not frequenting the <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> but the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span>, the patients who were Catholic, took great comfort in that because in the case of emergency they knew exactly where to find him.</sentence><sentence id="137">If he wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he was in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> and they felt he was right there.</sentence><sentence id="138">You know, that he cared about the religion.</sentence><sentence id="139">And the community was a caring community, they supported a very good <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>, I went to that <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Public School</span>, and an old-age <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and there were very few poor Jews really, and if they were the community supported them.</sentence><sentence id="140">And...</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="141">Q: But, in general, did the Jewish Community and the non-Jewish community mix, was there any sense of Anti-Semitism before the war?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: I can only tell you what I remember from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="143">I use to go with my father to Gentile patients and next <span class="DLF">door</span> to us was where the local Priest lived, he lived with his mother.</sentence><sentence id="144">It was, you know, he was in charge of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, of the Catholic community.</sentence><sentence id="145">Mr. Richter was his name, Rev. Richter.</sentence><sentence id="146">I have even a picture of him because he taught us in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and he taught us Latin.</sentence><sentence id="147">And he, when there was a nun, when he taught the Catholic religion, we were permitted to leave, you know, the classes.</sentence><sentence id="148">But, you know, we could choose to stay, but my father was his doctor and his mother's doctor, he chose him to be.</sentence><sentence id="149">And I know later on that my father was not permitted to practice anymore as a Jew.</sentence><sentence id="150">He personally, and I have his letter, wrote to the Papal Nuncio to allow this Jewish doctor to practice because as he wrote, he brought so many Catholic children into the world and cared so much about the poor.</sentence><sentence id="151">And my father used to give lectures because they were very primitive, some of the population, and they believed in all kind of nonsense, like a cat runs across the <span class="DLF">street</span>, you know, this and that, and they practice this kind of medicine sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="152">And he used to go to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and show how they should 05:29 wash their hands, how important that is, and taught them some simple health, you know, gave them health education.</sentence><sentence id="153">And he was written up in the Catholic newspaper, I still have some of the newspapers, even though they are almost in shreds.</sentence><sentence id="154">But, he made a name for himself as a very caring doctor who didn't choose, if it's someone Jewish or non-Jewish and many people were that way.</sentence><sentence id="155">I didn't see such a terrible distinction between Jews and non- Jews, until the laws came against the Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="171">Q: So, the beginning of the war for you was when . . .</sentence><sentence id="172">was it about the time this teacher came into your <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Yes, I would say it was in about 1938.</sentence><sentence id="176">At first the rules were very mild, we gave up our radio, we had to give up our skates, even though they were simple sakes, tennis rackets.</sentence><sentence id="177">They were mostly things of luxury or, you know, like recreational things.</sentence><sentence id="178">You had to even give up your fur collar, from your coat.</sentence><sentence id="179">And they gave you, for each of these items, a receipt.</sentence><sentence id="180">But the biggest blow was to our family when some people, not even from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, some detectives from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>, which was a central, the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and where all the law started, from the Slovak government and they sent those people out and they stole all my father's medical equipment.</sentence><sentence id="181">And, from then on, it was for him against the law to practice medicine.</sentence><sentence id="182">And, we had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> as I said and I had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my father used that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when people came, they still wanted to come, even it was illegal, but they sneaked in and my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> became his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="183">He didn't have more than his bag, black bag with some of his equipment, but he was a very good diagnostician and he had most of what he needed in his head, in his ear.</sentence><sentence id="184">And he couldn't write prescriptions because it was illegal, but the pharmacist even though he wasn't Jewish was a good friend, and my father send me to, many times without the prescription, I had to memorize the instructions and I brought 05:32 back the medicine that the patients needed, so I became helpful to him and I always wanted to study medicine so this was very good.</sentence><sentence id="185">One day, I became really very resourceful, but my father didn't appreciate it.</sentence><sentence id="186">A lady came who needed insulin shots and she had to go away and she didn't want to wait for him, so I says "No, you can do it."</sentence><sentence id="187">So, just remembered what he did, I knew there shouldn't be any air in the needle because that could be fatal and I blew out the <span class="DLF">air</span>, filled up and gave her the shot.</sentence><sentence id="188">My father was so terrified that he ran to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to see if the woman is still alive.</sentence><sentence id="189">But, he discouraged me very much for doing that again.</sentence><sentence id="190">But, I enjoyed being, so to speak, his assistant in this except one day, we still had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">You know, most <span class="BUILDING">households</span> did because there are no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacuum cleaners</span>, there are no central heating or automatic warm water, so I had to bring up wood and coal and it was heavy chores, which wasn't really for a woman to do. [</sentence><sentence id="192">brief interruption] But, we had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was since I was born.</sentence><sentence id="193">It was really cook we could call her, her name was Marca, that was her first name.</sentence><sentence id="194">She came from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and even though she couldn't read or write, she was highly intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="195">She could memorize phone numbers and instructions and speak several languages really.</sentence><sentence id="196">And I adored her.</sentence><sentence id="197">She was like a second 05:35: mother.</sentence><sentence id="198">Even she had aching feet and when I was a kid she would put me in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and run in the snow, you know, she would do anything for me and one day, after these restrictions that my father couldn't practice anymore came, a woman knocked middle of the night on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and it was a daughter who's mother was in dire need of medical attention, she had some kind of a heart ailment and my father knew her so well that he always helped her.</sentence><sentence id="199">And this Marca, our cook, knew that especially at night if my father ventures out to a patient, he could be deported or jailed or what could happen to him and she didn't wake him up.</sentence><sentence id="200">She told the woman she can't wake him up to go because it against the rules and in the morning the woman came to our <span class="DLF">door</span> and pointed to this poor cook, our Marca, "you killed my mother."</sentence><sentence id="201">And she came to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> where we live to get the death certificate but before she did that, she did a very big disservice to come first to us and our poor Marca was a very devoted Catholic and she took it so much to her conscious that she became mentally ill from that point on.</sentence><sentence id="202">She wouldn't eat, she couldn't function, she totally deteriorated and she died eventually.</sentence><sentence id="203">And that was an immense loss because she was in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for almost seventeen years.</sentence><sentence id="204">And we went to her funeral and my father bought a stone for her in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, the inscription said, "For devoted service . .."</sentence><sentence id="205">and so on.</sentence><sentence id="206">So that was my first loss because of these rules.</sentence><sentence id="207">Then came the rules much faster.</sentence><sentence id="208">First, we had to make a star for ourselves out of sort of yellow felt with the blue Jewish star, and it said "Jew" on it, and we had to sew that on our clothes and we couldn't go out without that.</sentence><sentence id="209">I remember that first holiday was Rosh Hashana, then, everybody appeared with this star in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="210">And, kids they laughed, we saw it first, you know, it was funny, but it wasn't really very funny.</sentence><sentence id="211">Then there was a curfew, we couldn't go out after 9:00, we couldn't attend movies, we couldn't do anything at the end.</sentence><sentence id="212">The way we occupied ourselves because we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, each of us who was good in any subject would prepare herself, or himself, and meet in private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and sort of lecture the rest of the kids in geography or history or whatever, we did that ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="213">And then we had meetings, we had the Maccabi Hatsaie which was a youth movement, and there was a leader who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>, a young man, to sort of instruct us in Zionism.</sentence><sentence id="214">And certain books we had to read and meet and Friday night we would sing songs and psalms so, we would still have a little fun someplace.</sentence><sentence id="215">But then came 1942...</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="321">A: Yeah, the community had to come up with the money to get those fifty people out.</sentence><sentence id="322">But you know, that never ends.</sentence><sentence id="323">When they take, once money they want more money.</sentence><sentence id="324">And then of course all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, the Jewish owners were kicked out, the Gentiles took over, they called it Arisovak ["arienization"].</sentence><sentence id="325">You know, I don't know how to translate it actually, you know, the gentiles took over the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">Then they started to come, we couldn't have any help anymore, you know, and like we had to give up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and the rules were getting tougher and then you couldn't travel.</sentence><sentence id="327">If you wanted to travel out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, you had to have identification, couldn't travel without that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="337">A: Well actually, where would you travel?</sentence><sentence id="338">One <span class="NPIP">place</span> was like the other so it wasn't important to travel for anyone, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="341">Q: How did, your father, how did these people support themselves?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="343">A: My father still had patients coming and of course we still had some savings, you know, and we were still allowed to use those savings, until a certain time.</sentence><sentence id="344">And of course we lived a very simple life by then, our needs were very small, you couldn't do very much so it was actually just the food you needed.</sentence><sentence id="345">There was not much more you could use for money, you know, for.</sentence><sentence id="346">And, but it really got very bad in 1942, that's when it started getting very bad and where we lived in the <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span>, the notary, which he was the head of the city government, lived in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> as we did, on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, and he had a heart ailment and was very grateful for my father's closeness, he could help him a lot, and I taught his children English and small children, young children, and he came to my father one day, and he said, "You know, doctor, you would do right if you would send your daughter away.</sentence><sentence id="347">Let her ask at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for a travel permit for two weeks absence because we have here a rule that girls between the ages of 15 and 17 will be taken away to some "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>," I mean to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">To my father, didn't sound right, he didn't trust the word "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span>."</sentence><sentence id="349">He just, it was an unknown and he listened to this advice.</sentence><sentence id="350">I went and I got right away permit because I knew all the people there, you know, in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">In better times, long time ago, in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> use to be the gypsies, you know, they stole chickens and carrots and stuff and I had so much pull that I could get the key from the police and let them out after they cried all night.</sentence><sentence id="352">They called after me to let them out so I knew all these people there in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and I got the permit.</sentence><sentence id="353">And my father got in touch with a second cousin in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was bordering this <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, or very close to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="354">And he had a 05:46 daughter approximately my age and was anxious to do something for her safety too.</sentence><sentence id="355">So, he knew about a guide, a man, who for some amount of money would transport people from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="356">He had certain connections to do this.</sentence><sentence id="357">And so, one day, because the girls were suppose to be taken end of March, this was in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="358">And my father accompanied me about middle of March, about a week, we were a week ahead of this rule.</sentence><sentence id="359">I said good-bye to my mother, of course, I couldn't carry more than like a rucksack, on my back.</sentence><sentence id="360">And he accompanied me to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I met this second cousin and the guide and he instructed us that the same evening we would board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we wouldn't speak, we wouldn't sit together, if one would be caught maybe the other could, sort of escape.</sentence><sentence id="361">And we shouldn't speak because our Hungarian wasn't great and if someone was looking for escapees like us, they could, they would readily know that because there were already some girls caught in this way.</sentence><sentence id="362">In fact, my best friend was caught with her cousin and another girl and rode back into the <span class="BUILDING">city jail</span> and transported from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that we found out in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="363">So, of course, we listened to the guide and I have to just mention to you that you would think that I was very unhappy to leave me mother, [interruption] I wasn't that unhappy to leave, because life was pretty sad.</sentence><sentence id="364">Especially the teenager, of energy and your sort of cooped up, there is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, nothing to do, I was getting pretty unhappy, you know, living that way.</sentence><sentence id="365">So this gave me like the opportunity to leave all this, and especially knowing that I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, that was the aim, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> which I use to visit my grandparents and aunts and cousins my age lived there and it was a capital and had lots of fun.</sentence><sentence id="366">So, I thought, great, I'm leaving this horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">And, I didn't know that it might be final, you know, I thought it just a temporary arrangement.</sentence><sentence id="368">So I was pretty cheerful to say good-bye and go, and even to say good-bye to my father and go.</sentence><sentence id="369">And so, we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that night, I think it was around March 17th or so, in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="370">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where we did that was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarik</span> and we rode on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, you know, he purchased our tickets and he was in charge so we didn't have to speak, this guide.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="400">Q: He was just a Slovakian... ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="402">A: He was probably both Slovakian and Hungarian, he got well paid for his efforts and he was supposed to bring us all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> safely, and then report back to the girl's parents and to my parents.</sentence><sentence id="403">Of course, what he did is, the <span class="DLF">road</span> out, not more than forty minutes out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarik</span>(?), (</sentence><sentence id="404">Sered?)</sentence><sentence id="405">and he said, he said he would show with his hand when it's time to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, you know, not use too much words there, you know, and he showed us to get off.</sentence><sentence id="406">So, we all got off, I mean, the girl, my cousin Lily and me and the guide.</sentence><sentence id="407">And then he, there was a <span class="DLF">hay stack</span> right close by and he says, "You get in there now."</sentence><sentence id="408">And we heard some dogs barking and there was on the horizon you could see up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> a big <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and that was already <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="409">And he said, "You know those guards they'll now change for a second, this one guard, and in that second you've got to run into this <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and there's no one there, no guard at that point."</sentence><sentence id="410">Tape #2 So, we giggled in this hay stack, we thought it was a great adventure to do all this, you know, what a fun, you know, and how silly they were, you 05:55 know, and then he told us to now run for it.</sentence><sentence id="411">And we ran into the <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and it was a nice farmer and the guy left us, good-bye, finished.</sentence><sentence id="412">And took most of our <span class="NPIP">things</span> too, that were suppose to be given to us.</sentence><sentence id="413">Some change of clothing and whatever, some shoes, there wasn't that much there and he took his payment and left.</sentence><sentence id="414">I mean, the payment was prepaid.</sentence><sentence id="415">And the farmer pointed to a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, by then we were real tired and we went to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="416">And at daybreak, it was really just daybreak, he told us to look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we feel there were some farmers going with their produce to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, which was really <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="417">And he gave us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> with some vegetables in it and he told us just follow the crowd, go with them, so we did.</sentence><sentence id="418">We did what we were told to do.</sentence><sentence id="419">And we walked and we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galanta</span>, that's where we were heading, and I knew that in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> lived my Aunt, my father's sister, I'd been visiting there before and she had six children, and so, but no one told us the address, they'd forgot, so who are you going to ask?</sentence><sentence id="420">We were afraid to stop anyone, they could be our enemies, any one because even so <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was free of the Germans and German rules yet, but they had rules against aliens, I mean, people come illegally into their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, it was not a rich <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and they couldn't afford to support all these people, there were already refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, they didn't need more than that.</sentence><sentence id="421">So, we were afraid to ask, but then there was light 05:57 in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> because it was just before Passover time, and we saw a bearded Jew, you know, that time a beard meant religious Jew yet, you know, those were the years.</sentence><sentence id="422">And so we dared, we thought he couldn't be a gangster and, of course, it was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, everybody knew each other, and he took us straight to where my family lived.</sentence><sentence id="423">Now, you would think they were swell to see you, wasn't so at all.</sentence><sentence id="424">My Aunt was terrified, she said, "Must be terrible if your father let you go," and "you can't stay here, not even for any time," because her sons were being looked for, they were suppose to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and they were hiding so they didn't need more people hiding there from things, so she dispatched one of her sons that was safer for him to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, that he should be the one to accompany us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="425">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> was loaded with gendarmes and policemen and we were afraid to look, no one should look very much at you.</sentence><sentence id="426">And we found out, at least I did, that running away and being a refugee and even being free from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> didn't mean that much fun, it's pretty scary and sad because really people don't like you that much.</sentence><sentence id="427">And so, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and arrived safely and headed for my <span class="INT_SPACE">grandparents apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="428">Now, you know, my other cousins all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> when they were boys, so I was the only granddaughter living out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, there was a really big celebration every time I would come and visit, which was maybe once or twice a year.</sentence><sentence id="429">But 0 when I came to their <span class="DLF">door</span>, there was no happiness seeing me.</sentence><sentence id="430">Was similar reaction as my Aunt's, things must be very bad and I don't know if you could stay here really, we could be punished.</sentence><sentence id="431">So, they had a long, they were discussing it among themselves what to do, and they figured out that the best would be if I go and stay with my Aunt and her family, which I preferred, because she had two sons, my cousins, they were similar to my age and I was looking for fun, you know.</sentence><sentence id="432">So I went there, and, but when my father returned from the company to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span>, he came back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>, he saw already on the <span class="DLF">Synagogue wall</span> a big poster telling that all the Jews have to gather within a week at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>, they'll be all taken away.</sentence><sentence id="433">And my father didn't wait for that to happen like he didn't wait for me to be caught, and got in touch again with the same guy, even so he didn't do the service he was suppose to do, and asked him to take my father, my mother and him, the same route as he had took me.</sentence><sentence id="434">So I was very surprised one morning, then I saw my parents few days later after I arrived.</sentence><sentence id="435">And they stayed for a few days with my grandparents, but not very long.</sentence><sentence id="436">Now, our situation wasn't as bad as most of the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="437">Number one, my parents spoke perfect Hungarian, my mother was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, my father got his medical degree in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="438">And he was allowed, actually, to practice medicine there.</sentence><sentence id="439">He got a job on the staff of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish General Hospital</span> legally.</sentence><sentence id="440">Illegally, he took again his little black bag and went and visited the refugees who didn't dare to go officially to a doctor, but were very happy to, you know, when my father went to them for a very limited fee.</sentence><sentence id="441">And the other thing was that they took on a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> at a person, they didn't tell her what really their status was, their immigration or legal status was, they just said he's a doctor and he's taking some courses, you know, some excuse.</sentence><sentence id="442">And so, we lived in this <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span>, now the cooking was pretty difficult.</sentence><sentence id="443">My mother could cook on a one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">burner</span>, you know, a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">portable stove</span> and meantimes, I was dispatched to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish restaurant</span> for food, and, I don't know if your familiar with those carriers there, metal, aluminum carriers divided into parts where the soup would be in one <span class="NPIP">part</span>, and the other foods . . .</sentence><sentence id="444">the only problem was, you couldn't go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with it because they were afraid you'd spill it on some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span>, so I had to carry it quite a distance <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, it was quite difficult.</sentence><sentence id="445">And, so they existed that way.</sentence><sentence id="446">My father always was a big stickler for education because that's how he became from a very poor person a successful doctors so education was everything to him and he felt I shouldn't be denied that.</sentence><sentence id="447">So he got in contact with a <span class="BUILDING">girls" Gymnasium</span> 06:03 too and they permitted me, not to attend classes, first of all I didn't speak the Hungarian, they were afraid, you know, for me to go, but they gave me some lessons to learn and I could go and pass exams, and so I continued my education past the sixth grade.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="498">Q: This <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, was this mixed Jewish and non-Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="500">A: It was, it had nothing to do with Jewish, it was a regular <span class="BUILDING">girls" gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="501">It was. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="504">Q: Just a public... 1</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="506">A: Yeah, yeah it was both.</sentence><sentence id="507">It was actually a private girls" gymnasium.</sentence><sentence id="508">The name was Vaszkurlia (ph) was the name of it, woman, man, or whatever, writer or poet or something.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="512">Q: What I'm just trying to get a sense of, I know that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>'s real problems hadn't begun yet, but were there any problems for Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="514">A: No, not for the Hungarian Jews, but they were looking constantly for Jews like us.</sentence><sentence id="515">And they were having conducted razzias, which was, they combed whole <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> really looking for people like us and they put them into <span class="NPIP">holding places</span>, and usually those <span class="NPIP">holding places</span> were <span class="BUILDING">Synagogues</span>.</sentence><sentence id="516">The Jewish community had to support the people that they jailed.</sentence><sentence id="517">And when there were enough of them they would deport them.</sentence><sentence id="518">So, it wasn't easy to be a refugee either.</sentence><sentence id="519">But, as I said, we had it somewhat easier having family there and easier with (re)sources than most people did and I had fun.</sentence><sentence id="520">Through my cousin, I became acquainted with a boy, and we became girlfriend, boyfriend, they taught me how to dance, and, you know, when you seventeen, you really don't care who is looking behind your shoulder, you have to run away at night to hide it's still, you know, was fun.</sentence><sentence id="521">And we lived this way until 1944, Spring of 1944.</sentence><sentence id="522">I have to tell you, that I think from those times on Passover, is not a pleasant holiday for me because all these horrible things always happened just before that.</sentence><sentence id="523">And so, one morning, as I slept, I heard goose steps, and it was Germans marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="524">And we knew that, what we, how we lived till now wouldn't be enough.</sentence><sentence id="525">We would have to do much more to survive.</sentence><sentence id="526">Because my father, being a father, his main concern was me.</sentence><sentence id="527">And he had a patient who was an <span class="BUILDING">ink factory</span> owner.</sentence><sentence id="528">She came from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and married a very rich man there and they lived in a gorgeous <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> that had special, underneath the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> was for the <span class="INT_SPACE">custodian apartment</span> because they were so fancy they had those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span>, I know it has a name that evades me right now, that carried the food from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> up to the, you know, dumbwaiters or something, it's called.</sentence><sentence id="529">So anyways, he became acquainted and their doctor and they told my father the day our familiar visit, <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian office</span> and their family, I think the officer sort of liked them better than his own family and he told them that he knows his wife was looking into a Catholic charity to look for a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to work for her, you know, like a maid.</sentence><sentence id="530">And, maybe I should go there to him and tell them that that's where I was told that they are looking for employment.</sentence><sentence id="531">And my father got me a maid's book.</sentence><sentence id="532">You know, in Europe, you couldn't just go and serve.</sentence><sentence id="533">You had to have your picture, it was like a passport.</sentence><sentence id="534">And you had to have recommendations from your past employers, if you were good, if you were honest, if you were a hard worker.</sentence><sentence id="535">So, I came all dressed up because you know those girls were usually peasant girls who did this kind of work.</sentence><sentence id="536">They were dressed accordingly, they wore thick hose and wore babushka, you know, kerchiefs.</sentence><sentence id="537">And so I got all fixed up, my name changed, I became "Anna Voyachickola", that was my name.</sentence><sentence id="538">And because it was in a sort of Slovak-Hungarian area, even so was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, my not-so-good Hungarian wouldn't be detected that much, it would make sense that I don't speak 100% Hungarian.</sentence><sentence id="539">So, I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span>, was quite far, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> is divided, it's "<span class="ENV_FEATURES">Buda</span>" and "<span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pest</span>" and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Danube</span> divides it, and there are many <span class="DLF">bridges</span> to get to this was in "Buda".</sentence><sentence id="540">And so, I traveled to "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span>" and I was fully accepted as "Anna Voyachickola" and they handed me a lot of hard work that I was 2 really not accustomed to.</sentence><sentence id="541">I had to take rugs, heavy rugs, down into the <span class="DLF">yard</span>, I don't know if your familiar, they sort of made out of bamboo or something and you have to bang the rugs, you put it on one of those hanging . . .</sentence><sentence id="542">they were specially made, and you had to bang those rugs, the dust out, I don't think it worked very well because it just went back and forth, the dust, it didn't suck it out it just moved it from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, but it was hard job and then when you were done you had to again roll it back up and lug it up and, you know, those rugs were at least 12'x 10" or bigger and heavy, so it was no fun.</sentence><sentence id="543">You know, I didn't complain, I did it.</sentence><sentence id="544">And they gave me loads of shirts to iron, I never ironed a shirt in my life, the most I ironed was some handkerchief or maybe some dollies or what, but not long- sleeved shirt that had been starched, and I really didn't know how do you attack these things, how do you go about, but you know, if you have to . . .</sentence><sentence id="545">just do it.</sentence><sentence id="546">I have learned to iron so well I think I could get employment in one of the <span class="BUILDING">shirt places</span>, and, but, my downfall came there when they played some music one day.</sentence><sentence id="547">And as I was dusting, I hummed the music, it was some kind of a Strauss melody and I think I sang it ahead of it's time, and I became very suspect, how does "Anna Voyachickola" know this kind of music, this is not right!</sentence><sentence id="548">But lucky for me, they didn't feel at all that I was a Jewish refugee, they told those people and we found out from the husband because he confided in those friends of my father, they thought I was planted there by Germans, they wanted to know how a Hungarian officer act during their regime.</sentence><sentence id="549">But frankly I didn't go back there anymore, first of all, there was a <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> close by and the allies started bombarding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> very heavily, especially that <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="550">So, many times, I couldn't come back by any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span> I had to walk.</sentence><sentence id="551">And it was tremendous distance after putting in four (full?)</sentence><sentence id="552">hours of hard work, so I didn't go back there anymore.</sentence><sentence id="553">And I, at that time there was a ghetto formed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="554">Few <span class="DLF">Jewish streets</span>, where Jews used to live in some of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> were designated as <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> and many families had to move in

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="603">A: Yeah, early "44.</sentence><sentence id="604">And so, I told my father you know it's very well that you took care of my needs but I am worried about you and mother and I think you should do something too.</sentence><sentence id="605">So he got himself a false identification.</sentence><sentence id="606">He became, his name was Isberg, but now he was Dr.Alakesh and there he was there again for some studies for a few months and they moved into the <span class="INT_SPACE">custodian apartment</span> of these ink manufacturers. [</sentence><sentence id="607">short interruption] 3 Let me back track to 1943.</sentence><sentence id="608">Okay, I missed out on something there.</sentence><sentence id="609">My father tried to find me a furnished room in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> because he didn't want me to live with my parents, he felt if one is caught the other could save himself.</sentence><sentence id="610">And he went with me to the, you know, the advertised rental to this lady, Mrs. Braushaendler (ph), I remember her name in a very nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> not far from where my parents lived, and there were two other girls living.</sentence><sentence id="611">She had a daughter who was a very good seamstress, she was a widow, the mother.</sentence><sentence id="612">And she gave me, it wasn't really a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, it was part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, she just separated a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a sort of curtain and that was where I stayed.</sentence><sentence id="613">And one day, this was in 1943, one day on a Sabbath morning, they were looking, it was a razzia, they were looking for refugees and even so, they didn't look particularly for me, they were looking for others, but they found me.</sentence><sentence id="614">And, they knew right away from conversation with me that I'm a refugee and they gave me just enough time to get dressed, and while I was getting dressed I had enough time to tell the daughter of the lady to please run, I didn't tell her it's my father, they thought it was my Uncle, go and tell my Uncle that I'm being taken away.</sentence><sentence id="615">They didn't know that I was a refugee, those people.</sentence><sentence id="616">So, she notified, she then notified my father and I was taken to, it was a <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span>.</sentence><sentence id="617">And they had some more people like me, there were quite a few people like me.</sentence><sentence id="618">And they kept these people until they had enough and would take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="636">Q: The people you were renting from, did they know you where Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="638">A: Oh sure.</sentence><sentence id="639">Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="640">Oh, you mean the people I was renting from?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="644">Q: That's what I said.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="646">A: Yeah, they knew I was Jewish but didn't know I'm not Hungarian, they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="647">I guess by then maybe my Hungarian improved, I didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="648">But I was being taken into this <span class="NPIP">holding place</span>, and this boyfriend that I had when he found out, he got so upset that he went ... they had a very fancy <span class="BUILDING">store</span> downtown in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, he emptied I think the <span class="INT_SPACE">safe</span> from all the money they had, he was going to buy me out.</sentence><sentence id="649">But of course, it didn't work that way.</sentence><sentence id="650">But anyways, he came to visit, my father couldn't because he wasn't legal, but this boyfriend could.</sentence><sentence id="651">And my father was afraid that I'll be taken away from there, so he found out from a chemist that there is some kind of powder that in large amounts it make bombs, but in very, very small amounts it colors you, like, you would have like symptoms of hepatitis, you'd become all yellow and feverish, and you know <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that were terrified of having an outbreak, and he knew that if 1 get that, I would be taken straight to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish General Hospital</span> where he was on the staff.</sentence><sentence id="652">And he prepared the people there that I would be probably coming as a patient.</sentence><sentence id="653">And he was so right, I took this powder and within hours I turned, like an egg yolk.</sentence><sentence id="654">And the doctor right away dispatched me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="655">And I was truly sick because it was poison and affected all my glands.</sentence><sentence id="656">And, the detectives came there too because there were a few refugees like me already hiding under pretenses, you know, and they got the whiff of it.</sentence><sentence id="657">So, my father taught me how to manipulate the thermometer, it shouldn't go too high, it shouldn't go too low.</sentence><sentence id="658">You know, under the sheet I would rub it because of the quicksilver, you know.</sentence><sentence id="659">It was an old-fashioned kind of 4 thermometer.</sentence><sentence id="660">And so, I was there three weeks, and meanwhile, I had an Uncle living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, my father's brother, who had many friends and he got to get one of his friends to adopt me, so I should be legalized, because I was still under age.</sentence><sentence id="661">And, even so, I never met the man, but as a result, I was able to leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> semi-legalized.</sentence><sentence id="662">I still wasn't allowed to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> under the circumstances but at least I could leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then I lived alone in another <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span>, not where I lived before.</sentence><sentence id="663">So this was until 1944 and then in 1944, of course, the Germans came and there were some places the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and then we took assumed names and after I gave up being "Anna Voyachickola" we all went to hide in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of this custodian of this ink manufacturer.</sentence><sentence id="664">They escaped themselves, so they didn't live there anymore, it was just us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">custodian's apartment</span> living.</sentence><sentence id="665">But after we were there about a week, my father couldn't stand the isolation and being away from his patients, so he took his little black bag and went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where his former patients lived now.</sentence><sentence id="666">And as he was leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, he was accosted by detectives.</sentence><sentence id="667">Still Hungarian, detectives, even though it was occupied by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="668">And they, him and two others they found in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="669">Now, he had in one of his coat pockets his real name and in his other one, his false identification and so, of course, they knew that they caught the right person they were looking for and they took all three of them, two detectives took three captured people into the <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span>, there was a big, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> going in all directions.</sentence><sentence id="670">And in one of the big <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened wide and my father was very resourceful, he tells one of the detectives, "Look!</sentence><sentence id="671">Your guy ran out on you, just now!"</sentence><sentence id="672">and when the other detective looked two of them ran away, so the two detectives remained with one guy.</sentence><sentence id="673">And my father ran all the way where we lived at that time and he told us what happened.</sentence><sentence id="674">We had some supper ready and everything and I said . . .</sentence><sentence id="675">somehow I took over from that point on.</sentence><sentence id="676">I think, when your young you are easier in command of what happen next.</sentence><sentence id="677">And I told my father to shave his mustache and you have to leave.</sentence><sentence id="678">So we went on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, we just grabbed a few of our things and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span>.</sentence><sentence id="679">And we didn't know what to tell him, where do we go?</sentence><sentence id="680">We had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go and we didn't want to endanger anyone with us.</sentence><sentence id="681">So we told him at one point to leave us off, and my father remembered there was someone who was still legal in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and protected, sort of, under protection.</sentence><sentence id="682">Who was at one time his teacher and my father was his doctor and he told him in case of need, you can turn to me.</sentence><sentence id="683">So we knocked on his <span class="DLF">door</span>, because you never knew, will they let you in or not?</sentence><sentence id="684">But he did.</sentence><sentence id="685">And he allowed us to stay.</sentence><sentence id="686">And my father went out to look for something for us to do to, you know, what would be the next step?</sentence><sentence id="687">There weren't many options.</sentence><sentence id="688">And, as he went, he heard a story that today, I think your hair would stand up from disbelief, but he swalowed it and the story was that there are some German Army Officers, or Army personnel, who are disillusioned with the army life and they have their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German army truck</span> and they would take us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="689">Now, part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> was liberated by partisans, very small part of it.</sentence><sentence id="690">And that was where we were going to go.</sentence><sentence id="691">Of course, it cost a lot of money and my father didn't have it, so he tried to organize some more into coming with us.</sentence><sentence id="692">He got 44 people in all, among them was my cousin, the one that I 5 slept in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when I first escaped and her family by then was already taken away because from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> they took families earlier and she knew she was the only one left.</sentence><sentence id="693">And some friends, and there were even two women who were pregnant and had young children, there was all kind of people.</sentence><sentence id="694">And we were suppose to meet the Germans with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> at this little <span class="DLF">park</span> at night.</sentence><sentence id="695">And the Rabbi where we stayed blessed us and we left.</sentence><sentence id="696">And as we were approaching the <span class="DLF">park</span> there were big flood lights turning on us.</sentence><sentence id="697">And we knew right away when there's a secret mission you don't turn on <span class="DLF">flood lights</span> but we couldn't run away anymore, we were caught.</sentence><sentence id="698">And it was no mission of rescue, it was a mission that they were plotting and they hit us, kicked us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>, beat us up.</sentence><sentence id="699">And sped to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span>, that's where it was.</sentence><sentence id="700">Their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was underground of a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, of a real <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for criminals, it had several floors.</sentence><sentence id="701">And the men and women were separated.</sentence><sentence id="702">The men were taken, I think to a <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and the women and children to the <span class="INT_SPACE">fifth floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="703">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> with locked <span class="DLF">doors</span> like criminals and they gave us this little bathing, this little water, barely for eleven people to wash.</sentence><sentence id="704">And for the children they would bring a little better food.</sentence><sentence id="705">And I remember I was so beaten that my nose was bleeding quite badly.</sentence><sentence id="706">And we were all in a state of shock but one of the woman who had a young child was able to tell a story to the child.</sentence><sentence id="707">And somehow that narration and that calmness of that woman put me to sleep and got me relaxed.</sentence><sentence id="708">And so, we were in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and, I just want to mention for a minute, the next morning when they 06:28: opened for a minute the <span class="DLF">jail door</span>, across from our <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> where a young woman was doing exercising, she was in solitary confinement doing head stands and gesticulating to me like this and that, you know, and I had no clue.</sentence><sentence id="709">What's with her and what is her privilege being all alone in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="710">Well, they allowed us about every second day, each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was allowed to go down to the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> under the guards" supervision to walk around in circles and this young woman, being on our <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> joined me in this walk.</sentence><sentence id="711">And she told me, you probably heard of her, her name was Hanna Senesh, she was a parachutist trained by the English to come and rescue some people and she was caught by the Croats in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> on the <span class="DLF">border</span> and brought here with the other parachutists friends, and she wouldn't tell on the others and of course she was being interrogated and she knew for sure she will be hung after a while, but it was a privilege for me, even for a short while, to meet her because she was a very courageous woman.</sentence><sentence id="712">But anyway, we stayed in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for about three to four weeks and after that we were again ordered to go down these <span class="DLF">stairs</span> with whatever belongings we had and come to the main <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and for the first time I felt like the men came there too, the few who were jailed, including my father.</sentence><sentence id="713">He was handcuffed with one hand to another man with his hand so the two men were always together no matter what.</sentence><sentence id="714">And his hand was quite swollen from the handcuffs.</sentence><sentence id="715">And there were a lot of trustees in this <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, there were manufacturers, Jews, who were the first ones to be put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and they 6 acted like trustees so I asked one, "Where are we being taken to?"</sentence><sentence id="716">He said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="717">And by then, even we weren't sure what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was but we knew it's a place you don't come back from.</sentence><sentence id="718">And so it wasn't a very pleasant idea to be there, but I found a postcard in my purse that they returned to me, they took it when we got to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, and I found a pen and I wrote to my boyfriend, even so I didn't put his address just his name so I didn't know how he might get it, but I wrote that we are being taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and then we were marched, we were twenty-seven people not all Jews.</sentence><sentence id="719">Among us were non-Jews, the women and children remained behind that were not being taken.</sentence><sentence id="720">We were marched to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and we were called political prisoners" because we wanted to escape the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="721">And put on regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with guards in each <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span>, and there were guards on the roof of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> too.</sentence><sentence id="722">And, they found the card, the Germans found my card and they were running around with it, holding it high up in all <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span>, walking around, that, of course my mother knew who it was because she knew the name it was directed to.</sentence><sentence id="723">But of course the person never got it, I just, the reason I wrote it I just didn't want to disappear without anyone knowing that, where we are being taken.

explained why.</sentence><sentence id="972">When I was about 15 I had a chance to go on a Youth Aliya to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, which I wanted to do, and he wouldn't permit me because the morals weren't good there, you know, bad reputation, and he just wouldn't let me go, and he asked for forgiveness, if he would have let me go, I wouldn't have gotten here.</sentence><sentence id="973">And he promised then and then, that if we get out of there, he'll never interfere in my decisions, and he never did.</sentence><sentence id="974">So, we said good-bye to the men, just saw them from a distance being led away, and couple guards led us away.</sentence><sentence id="975">And we were approaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Birkenau</span>, they preferred it be called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and it had the famous inscription, which still I believed, until I got in, "Arbeit Macht Frei" which means "Work Makes You Free."</sentence><sentence id="976">And this is the biggest lie, there were high voltage wires, and let me give you the impression 0 when I saw and entered this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="977">As I walked within the <span class="DLF">door</span>, walked after us, my first impression was, and I looked around because this was not a normal <span class="NPIP">place</span> you could tell, that I died, this is true, and I woke up in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span>, I must have been a very bad person to wake up bad(ly) punished, to come to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this.</sentence><sentence id="978">Because the people that I saw there were not human looking.</sentence><sentence id="979">Young men with shaven heads, with glazed eyes, with funny clothes.</sentence><sentence id="980">They just moved in a crazy way and then the Germans shouting, they had two words, they were key words, "Raus" and "Schnell," "out" and "fast."</sentence><sentence id="981">And lucky were us that we understood German, if you didn't then you were readily kicked or pushed and, you know, the scene was that there were turrets with guards and the guns were pointing towards the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="982">There were <span class="DLF">chimneys</span>, unusual <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> with unusual smoke coming out of them.</sentence><sentence id="983">And I caught hold of a young girl who looked a little normal and I tried to inquire, you know, you have learned very fast not to ask for much and talk too much, this was not good, but I dared to ask, I said: "You know, in 1942 many of my friends I think they were brought here."</sentence><sentence id="984">And I mentioned my best friend's name, maybe you know her name was Helga Fayhee (ph)?</sentence><sentence id="985">So she points toward this <span class="DLF">chimney</span> with the huge smoke, you could smell the flesh from that smoke, and said "That's were they all are, including your friend."</sentence><sentence id="986">I didn't know what she was talking about, then.</sentence><sentence id="987">And then everything "Schnell!</sentence><sentence id="988">Schnell!,"</sentence><sentence id="989">so of course, everything was taken from us even little what we had, and "Schnell!</sentence><sentence id="990">Schnell!,"</sentence><sentence id="991">we were chased into what they called "the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span>."</sentence><sentence id="992">It isn't a <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> that you picture, it was a huge <span class="NPIP">place</span> with showers, and they were real showers.</sentence><sentence id="993">We had to totally undress which was very unusual, in Europe in those days people just didn't undress in front of strangers, there were men there too who shaved us every <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they sprayed disinfectant on us and they, they handed us this soap that had initials.</sentence><sentence id="994">It said RJF.</sentence><sentence id="995">And RJF meant Rein Juedisch Fett, translated Clean Jewish Fat.</sentence><sentence id="996">In other words, the soap was made from the victims, everything was utilized there.</sentence><sentence id="997">And of course, we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="998">So they turned on the showers and "Schnell!</sentence><sentence id="999">Schnell!"</sentence><sentence id="1000">we had to soap ourselves, and we hardly rinsed ourselves, they didn't give you enough time, and "Schnell!</sentence><sentence id="1001">Schnell!"</sentence><sentence id="1002">you have to get your clothes.</sentence><sentence id="1003">Now, you didn't get your clothes, you got what was thrown there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1004">If it fit or didn't fit, made no difference, it's not, it's as soon as it's "Schnel!."</sentence><sentence id="1005">Now you can imagine how I felt seeing my mother in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and probably she also felt seeing me, but I have to tell you that as soon as we got there, she was not my mother anymore in a practical way.</sentence><sentence id="1006">She became the child and I was the mother.</sentence><sentence id="1007">She just couldn't function in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1008">And, so my allotment of clothes was a black dress with short sleeves, and no underclothes at all.</sentence><sentence id="1009">The shoes were the most dire thing because they usually didn't fit, no one measured you, and if they were very bad, if the fitting was totally out, you were doomed because most of the time you were on your feet.</sentence><sentence id="1010">There were no <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you could sit or anything.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And many people died on account just not having the right shoes.</sentence><sentence id="1012">Your feet swell or were so hurt that they couldn't continue, but my shoes were acceptable.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And they were both the same size, both the same heel because it didn't have to be.</sentence><sentence id="1014">You could have had the right foot in the wrong, you know, different size than the left foot, or different heel.</sentence><sentence id="1015">So, then "Schnel!Schnel!"</sentence><sentence id="1016">they painted a red stripe on our backs because they without this you could maybe escape, which was ridiculous.</sentence><sentence id="1017">I don't know how they imagined that.</sentence><sentence id="1018">Then they gave us, over our left chest, describing us, what kind of prisoners we are.</sentence><sentence id="1019">And then there were <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> ... 1</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1072">Q: What did yours say?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1074">A: Jew, you know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1076">Q: Was it a special designation for political prisoner, or?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1078">A: Not here.</sentence><sentence id="1079">Not here.</sentence><sentence id="1080">But then there were <span class="BUILDING">stations</span>, you know, where you went through like, when you go to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> or something you have to go through, and there were girls tattooing people because, you know, you lost your name the minute you arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, now, I had already two names that weren't mine.</sentence><sentence id="1081">First my cousin's, when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galanta</span> they gave me my cousin's name to really legalize, then I became "Anna Voyachickola" and I lost my name altogether because everybody was called out by number, and my number was one number higher than my mother's.</sentence><sentence id="1082">The irony of it is, my mother was such an esthetic person that she checked each girl that did the best job in tattooing and she found that this one who did me did the most beautiful job, and I really never saw a nicer tattoo, if you can call it nice. [</sentence><sentence id="1083">Shows tattoo] And then I got this triangle which meant "political prisoner".</sentence><sentence id="1084">Now the girls told me "Your lucky," the ones that tattooed me, "you have a living number."</sentence><sentence id="1085">I said, "What do you mean by that?"</sentence><sentence id="1086">And she said, "Well, if you don't have an "A" or a "B", that means that this number is as many people as there were now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and your the first one with this number."</sentence><sentence id="1087">The people who had "A's" meant that one person already died with that number.</sentence><sentence id="1088">The person who had "B" there were two who had died with that number.</sentence><sentence id="1089">So, and they have to give it to me because I was political prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1090">Now, I didn't know really that I was political prisoner until I visited a year and a half ago 06:51: the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and there are arms with this number and the explanation that, in the beginning, it was non-Jews or old men who had this.</sentence><sentence id="1091">Then there were men who were Jews and there were very few women who had this.</sentence><sentence id="1092">I'm distinguished with this triangle pointing the I am political prisoner.</sentence><sentence id="1093">But you didn't want to be called your number, you were afraid to be called that was the biggest fear everyone because when they called your number it meant death most of the time.</sentence><sentence id="1094">So, after we were tattooed, then "Schnell!</sentence><sentence id="1095">Schnell!,"</sentence><sentence id="1096">they ran us through what was like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>, a wooden structure, and there were hundreds and thousands of them because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was divided into A-B-C-D-E-F. We were in "A" camp, we were the . . .</sentence><sentence id="1097">we just came and I think they waited for the visas for something, they kept you in sort of isolation for a short while and there was <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> maybe for 100 people in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, we were 400 in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1098">And where we slept were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>, three-tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1099">The way you have it in your <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> there are no, we had no straw, we had no sheets, no pillows, no blankets and there was space for maybe three people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> to stretch out, we were eight.</sentence><sentence id="1100">If one person wanted to turn 2 sometime during the night all eight had to turn because there just was no way that it could be accomplished, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> whatsoever.</sentence><sentence id="1101">And at 2:00 AM they would wake us up with their flashlight, again "Schnell!</sentence><sentence id="1102">Schnell!," "</sentence><sentence id="1103">Raus!"</sentence><sentence id="1104">Raus!"</sentence><sentence id="1105">And we would have to stand, everyone in front of the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> and then we would look out into <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span>, we saw these repeated, in front of each <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span>, it was like black from the people, women, standing there, and the magic number was five, you stood five in width and five in length.</sentence><sentence id="1106">The best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stand, it depended how you ran out, you know, where you got your <span class="NPIP">place</span>, was in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="1107">Number one, you were protected from being seen; number two, if it was cold and windy, the people somehow enclosed you.</sentence><sentence id="1108">But, one day, as we were standing, you could stand there for hours regardless of the weather, hours and hours until it didn't jive all the numbers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1109">And the people who didn't stand in the <span class="DLF">front line</span> had to have their arms up over their shoulders.</sentence><sentence id="1110">There was a person who was in charge of each <span class="DLF">block</span>, the <span class="DLF">block</span> "Aelteste," the block elder, and she would tell you "Rensid Naramana," you know they spoke Polish, but knowing Slovak so it was sort of, you know, I could figure out what they meant.</sentence><sentence id="1111">And you know, if you tried just for five minutes to keep your arms at that, in that <span class="NPIP">position</span>, you feel like you don't have arms.</sentence><sentence id="1112">And if you have to do it five hours then you can imagine what it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1150">Q: What did that mean, what they were saying .. . ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1152">A: "Arms on the shoulders."</sentence><sentence id="1153">And, at that time they distributed your rations.</sentence><sentence id="1154">Now the ration was bread, piece of bread, that was made mostly out of sawdust and some brown liquid.</sentence><sentence id="1155">Now, I didn't have even my own cup, so I had to use from everyone, what everybody else used, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1156">Lucky for my mother and me, the people found out that we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they knew who we were, some people yet from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and others, and they brought a sweater for my mother and they brought some bread for me when we arrived, which was very pleasant to be welcomed, even there to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And the thing was to adapt, which my father, that was his main teaching in my life as a child.</sentence><sentence id="1158">To be flexible and to adapt.</sentence><sentence id="1159">And I was able to do it, instead of like some, and they were very detested by the old prisoners, we called them "Alter Haeftling," means "old prisoner" and there were the new prisoners which, you know, they felt they still had a good life for a while, which was their right, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1160">They came and started complaining to this "old heflinck" if they detested you.</sentence><sentence id="1161">But if you adapted, they helped you.</sentence><sentence id="1162">And I adapted.</sentence><sentence id="1163">If I knew that I have to wash <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a bucket so I washed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in a bucket.</sentence><sentence id="1164">And I offered to work.</sentence><sentence id="1165">There was a job called "stubendienst", "Stube" means "<span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>," "Dienst" means "service," so it's room service.</sentence><sentence id="1166">In this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, they took great care to paint the tiles red, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1167">They broke bricks to make the color with water.</sentence><sentence id="1168">And I offered to help and I had an advantage with that, that they let my mother lie up after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were fixed and she could lie there and rest, so that was my advantage.</sentence><sentence id="1169">And we worked hard, and one time, we had to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, it was called "Aussenkommando" , meaning "working <span class="NPIP">outside</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1170">So after we stood we'd file out there and got our ration, there were an orchestra playing for us.</sentence><sentence id="1171">There was an orchestra at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that led <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with the vicious dogs on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> playing a march for us to march out.</sentence><sentence id="1172">And I remember seeing a rotten apple as I walked and I was dying to have that rotten apple and one of the guards just kicked it away before I could get it.</sentence><sentence id="1173">And as 3 we walked, I saw a little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span>, I guess some of the guards lived, seeing some steam coming out and shade, by biggest dream was to live in such a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span>, to be away from everyone because you were never alone, you couldn't wash by yourself there are millions of things in the <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1174">You couldn't run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> alone, there were latrines that you sat back to back with people.</sentence><sentence id="1175">It's nice to be with people but it's nice to be alone.</sentence><sentence id="1176">And you never had that, something that was your own.</sentence><sentence id="1177">And in the 06:60 Aussenkommando we had to cut bushes down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> which was the main river of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1178">It was pretty chilly by then, it was the end of September and October, it's very cold there, the climate is horrible there.</sentence><sentence id="1179">There's malaria there, it's a bad climate.</sentence><sentence id="1180">And one of the guards, he was a Hungarian that was taken in, he took pity on me and gave me his food, and I asked him why, if your doing it he could be killed by that, and he said, "I don't want to be here, really, I didn't wanna be here.</sentence><sentence id="1181">Where I lived there was some Jewish family who were very good to my family and I want to pay it back."</sentence><sentence id="1182">And things like that gave you extra strength, that you saw that the world didn't go completely cuckoo, you know, that there are some humans even here who are decent.</sentence><sentence id="1183">That sort of gave you courage, and the other thing was that my father kept in touch with me through human messages, telling me where he was.</sentence><sentence id="1184">He worked very hard, he had to carry <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> and got a double- sided hernia because he didn't know how to carry.</sentence><sentence id="1185">He had to shine trumpets, polish instruments for the musicians.</sentence><sentence id="1186">He had to put up hard shoe polish, I understand.</sentence><sentence id="1187">But then at the end, some of the people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> who had been old prisoners, because the old prisoners, you know, it was . . .</sentence><sentence id="1188">there were 07:02 people at higher ranks and some old prisoners had higher ranks.</sentence><sentence id="1189">The Germans trusted them and gave them jobs to do.</sentence><sentence id="1190">And some of them were able to get my father to become a doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> taking care of the prisoners.</sentence><sentence id="1191">So his life had improved a great deal, he didn't have to stand Zell Appell.</sentence><sentence id="1192">We got better food.</sentence><sentence id="1193">Some of the prisoners who got cigarettes they would give to him and because he didn't smoke, he was able to exchange it for food.</sentence><sentence id="1194">And he would send me a tomato sometimes, which was a gift unthinkable.</sentence><sentence id="1195">And, those things kept you going.</sentence><sentence id="1196">And then I heard there was woman, her position was "Schreiber" or Writer [secretary?],</sentence><sentence id="1197">and that was the highest position a Jew could have.</sentence><sentence id="1198">She spoke several languages, she was very smart.</sentence><sentence id="1199">And her position was to be in charge of all the accountings, of all the Zell Appells and responsible for it.</sentence><sentence id="1200">That the numbers jived and are correct.</sentence><sentence id="1201">Now that was a very responsible position.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And she found out that under this number who is the name, and one day she came to us, she wants to help.</sentence><sentence id="1203">She called the number and I was terrified that the number was called.</sentence><sentence id="1204">And I said, "Why do you want to help?,"</sentence><sentence id="1205">you know, even from Jews you become suspicious.</sentence><sentence id="1206">And she told me that her sister, and I knew who she was talking about, her name was "Goldstein," lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and she resembled her a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1207">She said, they were I remember big Zionist, her sister and brother- in-law and the two children, and my father saved the sister's life and the child in childbirth.</sentence><sentence id="1208">4 And even they don't live anymore, but she wants to help us through it.</sentence><sentence id="1209">So, you know, I always say you never know in your life when you help someone who benefits from that help.</sentence><sentence id="1210">It might be someone totally unrelated or, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1211">And so, she wanted . . .</sentence><sentence id="1212">her help was to give us job in the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span>, that was a big job!</sentence><sentence id="1213">Because if you worked there, you got double portions but I said "I really appreciate the job, but it's one job I just can't do," you know because, they were just holes and you take a stick and clean it with a stick and no matter how hungry I was, that was something I just couldn't bear to do.</sentence><sentence id="1214">So I thanked her a lot and had to give up.</sentence><sentence id="1215">But then one day I heard that about forty-two girls that came in "42 with the original <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that I escaped, you know, when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, are being taken out to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was called I think "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz II"</span> but I heard later it was called the Statsgebaeude, which means "a <span class="BUILDING">state building</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1216">It was just an hour or less walk from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span>, but the circumstances were compared like from <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> to <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span>, you know, compared to the situation.</sentence><sentence id="1217">So I again was pretty courageous, you know, they had alarms, block alarm.</sentence><sentence id="1218">Block alarm meant between each A-B-C-D there were <span class="DLF">electric gates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1219">And then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came, they locked these <span class="DLF">gates</span> so that you shouldn't see wants going on, or shouldn't tell those people where they are being taken because if two, three hundred people come and they find out and they started to fight, you couldn't do the killing job properly and, well.</sentence><sentence id="1220">But I went through this alarm before the <span class="DLF">gate</span> closed to her where she was, and I said, "Now, you wanted to help us once, maybe you could help us now.</sentence><sentence id="1221">I heard these girls are being taken there, maybe you could include my mother and me in that group," and she did.</sentence><sentence id="1222">And that was a big, big help.</sentence></p></dialogue>

how you feel the guy told him and so he saw me there, and I knew that one of the doctors was not a doctor who was treating me, I could tell.</sentence><sentence id="1507">And so he asked that someone else could treat me which the real doctor did.</sentence><sentence id="1508">And he took time, of course, to get better in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like that.</sentence><sentence id="1509">And I became friends with someone who was hiding there because they wanted to make on her medical experiments and she came in "42, the same time my husband's sister went.</sentence><sentence

would just stay.</sentence><sentence id="1840">And I developed fever, I got like red lines on my legs, it was all from hunger.</sentence><sentence id="1841">And so, I knew we couldn't live much longer there, you know, no energy, it was hard to just move or get up.</sentence><sentence id="1842">We didn't do work there, but we weren't fed either, I mean, just water, sort of, or liquid.</sentence><sentence id="1843">But then, after it was May, it was actually May 2nd, we looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span>, it was a lovely day, and we saw our guards looked

fell.</sentence><sentence id="1849">And one of the guards just waited until she put it in her mouth and shot her.</sentence><sentence id="1850">And they had potatoes and vegetables dug in the <span

us.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And, after we were free, we really didn't feel that free.</sentence><sentence id="1853">No one came there, none of the American army who freed this <span

that they are left alone, that all their loved ones were killed off and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them to come back to.</sentence><sentence id="1857">I had my mother to take care of and I had became friends with two other girls, one was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>, one was from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1858">And we befriended each other in this particular <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1859">And they moved out together into the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were occupied before by the workers.</sentence><sentence id="1860">So each had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, and there was one very energetic girl that I met after the war and became friends with and had her mother there too, she had the energy to take a big pot of water and boil potatoes which was the best thing for our stomachs.</sentence><sentence id="1861">Some girls ran into this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that was there that was loaded with Red Cross packages that was suppose to be given to the French prisoners of war and never was, and they got deathly sick.</sentence><sentence id="1862">They got such diarrhea that some died.</sentence><sentence id="1863">My mother suffered from chronic diarrhea, even from the potatoes, she was so

id="1868">And they were sort of looking around, and there were some German army personnel with them and it seemed like they were looking for something, so I went to them, and I said, "Could I help you?"</sentence><sentence id="1869">And they said, "Yes, tell them to throw down their arms," which I did with pleasure, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1870">And, as I went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I saw even a nicer scene, I saw the American Army on both sides of the time walk and the Germans walking the middle throwing their arms in front.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And the prisoners made a thing like a <span class="BUILDING">carnival</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, they ransacked the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span>, they stole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, they just walked on, they thought it belongs to them.</sentence><sentence id="1872">They took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby buggies</span> and loaded them with whatever they could take, and I just wondered where they were going with all that.</sentence><sentence id="1873">We entered a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span>, and you know this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was totally undamaged, the war never entered this <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1874">So we entered a <span class="BUILDING">German house</span>, the inhabitants were nicely sitting around their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, eating, and the only question was, "Are the Russians coming?</sentence><sentence id="1875">They were not afraid of the Americans, terrified of the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1876">I said, "We have no idea who's coming, you know, but we would like some food," and they let us go by ourselves in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> that was loaded from floor to top with food.</sentence><sentence id="1877">And we helped ourselves, with canned things.</sentence><sentence id="1878">And one smart, and there was some fabric, I remember there was a red and white sort of cotton fabric, that my girlfriend from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> she was a fantastic seamstress, she tore it and made a skirt out of it for me.</sentence><sentence id="1879">And I came in that skirt back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> actually.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And one girl was very smart and took couple bottles of drinks, I would have never thought of it, which was very helpful to us because right after the Germans liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, two days later it became the <span class="REGION">Russian 6 zone</span>, and the Russian soldiers were totally ungentlemen-like.</sentence><sentence id="1881">They wanted to rape us, no matter what condition we were in.</sentence><sentence id="1882">We hardly could escape them, and we decided we are leaving, we didn't know how, but we knew that the Americans are next door.</sentence><sentence id="1883">We walked out of there.</sentence><sentence id="1884">They wouldn't let us through.</sentence><sentence id="1885">But then when we showed our drinks, the bottle of drinks that pacified them, they let us through.</sentence><sentence id="1886">And we actually, probably came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American Zone</span> again because it interchanged, sort of.</sentence></p></dialogue>

class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1996">Actually, we really enjoyed this walk because it was for the first time that you walked and no one said, Schnell and Raus.</sentence><sentence id="1997">You don't realize what it is, just to walk and no one chasing you.</sentence><sentence id="1998">And then we saw the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span>, which until then, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had absolutely nothing of nature, and we heard birds that . . .</sentence><sentence id="1999">it's so delightful when you haven't heard it for such a long time, just a nice voice instead of those harsh, horrible voices.</sentence><sentence id="2000">But then all of a sudden we heard shots and we thought, oh God, they're after us now.</sentence><sentence id="2001">But before we had a chance to be really that scared, we saw American, people in American army uniform running out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they saw us and saw how we looked all scared and, you know, and they said, "It's the end of the War, end of World War II.</sentence><sentence id="2002">We are celebrating."</sentence><sentence id="2003">It was May the 8th, end of World War II and they were shooting in the <span class="DLF">air</span>, celebrating.</sentence><sentence id="2004">And we walked sort of with them to the next

understand it was a summer place for one of the King Ludwig and you could see his <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> there on top and the American soldiers were in charge of the <span

class="BUILDING">houses</span> and asked them to give up one of their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> for us.</sentence><sentence id="2006">And they brought us some food and some clothes.</sentence><sentence id="2007">And I remember going into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, it had a little <span class="DLF">pond</span>, sort of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> or <span class="DLF">pond</span>, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> around it, and I found a book with German poetry, and I just enjoyed sitting on this

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that is heading toward <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, and so we asked them to take us on it.</sentence><sentence id="2010">Our first stop was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, sort of, that was set up by a, I didn't know then U.S.O. personnel.</sentence><sentence id="2011">There were women and men and they were serving on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, I remember, with napkins and, you know, it was first normal setting of some kind of a food.</sentence><sentence id="2012">And one soldier who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>, I know, I wish I would have remembered his name, gave my mother his food ration.</sentence><sentence id="2013">He said he wishes, you know, he hoped that if his mother would need something like that, they would give it to her.</sentence><sentence id="2014">And he gave us a special little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, just a <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span>, for us to sleep there.</sentence><sentence id="2015">But the next day, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> moved on and it stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Celle</span>, which was again I think Eastern . .</sentence><sentence id="2016">.no, actually, it belonged to the English, it was the <span class="REGION">English zone</span>, you know there were so many <span class="REGION">zones</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2017">This was the <span class="REGION">English zone</span>, it was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP Camp</span> already.</sentence><sentence id="2018">And they made me a, like the camp translator, so they gave me a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with my two friends and my mother, and I found a doctor who told me the best thing for my mother is toast and tea.</sentence><sentence id="2019">They wanted to keep me 9 in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there but I didn't want to go.</sentence><sentence id="2020">And there were Czech partisans and Slovak partisans, this is what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> started with.</sentence><sentence id="2021">And there were some who were like in big <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> sleeping in, but we had our little <span class="INT_SPACE">private area</span> which was very nice.</sentence><sentence id="2022">And we recuperated, even so I still had that hunger symptoms, this red streak and fever.</sentence><sentence id="2023">And then I heard that there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and there were Gypsies, many Gypsies in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and a lot of Gypsies.</sentence><sentence id="2024">And I found out that from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> they're sending a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> for some of the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> who were there, prisoners, to bring them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2025">And there were only so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> for, you know, the people were named because there were no gasoline, you couldn't find gasoline.</sentence><sentence id="2026">So, I went again to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, whatever, in charge of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> an Englishman, and I said, "Could you do me favor?</sentence><sentence id="2027">I brought my mother through all this, I don't want her to perish now.</sentence><sentence id="2028">I have to get closer to better health for her, could you get us on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="2029">And he did.</sentence><sentence id="2030">So we got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, and actually, I was helpful because they stopped it because they were going from one <span class="REGION">zone</span> to another and they didn't want to let it go through.</sentence><sentence id="2031">So then I spoke to them, "Is there any other way?"</sentence><sentence id="2032">There was a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> so we took the <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> and we got through and I remember, our first night we slept <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.512185" long="11.993891">Halle</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and there were some students who gave up their <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us to sleep and, I never forget, it was the first fresh coffee for breakfast and some regular breakfast, and then we went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and we were brought the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross building</span>, or where ever the Red Cross was, and they gave us money and food and they had already had posted some people survived, so we looked, you know, any

the first seating went to the survivors, only then could everyone else sit down.</sentence><sentence id="2036">And so we sat down and got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span>, the
