<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3">A: My full name is William Luksenburg.</sentence><sentence id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dombrova</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="5">Was born on February the Ist, 1923.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Can you tell me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you were born in and about your family and your early recollections?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="11">A: The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I was born in was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mining town</span>, coal mining and smelters.</sentence><sentence id="12">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we lived, it was comparatively not as many Jews as other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around us, and we...at at that time I had a big family, father, mother, just older brothers, but the family from my mother's side and my father's side was quite...a family about fifty, sixty people, which only me and distant cousins...two cousins are alive in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and one in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and from my family I'm the only one left alive.</sentence><sentence id="13">My recollection and my upbringing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dombrova</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="14">I attended <span class="BUILDING">grade schools</span> which were run by, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> we didn't have separation state and <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, and therefore the <span class="BUILDING">Polish grade schools</span> were run by the Catholic lay teachers, nuns and priests, most of them...very few laymen teachers and I want to bring it out because we had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> on Saturdays, but me my parents being orthodox and we could not...my father would forbid us to attend <span class="BUILDING">Saturday schools</span>, and what happened that this...the that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday what we had they usually would take...they would take new subject on Saturday and I think it was because just in spite anti-Semitic overtones and anyway I would come in Monday back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">My <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> teacher or my classmates would not let me in what was the 01:03: new subject on Saturday, so for me going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, it was very hard because by the time I rolled in by Friday I caught up only with the new subject.</sentence><sentence id="16">Friday rolled in.</sentence><sentence id="17">Saturday was a day off for me.</sentence><sentence id="18">Also another thing...we had to attend <span class="BUILDING">mass</span> every Sunday morning, the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="19">We had our...in uniform, the head it was shaving...the hair was shaved and we marched to to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every morning and of course the Jewish boys had to march too.</sentence><sentence id="20">Of course we didn't go into the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="21">We...a few of us standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and that brought back memories I remember because we're like outcasts...the Jews and all, and said let us go, not to attend the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">We were to attend the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday even though we stood <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">Remembering some episodes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>...we had some singing lessons.</sentence><sentence id="24">We had high priests coming sometimes visit our <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, our prelate and they would...we would sing religious songs.</sentence><sentence id="25">We had a teacher who played the fiddle, and he would...said sing.</sentence><sentence id="26">He would play along as we were sang, and we...we sang the religious songs.</sentence><sentence id="27">Well, I didn't feel like singing religious songs because I was not... was brought up orthodox and I felt it was sacriligious to sing songs</sentence><sentence id="29">like that, but I kept my mouth 01:05: shut and he saw that I was not singing properly and he walked between the rows in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and then got behind me and hit me with his bow hard into my...on my head and he said, .</sentence><sentence id="30">Will you Jew sing?</sentence><sentence id="31">And something like this...it's kind of stands out in your mind and other episodes were as merchants and Pollack would stay in front of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and say .</sentence><sentence id="32">Don't...don't buy from a Jew because they were...we were quite persecuted in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="33">The upbringing in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was very hard for us Jews.</sentence><sentence id="34">Matter of fact when Hitler came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, he was very surprised.</sentence><sentence id="35">We were hardened by that because when...and during when Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, a lot of the German Jews committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="36">When he came to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, although we had the same hard times, maybe harsher, but we were hardened people already and we didn't commit suicide.</sentence><sentence id="37">We just stood our ground and took it sort of.</sentence><sentence id="38">And otherwise I remember another incident when my mother was an educated woman and she had a lot of Polish friends because the...she was brought to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> with them and so on.</sentence><sentence id="39">She make friends.</sentence><sentence id="40">The reason I'm saying that why is during the war, during the <span

would not allow me.</sentence><sentence id="285">She said what ever's going to happen to you, it's going...go to us, going to happen to you.</sentence><sentence id="286">At that time we did not

why don't you take...at that time we wear arm band...she said why don't your arm band off.</sentence><sentence id="299">By the way, if you...if they caught you without an arm band and you are a Jew, you could be shot on the spot.</sentence><sentence id="300">That was a death sentence.</sentence><sentence id="301">And I took my arm band off and I went <span

have any bread.</sentence><sentence id="305">Leave.</sentence><sentence id="306">And I remember coming back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and again my mother was so disappointed that her best friend wouldn't give her child a loaf of bread, because she was sure they had lots of it and again I remember my mother then had disappointment and she was crying over it.</sentence><sentence id="307">Life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was...had gotten to be so unbearable people would...would get up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and and almost live on the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and there were terrible times and then we all realized it was really their own people.</sentence><sentence id="308">In 1942 they had all the people gather into a <span class="BUILDING">sports arena</span> on the threat of that anybody be found at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> would be shot on the spot and people would put</sentence><sentence id="310">on their Sunday best, very best, and they go out with...they not really know what to expect but when when you...nothing good would come out that they want us out there, and I remember we went over to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> where the German sat and he made right and left, "rechts und links".</sentence><sentence id="311">I went this way and my parents went and I never see them again.</sentence><sentence id="312">The only thing I got from my mother...she left a note for me through one of these militias to deliver to me where she described where we had hidden some
