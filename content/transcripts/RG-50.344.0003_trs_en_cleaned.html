we were sort of shielded from that and -- and really didn't see as much as in those photographs.</sentence><sentence id="1219">So, it's hard to say.</sentence><sentence id="1220">And I mean, I happen to be German and I have relatives over there.</sentence><sentence id="1221">I have never talked to them about it.</sentence><sentence id="1222">Well, they -- the younger ones, born way after, you

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1388">Q: Before you went <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1390">A: Before I went over.</sentence><sentence id="1391">You know, we had 10,000 prisoners there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dupont</span> and when we were on night duty, we worked from seven pm to seven am, 12 hours.</sentence><sentence id="1392">And then you got an extra day off for that.</sentence><sentence id="1393">You did that for two weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1394">So the prisoners, when they -- when we were preparing for them, we had just a very small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with three <span

id="1396">We had quite a big <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there, but it was empty.</sentence><sentence id="1397">So they put their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ward</span> as far away as you could go.</sentence><sentence id="1398">How I wished I had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller skates</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1399">Cause you had to go down there and gave out -- you put out the medicines.</sentence><sentence id="1400">I put them in all little medicine glasses with the name of the person.</sentence><sentence id="1401">Cause we had a ward man who was German.</sentence><sentence id="1402">He gave out all the medicines, he did everything except the narcotics and the injections.</sentence><sentence id="1403">So he called me one night, it was pouring rain and he said, ""We're being flooded down here."</sentence><sentence id="1404">And -- because I could understand him, you see?</sentence><sentence id="1405">And so -- and -- and one of the duties of the night nurse was to run across an open <span class="DLF">ramp</span> into the <span class="INT_SPACE">nurses quarters</span> and close all the <span

just came down, you can't imagine.</sentence><sentence id="1408">And so I had just come back from the <span class="INT_SPACE">nurses quarters</span> -- you ran into everybody's <span

and they had all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> pulled to the center and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was wet.</sentence><sentence id="1416">There were a couple of inches of water on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and everything, the bed linen was wet.</sentence><sentence id="1417">I know I had to go back and get more bed linen, cause they didn't have enough, because they didn't use that much, you know, at one time.</sentence><sentence id="1418">And -- and they got me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> -- oh, and we had bars on all the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1419">Not regular <span class="DLF">bars</span>, but screening, that metal screening, each one with a lock and they were not in

the next <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1422">By then somebody moved the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, I got up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span>, got that <span class="DLF">window</span> o -- closed -- and the next one.</sentence><sentence id="1423">So finally I said, "For heavens sakes, will you find the right key?</sentence><sentence id="1424">Go down while I'm working on this <span class="DLF">window</span> and you get that lock for that <span class="DLF">window</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1425">Well, and we had one <span

says, "There is absolutely no sense to what you people have done."</sentence><sentence id="1429">I said, "First of all, you don't need those metal screens on those <span class="DLF">windows</span>, that's asinine."</sentence><sentence id="1430">I said, "And if they get out of the <span class="DLF">window</span>, how are they going to go further?"</sentence><sentence id="1431">Because there were

id="1442">Everything was off those <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1443">That I remember vividly.</sentence><sentence id="1444">Well, anyhow, while I was jumping from one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> to the other, one of them says, in German, he said, "She's like the little old lady who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn't know what to do."</sentence><sentence id="1445">Well, I burst out laughing, I couldn't help it.</sentence><sentence id="1446">And I was supposed to be very stern, you see, they were our

young.</sentence><sentence id="1455">And there was one fellow that had -- had -- I think he had his appendix out.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And -- and they -- they get morphine, you know, every four hours if they need it.</sentence><sentence id="1457">So I prepared, up at my <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- we kept the -- the morphine and those drugs, you know, they didn't have them down there.</sentence><sentence id="1458">So I went down with my syringe and -- course Hans, as I remember, had called me and said he was in terrible pain.</sentence><sentence id="1459">So I went down and the poor fellow, when he saw me, the sweat started coming and he was in awful pain.</sentence><sentence id="1460">He -- and he's inching away back toward the <span
