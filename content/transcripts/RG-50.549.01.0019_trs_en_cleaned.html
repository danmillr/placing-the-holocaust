id="2">Lucine Horn: My name is Lucine Horn and my real name is Estelle Rubenlee.</sentence><sentence id="3">My maiden name.</sentence><sentence id="4">I am from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and presently I reside in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> since 1950.</sentence><sentence id="5">And this interview is being taken at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at 4850 Westland in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lincolnwood</span>, <span class="REGION">Illinois</span>.</sentence><sentence id="6">I offered to do this interview to tie in my video interview which I took for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> which involved my whole story of the war, Holocaust up until to the days of liberation.</sentence><sentence id="7">This will be just a follow up to what, what happened since 1945 January when I was liberated by the Russians in a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, to which I was taken with my husband after the Warsaw uprising, not the Ghetto uprising.</sentence><sentence id="8">The Polish uprising which took place in 1944, in October and as Poles there was no Jews at that time anymore.</sentence><sentence id="9">We were taken to <span class="REGION">southwest Poland</span> and dispersed to live with farmers.</sentence><sentence id="10">We were treated as refugees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and we also were fighting for the Polish underground.</sentence><sentence id="11">As such the German government placed us with farmers and the farmers had to support all the people that they evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> was</sentence><sentence id="14">Interview with Lucine Horn 2 evacuated because the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">The Russians were coming in from the East.</sentence><sentence id="16">The Germans were on the other part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and they needed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> to be evacuated so that there was the <span class="DLF">frontier line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">We were taken to this very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and placed by these farmers who had no idea about our origins and we had to pretend constantly that we are not Jews.</sentence><sentence id="18">That was, that went on from October 1944 until January 1945.</sentence><sentence id="19">1 don't remember the date but that was the time when we were liberated by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="20">The Russians came all the way through to <span class="REGION">southwest Poland</span> and the Germans were just rapidly running away.</sentence><sentence id="21">The Russians liberated us and came into this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="22">We still could not show the enthusiasm of being liberated and show any love for the Russians which we did have at that time and still do because they did liberate us from Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="23">But the Poles were not very happy about the Russians coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">And they didn't want the Russians to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> to begin with and that's why they staged this horrible uprising in 1944 in September when 350,000 Poles were killed, was killed and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was practically 40% in ruins and destroyed.</sentence><sentence id="25">So we still had to pretend.</sentence><sentence id="26">Even so we were very happy to see them.</sentence><sentence id="27">And we stayed around about a week until we got our thoughts together of what we going to do now and how to proceed.</sentence><sentence id="28">We did want to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> but it was quite far and of course the war was just happening, the war between the Germans and the Russians and there was no communications like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">Only that everything was in great chaos.</sentence><sentence id="30">But we said goodbye to the people to the farmers that we lived with and told them that we want to go back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">And we thought, they thought that we were from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="32">So it took us maybe about ten days or two weeks to make it.</sentence><sentence id="33">Wasn't such a long stretch but we were doing it mostly by the foot and maybe we found a peasant that had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and he took us a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="34">And we were trying to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">On the way we passed several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, small and big and we saw Jews come out from hiding so we</sentence><sentence id="37">Interview with Lucine Horn 3 kind of felt warm towards those people because they also survived.</sentence><sentence id="38">It was a good sign that there was more survivors.</sentence><sentence id="39">Until we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> to look for mostly to look for family and friends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="84">Q: If I could just ask you, you were saying as you were making your way to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> you would see Jews coming out of hiding and you know after all you had gone through in all those years of the war, I'm wondering if you could describe a little more, do you remember how, you know how you and your husband would react when you would see that.</sentence><sentence id="85">And how you would feel <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">And would you have encounters with these people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="90">A: Yes, it was a very chilling experience.</sentence><sentence id="91">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were mostly desolate.</sentence><sentence id="92">And there weren't too many people walking around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because the Germans had just passed through.</sentence><sentence id="93">We would come to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where maybe there was a square.</sentence><sentence id="94">And on the square people would congregate.</sentence><sentence id="95">And somehow, we always felt who it was Jewish or not.</sentence><sentence id="96">These people were completely different.</sentence><sentence id="97">I mean living in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and knowing the Polish people, we knew how the Polish people behave and how they look.</sentence><sentence id="98">These Jewish people were like they are coming out from hiding.</sentence><sentence id="99">Their heads were down.</sentence><sentence id="100">They were sad.</sentence><sentence id="101">They still had the frightened look in their eyes.</sentence><sentence id="102">They were probably hiding someplace.</sentence><sentence id="103">Whether in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> or being hidden in some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> you know.</sentence><sentence id="104">They did not appear like the other people do.</sentence><sentence id="105">And we kind of looked the same way I guess.</sentence><sentence id="106">And commonly we just like you know like dog to dog.</sentence><sentence id="107">We had something that pulled us to each other and we started to talk and it's the word to approach somebody was Am Who.</sentence><sentence id="108">Am Who means in Hebrew Am is Nation and Who meant are you from the same.</sentence><sentence id="109">And somehow we saw these people.</sentence><sentence id="110">We saw quite a few of those people.</sentence><sentence id="111">And</sentence><sentence id="113">Interview with Lucine Horn 4 we just rejoiced in seeing each other, but there was the sadness of having lost everything.</sentence><sentence id="114">So that was more or less what happened but we didn't stay on.</sentence><sentence id="115">We just kept on going.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: So you didn't talk to them very</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Well we just briefly talked to them but everybody was just engaged in searching and doing his thing and we couldn't wait to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">We had a knapsack and we were tired from walking and not sleeping and, and you know took us maybe ten days or two weeks to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">Once we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> there was a Jewish organization and they were registering all the people that were coming back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">A lot of it was a great influx of people from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">And <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> allowed these people to come back.</sentence><sentence id="150">And there were some people coming out from, very few from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">The majority from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and also some that were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for work.</sentence><sentence id="152">Like the able bodied, not Jewish looking, females mostly.</sentence><sentence id="153">Because males could always be checked out for being Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="154">Because of circumcision.</sentence><sentence id="155">So we met quite a few people, acquaintances and when we went to register ourselves at this Jewish committee, we found that nobody that from our families had been registered so we kind of already thought that there's nobody there from the family.</sentence><sentence id="156">But nevertheless we tried to establish ourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span> because we just didn't' know what to do with each other.</sentence><sentence id="157">And people were constantly coming.</sentence><sentence id="158">It was like every day when we went out to a town square you could see a few people coming here and there.</sentence><sentence id="159">And of course being a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, maybe somebody that you knew.</sentence><sentence id="160">So some friends and acquaintances came.</sentence><sentence id="161">And some were in more need than others.</sentence><sentence id="162">Some were fighting with, on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and were wounded.</sentence><sentence id="163">Some were in very bad shape physically so we tried to help each other.</sentence><sentence id="164">Also none of us had anything.</sentence><sentence id="165">And my husband met some family, he met</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="246">Interview with Lucine Horn 6 tried to get some things together and we knew that we have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and nobody knows us.</sentence><sentence id="247">And I have to buy some false papers and we have to just go out.</sentence><sentence id="248">So I went to her like in an afternoon and this woman knew me since practically I was 4 years old.</sentence><sentence id="249">And when she came in she says oh my god where are your parents and she started to cry.</sentence><sentence id="250">Where is your brother and she was crying and crying.</sentence><sentence id="251">And then I said to her, can I get the things that my mother left with you.</sentence><sentence id="252">And she said oh it's all in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>.</sentence><sentence id="253">If you come back at 2:00 P'll have everything ready.</sentence><sentence id="254">Well needless to say I came back at 2:00 and the Gestapo was there waiting for me.</sentence><sentence id="255">Her cousin was working for the Gestapo, he was a secret agent.</sentence><sentence id="256">And I had a terrible, I don't want to get into it now but I had a terrible encounter with these people.</sentence><sentence id="257">And practically cost my life.</sentence><sentence id="258">Somehow, I got out of it.</sentence><sentence id="259">And after the war I just couldn't forget it.</sentence><sentence id="260">So when I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.248" long="22.57">Lublin</span>, there was you know a committee of crimes and, you could really talk about these things.</sentence><sentence id="261">Especially show people that were hostile in doing these things.</sentence><sentence id="262">And I went to, over there to first of all I showed my face to her.</sentence><sentence id="263">And when she saw me that I survived, I knew this woman practically almost dropped in what she saw.</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="445">Definitely.</sentence><sentence id="446">The power of survival even for people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> which I never was and even people that saw their dearest slaughtered, there is a certain think in the human nature that really wanted to survive.</sentence><sentence id="447">And you know and I cannot talk about it to other people, but this is what we felt.</sentence><sentence id="448">| And I knew that I have to help my husband and I gotajob.</sentence><sentence id="449">We gota little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I got a

gets all his papers that he finished 3 years <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span>, maybe wherever we go, to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, he's got at least something to

where to go.</sentence><sentence id="462">It was very hard at the time, you know to make any, any sense was, with your plans.</sentence><sentence id="463">But then we joined a Zionist group which was a student group.</sentence><sentence id="464">There was about 25 Jewish students, Zionist oriented and we thought that maybe if we go with a group it would be easier for us to be recognized wherever we go.</sentence><sentence id="465">Rather than one individual person.</sentence><sentence id="466">So with a knapsack, the BreiHa was helping Israelis, were helping the Jews out of <span

us not to go any further because they said that they would like to help the students.</sentence><sentence id="478">And they might have a way for the Austrians to allow these peoples to

at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="503">And we were all supported by the Americans through the Austrians that had to do it.</sentence><sentence id="506">Interview with Lucine Horn 12 And we were a great group of people.</sentence><sentence id="507">And we spent 4 years there.</sentence><sentence id="508">It was kind of very, very

already.</sentence><sentence id="1880">And I kind of knew that you know having a baby is happiness and, and it's going to work.</sentence><sentence id="1881">It just absolute first.</sentence><sentence id="1882">There were things like being hand me downs you know.</sentence><sentence id="1883">There were people that were calling this lady that was teaching my husband.</sentence><sentence id="1884">And asking if the Horns need anything.</sentence><sentence id="1885">Can we send some linen to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or can we send some other things or do they need blankets.</sentence><sentence id="1886">These people just really because of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they wanted really to be helpful to us.</sentence><sentence id="1887">And they were.</sentence><sentence id="1888">So that's how life was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span>, New York.</sentence><sentence id="1889">And then my husband finished his internship and there was a big dilemma, what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1890">Because he still couldn't' get a permit to stay in <span class="REGION">New York state</span> and get a license and he really wanted to get a license in <span class="REGION">New York state</span> because he already had a lot of doctors that wanted him to work with them.</sentence><sentence id="1891">And we already knew a lot of people there.</sentence><sentence id="1892">And he did want to get licensed from <span class="REGION">New York State</span> and they were making all kinds of trouble for him.</sentence><sentence id="1893">At that time there was a law that whoever finished medicine after the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, cannot be allowed to, to take the boards.</sentence><sentence id="1894">There was all kinds of changes and all kinds of politics going on.</sentence><sentence id="1895">And the outcome of it was that he just couldn't get a license to practice right away.</sentence><sentence id="1896">So we decided that he will maybe become a house physician for a while because we needed some money desperately.</sentence><sentence id="1897">And maybe he work on a salary to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1898">And we didn't want to do it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> because we found some very dear friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo New York</span> which was about only 70 miles away.</sentence><sentence id="1899">And that was a little bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1902">Interview with Lucine Horn 35 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> had a million

<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to be with these friends that we knew from way back.</sentence><sentence id="1907">And unfortunately were there for 7 years.</sentence><sentence id="1908">We just couldn't' get out.</sentence><sentence id="1909">He was working and making some money.</sentence><sentence id="1910">And we bought a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, because he always wanted a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> on payment.</sentence><sentence id="1911">And I never could go back to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> because I had the little
