(</sentence><sentence id="281">Laughter) I...I stole some olives from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, but there was to steal.</sentence><sentence id="282">It was edible and to stay

only.</sentence><sentence id="288">Well, there was only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going to the <span class="DLF">French border</span> because the war broke out quite a few weeks after that.</sentence><sentence id="289">We had to get that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they gave us a train ticket so we went for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="290">Now what that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> looked like you will never know.</sentence><sentence id="291">They were hanging out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">They were laying on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span>...<span class="NPIP">inside</span>...<span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="293">It was unbelievable.</sentence><sentence id="294">They...they...they held children out out the <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="295">There was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for them.</sentence><sentence id="296">They were suffocating <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="297">There must have been a thousand people or maybe fifteen hundred people on a on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that is good for three hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="298">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> took off.</sentence><sentence id="299">It couldn't go very fast because people were on the <span class="DLF">roofs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="300">They were hanging out <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301"><span class="NPIP">Outside</span>...inside and they were hanging on their fingernails.</sentence><sentence id="302">People fell off, actually fell off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> while the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving so the train conductor didn't go to fast because he saw what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="303">By the time we got to the Italian/<span class="DLF">French border</span>, it was too late.</sentence><sentence id="304">The French had closed the <span class="DLF">border</span> and there's a little piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> called no man's land and the Italians wouldn't let us back.</sentence><sentence id="305">And that was the end of that.</sentence><sentence id="306">So we laid on that little piece land...there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">fishing village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="307">.St.</sentence><sentence id="308">Reno__...it's right on the <span class="DLF">border</span>. .</sentence><sentence id="309">It's right on the <span class="DLF">border</span>, and these old fishermen with these old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>...they saw a way to make money.</sentence><sentence id="310">Now these were impoverished people that never had anything except to catch a few fish now and then.</sentence><sentence id="311">So they said to us, we'll take you around the bent...it's a big rock...and you had to go around the bent onto the beaches of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> if you give us everything you have and uh pay us whatever you can pay, and we'll load up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="312">We'll take you.</sentence><sentence id="313">But what they didn't tell people, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> were old and that the breakers in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> were very strong onto the onto the uh __, unto the stone, unto the uh onto the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="314">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> came back out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">The waves were high and very strong and very uh uh dangerous.</sentence><sentence id="316">So as greedy as they were, they overloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="317">Some people had a wedding band, an engagement ring, maybe a few francs, maybe a few lire, maybe a little piece of jewelry that they saved, that they smuggled out.</sentence><sentence id="318">They overloaded.</sentence><sentence id="319">They gave them everything they owned.</sentence><sentence id="320">They overloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="321">They went out a little bit, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> broke in two.</sentence><sentence id="322">They capsized.</sentence><sentence id="323">They broke in two.</sentence><sentence id="324">The fishermen swam back.</sentence><sentence id="325">He has been fishing...he has been swimming since he was two years old, so there were people that couldn't swim.</sentence><sentence id="326">Now you tell me...who do you save when you're a father and and your little girl says Daddy, save me, and your little boy says Papa, save me.</sentence><sentence id="327">And your wife is drowning.</sentence><sentence id="328">Who do you save...and you can't swim, and the waves are high.</sentence><sentence id="329">The next day the the bodies came washing ashore.</sentence><sentence id="330">And there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> out there, two uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gun boats</span>.</sentence><sentence id="331">A French one and an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Italian gunboat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="332">And the the personnel on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span>, they were looking out and they saw the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="333">Nobody lifted their finger to help.</sentence><sentence id="334">The screams of help, please help, help my children, help my wife, uh save us...still ring into my ears to this day.</sentence><sentence id="335">Nobody cared.</sentence><sentence id="336">I met somebody there that knew my family and they said to me, you know about your brother Paul.</sentence><sentence id="337">I says what.</sentence><sentence id="338">He got out.</sentence><sentence id="339">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="340">The word got out.</sentence><sentence id="341">He was married.</sentence><sentence id="342">He had a twenty year old wife and he had a one year old baby.</sentence><sentence id="343">I said you know what happened to Judy (ph).</sentence><sentence id="344">Have you heard and had any word.</sentence><sentence id="345">He says yes.</sentence><sentence id="346">He tried to smuggle them out into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="347">He paid smugglers to bring them out.</sentence><sentence id="348">The smugglers took all their...what they owned in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and abandoned them.</sentence><sentence id="349">The baby started to cry.</sentence><sentence id="350">The Germans got them and hang them.</sentence><sentence id="351">They hang _ fromthe _ wife and baby next to her.</sentence><sentence id="352">They were found like that.</sentence><sentence id="353">I said anything you know about my brother Paul.</sentence><sentence id="354">He says yes.</sentence><sentence id="355">He went half crazy.</sentence><sentence

without having to worry or if you get a piece of bread without having to sleep with your with your stomach empty.</sentence><sentence id="1230">That was a big thing.</sentence></p><p><sentence

month we be...we just didn't any more uh uh mentally uh whether it was day or whether it was night or what.</sentence><sentence id="1292">It was dark in there with a little tiny <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort</span> , and maybe this will go on to the outside world to let people know what's going on here, make people find us, make people investigate.</sentence><sentence

pulled them back and they were shooting at us and yet still they pulled them in, in spite of the bullets.</sentence><sentence id="2575">You did so many things...there was so much going on with so little we we could do about these situations, but yet every little thing was a heroic act.</sentence><sentence id="2576">Can you understand that?</sentence><sentence id="2577">Everything was a heroic act and and and finally we got out and we said well...Max came to me and says I told you you'll make it, because many days we stood on the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> and says Max, we'll never get out of here.</sentence><sentence id="2578">Max was ten years older.</sentence><sentence id="2579">Max, we'll never make it.</sentence><sentence id="2580">It's already two

him...thought he was lying and I knew he was lying...but he said it anyway and and I could make myself believe it.</sentence><sentence id="2586">These are the little things that kept us going, little things, little supports, supporting each other.</sentence><sentence id="2587">Can you understand that?</sentence><sentence id="2588">We had so little to support ourselves with and so little hope.</sentence><sentence id="2589">How I survived I never know.</sentence><sentence id="2590">I tell you to this day it's a miracle how I got out of it, how I survived all these nonsense, all these
