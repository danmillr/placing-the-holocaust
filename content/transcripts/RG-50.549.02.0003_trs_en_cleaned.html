<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: Not to the same extent as some people believe in, particularly the people who founded and who promoted the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span>, because the horror of these</sentence><sentence id="1728">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0003 8 events is not a sufficient deterrent to prevent its repetition.</sentence><sentence id="1729">And moreover, concentration on the Holocaust alone doesn't give you a sufficient explanation of what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1730">You cannot understand the Holocaust if you only speak of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="1731">You have to see the whole system which ruled in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and which was one of the most barbaric systems in history.</sentence><sentence id="1732">Imagine what they did.</sentence><sentence id="1733">Not only did they kill people, murder people, but they took their teeth, their gold teeth or their hair.</sentence><sentence id="1734">Now, the most backward people considered it anathema to utilize parts of human bodies.</sentence><sentence id="1735">I mean, the -- the cannibals, that's a different -- the cannibals are something quite different.</sentence><sentence id="1736">The Germans, the Nazis were below cannibalism.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1737">Below cannibalism.</sentence><sentence id="1738">So did you bring us sandwiches, Liesel?
