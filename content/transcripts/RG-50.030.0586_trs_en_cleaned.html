<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="16">Q: And what was your name at birth?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="18">A: My name at birth was Ninetta.</sentence><sentence id="19">I was actually named after my grandmother, which was the tradition in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, to have the daughter of -- the first daughter to be named after the mother of the father.</sentence><sentence id="20">So my grandmother's name was Sarah, so I became Sarah, Serena, Nina, Ninetta.</sentence><sentence id="21">So I ended up with Ninetta.</sentence><sentence id="22">I had many first cousins with name was Nina, they also were named after my grandmother Sarah, but they used the Nina.</sentence><sentence id="23">I- It--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: Was her name Nina also?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="25">A: No, her -- my grandmother's name was Sarah, Sarah, but the -- the granddaughters were named either Nina or -- Nina, for the most part.</sentence><sentence id="26">I was an exception.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="29">Q: You were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ninetta</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="31">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ninetta</span>.</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="35">Interview with Ninetta Feldman , September 14, 2010</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="36">Q: And your last name?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="37">A: My n- my last name, maiden name is Matza.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="39">Q: Now, th -- when it's a male, it's Matsas, is that correct?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Matsas, right.</sentence><sentence id="42">And if it's a female is Matza, which really means you are the daughter of Matsas.</sentence><sentence id="43">In -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>, you're either the daughter of someone, or the wife of someone.</sentence><sentence id="44">So it's the -- you -- you decline the -- the -- the name, Matsas, of Matza -- of Matsas, which becomes Matsas, the generative -- you decline the name.</sentence><sentence id="45">And so my name, maiden name is Matza, not Matsas.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="52">Now, wh-wh-when one is named after the -- your grandmother --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="53">A: Pm sorry?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="54">Q: Sarah -- when you were named after your grandmother --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="55">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="56">Q: -- was she still alive?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="58">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: So this is different than in the Ashkenazi tradition isn't it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="62">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="64">Q: That you can be named in the Sephardic tradition with someone who's alive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="66">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="67">I think the Greek Jews adopted this tradition from the Christians because the Christian Greeks also name their children after the grandparents, regardless whether they're living or not, and so the first son is named after the father of the father, after the</sentence><sentence id="69">grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="70">The father of the father.</sentence><sentence id="71">The second son will be named after the father of the mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: Oh, I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="84">A: The -- if there's a daughter, the first daughter will be named after the mother of the father, and the second daughter after the mother of the -- the f-- the mother, after the mother of the mother.</sentence><sentence id="85">So it creates a lot of confusion, because there are so many people with the same first name and surname.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Right, right.</sentence><sentence id="92">And what -- when were you born?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="95">A: I was born March 21deg, 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="97">Q: Right, so you were a very young child at the time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="99">A: Very young, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: Now was -- y-you have a brother, Michael.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="103">A: Yes, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="105">Q: Was he named after --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: After my grandfather Nahoum.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Now, to have a name like Nahoum in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> does not make a child very comfortable, because it's very unusual.</sentence><sentence id="112">So he was -- he grew up known by that -- his nickname, Mykas(ph), his friends called him Mykas(ph), but his official name is Nahoum.</sentence><sentence id="113">And</sentence><sentence id="115">then when he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, he changed his name further, from -- Mykas(ph) became Michael.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="124">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="126">A: But his birth name is Nahoum, after my grandfather.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: And his -- and his middle name now, is Nahoum.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: Right, right, he retained the name, but became his middle name, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: Now, since you were so young at the time, do you think you can distinguish between what your earliest memories are, and what you were told happened, or is that difficult?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: That's a very, very good question, I often sort of struggle with it, trying to determine whether my recollection is a firsthand experience, or it's a reconstruction of what I heard from -- so many times from my parents and my brother.</sentence><sentence id="135">There are certain scenes that I know for sure; I'm talking about the earliest recollections, when I was perhaps three years old.</sentence><sentence id="136">There's certain scenes that I--I know, I remember very vividly.</sentence><sentence id="137">And I know these are firsthand recollections.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="142">Q: So perhaps when we speak, you can make a distinction between what you know, or your f--</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="144">Q: -- your own memories, and what you're not sure about --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="146">Q: -- and what you were told.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: Do you remember moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>, or -- or you don't remember that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: The actual move, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transportation</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="183">Q: Right, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>

night, was a very frightful night, because we didn't know whether the Germans were advancing during the night, but there was a big explosion, a distant explosion.</sentence><sentence id="1258">We didn't know where it was coming from.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I should say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans, there was there -- the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">EPON</span> was calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied men to take their weapons, rifles, whatever they had, and go to

I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that much later, but it impressed me that these -- what kind of mules are these?</sentence><sentence id="1263">These are just a -- they look like big -- big dogs; they were very small.</sentence><sentence id="1264">And of course, we were very grateful that there was a means of transportation, so we loaded a few -- a few things and along with the other Jewish men, we started climbing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1265">Now, this <span class="NPIP">part</span> I know is firsthand experience.</sentence><sentence id="1266">I remember my mother saying -- I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep walking, keep walking, you have to -- because I was behind everybody.</sentence><sentence id="1267">And I don't know whether she said the Germans are coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster.</sentence><sentence id="1268">And so it -- it was a -- it was a rainy day, and I remember my mother insisted that we all wear extra clothing for warmth, and finally we reached a <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, this mule driver took us to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a man called Chiandafelis(ph).</sentence><sentence id="1269">It was a -- th-there were no other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> there, just his <span

were there.</sentence><sentence id="1272">So they probably -- he probably told them that we are Jewish, and that the Germans were advancing.</sentence><sentence id="1273">I -- I don't know exactly what he told him.</sentence><sentence id="1274">But when the man, Mr.Chiandafelis(ph) heard the word Agrinion, he became very excited, because he told us that his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working

my</sentence><sentence id="1277">father's in the National Bank of Greece.</sentence><sentence id="1278">So he became very excited, because my father told him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> several times, and I know her, she is a very nice girl.</sentence><sentence id="1279">And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the <span

father</sentence><sentence id="1644">found a little <span class="DLF">ledge</span> on the side, sort of halfway into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1645">It was like an <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span>, and we spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1646">And -- and my

that he was going to be embarrassed.</sentence><sentence id="1882">And so he returned a few items.</sentence><sentence id="1883">But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was hidden

this man because he -- he really -- he created the situation that we -- we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter.</sentence><sentence id="1889">So they considered bringing this matter to the <span class="BUILDING">people's court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1890">There were <span class="BUILDING">people's courts</span> then, in <span

class="BUILDING">people's court</span> was actually very severe in punishments that -- that they imposed on people.</sentence><sentence id="1893">So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who knows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they decided to drop the matter.</sentence><sentence id="1894">And that they also didn't want to draw attention to ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1895">So they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and we went to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to live in.</sentence><sentence id="1896">This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time.</sentence><sentence id="1897">This one had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span>, one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kafeneio</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1898">And the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we occupied, and th -- and it had a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1899">And so -- so that was a big change, it was -- we adjusted to it very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="1900">But the main concern now was food.</sentence><sentence id="1901">There was a family by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, but had come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for the summer, and they stayed on because of the -- the war situation.</sentence><sentence id="1902">But they had decided to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1903">And they had a lot of wheat with them.</sentence><sentence id="1904">So my father, being a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span></sentence><sentence id="1906">Interview with Ninetta Feldman 4 September 14, 2010 employee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat.</sentence><sentence id="1907">He told him, if you give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1908">It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span>, but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a certain amount of wheat.</sentence><sentence id="1909">But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy, who could have cooperated at this point and -- and he could have made the Yovanos(ph) wheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for -- for himself.</sentence><sentence id="1910">And that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when -- after the war, the man recognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my parents and -- and asked them for their forgiveness, because by -- by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family.</sentence><sentence id="1911">So -- so th-that is the situation now, we are -- we have very little food.</sentence><sentence id="1912">We do have this oil that the villager brings from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and this wheat.</sentence><sentence id="1913">Then my mother started exchanging sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas.</sentence><sentence id="1914">It's a--a coarsely ground wheat mixed with milk that is -- that -- that is in a dry state and when you add some milk, it expands, and it's a very nutritious food and very filling.</sentence><sentence id="1915">So -- so this is what my mother started doing, exchanging sugar for -- for Trachanas or corn meal.</sentence><sentence id="1916">Then some of the villagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese.</sentence><sentence id="1917">It was a very difficult situation and there's winter approaching, it's already winter.</sentence><sentence id="1918">It is cold.</sentence><sentence id="1919">And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that --</sentence><sentence id="1921">that she is going to barter clothing, our personal clothes, for food.</sentence><sentence id="1922">And so she became a peddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, exchanging clothing for food.</sentence><sentence id="1923">Or, she did other things.</sentence><sentence id="1924">She knitted for people.</sentence><sentence id="1925">She was -- she had many skills.</sentence><sentence id="1926">She knew how to make lace.</sentence><sentence id="1927">An-And one -- one thought came to her mind is that the girls in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to --to knit.</sentence><sentence id="1928">I di-- can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so -- and said, there are a lot of girls in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who would want this, and they would exchange my services for food.</sentence><sentence id="1929">And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they had seven daughters.</sentence><sentence id="1930">They had prepare seven dowries.</sentence><sentence id="1931">So she went to -- started with them.</sentence><sentence id="1932">And she'd go there every day and help them, show them how to embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they had.</sentence><sentence id="1933">So they ha -- my parents had to start rationing the food.</sentence><sentence id="1934">It was less and less every day.</sentence><sentence id="1935">And I --- I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mulberry trees</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fig trees</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1936">There are a lot of mulberry trees and fig trees in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1937">And my mother said, you know, when these, you know, these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fig trees</span>, when spring and summer come, th-they'll be full of figs.</sentence><sentence id="1938">And so I remember this game very vividly, you know, walking underneath those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, waiting for someday to

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2013">A: That yes, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2014">In fact, at one <span class="NPIP">point</span>, it was in the summer when figs had formed, there was one fig tree that was growing on -- on the edge of a <span class="DLF">retaining wall</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="2016">I reached to -- to get a fig, and I fell off the <span class="DLF">retaining wall</span>, and I -- I remember that, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2017">I didn't get hurt, but --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2018">Q: Must have been a little scary.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2019">A: It was, it was.</sentence><sentence id="2020">It was scary, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2021">But --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2022">Q: Do you remember being hungry?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2023">A: Yes, [remember being hungry, and to this day, I cannot bear seeing people throw away food.</sentence><sentence id="2024">You know for me food is something very, very valuable, and I'm very conscious -- I'm very conscious of the waste that I see around me these days.</sentence><sentence id="2025">But yes, hunger was pervasive.</sentence><sentence id="2026">That's all we could think of was in our em -- our stomachs were empty, was -- it was -- we were very hungry.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2031">Q: Now, were people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> also hungry, or they were less so than you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2033">A: The villagers -- well, you know, they -- they had chickens, so they could get eggs.</sentence><sentence id="2034">They would slaughter a chicken here and there to get meat.</sentence><sentence id="2035">They had goats for milk.</sentence><sentence id="2036">But we had -- didn't have any of these animals, and they had stored food, as they always do, for the winter, like dry figs and walnuts, especially.</sentence><sentence id="2037">Lentils and beans, dry beans.</sentence><sentence id="2038">So poverty and hunger were pervasive, but we were -- we were worse off than they were, because we didn't have these resources that they were used to; the animals that provided them with nutritious food.</sentence></p></dialogue>

walked a long distance to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tatarna</span> that had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the partisans, and there was a doctor there.</sentence><sentence id="2154">They consulted with him, and the doctor gave them some medicine</sentence><sentence id="2156">for my father, but somehow the villagers and us had managed to recover whatever ailments we had, on our own.</sentence><sentence id="2157">So that was the situation in the winter.</sentence><sentence id="2158">It was a very desperate situation.</sentence><sentence id="2159">Then when spring came, there were -- things were a little better because they gave us a short -- a small plot to cultivate.</sentence><sentence id="2160">And then there were mulberries.</sentence><sentence id="2161">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mulberry trees</span> plentiful, which caused -- and we lived on mulberry berries for a number of days until we developed stomach cramps and we realized we had to stop that.</sentence><sentence id="2162">But it was a very difficult period, and my mother, she bore the brunt of it, she really did.</sentence><sentence id="2163">That is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and bring a horse-load of food.</sentence><sentence id="2164">And -- and there were groups of villagers that were going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2165">And she said, I'Il just join one of them and go down into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2166">And my father and brother always say no, no, absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="2167">And she would say why?The villagers go.</sentence><sentence id="2168">And -- and she -- they would say, yeah, but you're not an ordinary villager, you -- you're Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2169">And she said, well, I have an I.D. card, because they -- my parents had acquired I.D. cards issued by -- by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2170">The priests of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> provided them with baptismal papers and so the papers were given to the German authorities.</sentence><sentence id="2171">The names had -- were changed.</sentence><sentence id="2172">And there was a picture and my -- both my parents had an I.D. card with their picture and signed by German officials.</sentence><sentence id="2173">But the -- the ironic thing is that in the I.D., they do not ask for religion.</sentence><sentence id="2174">It's rather bizarre.</sentence><sentence id="2175">Perhaps they didn't want to raise suspicions that -- because tha-that was one of the reasons why many Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> did not feel threatened, did not feel that they</sentence><sentence id="2177">should leave, they should go into hiding, because the Germans were careful not to raise suspicions of what was awaiting them.</sentence><sentence id="2178">And -- and in fact, the letters that we were receiving from my relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> were -- were, you know, why don't you come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>, we have plenty of food.</sentence><sentence id="2179">Why should you be starving up there?</sentence><sentence id="2180">And the same letter from Evianir(ph) Papadapoulos(ph), our -- my father's colleague, you know, come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, there is plenty of food.</sentence><sentence id="2181">And there were many cases of Jews who returned.</sentence><sentence id="2182">They had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and gone to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to hide.</sentence><sentence id="2183">And because nothing was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, they returned, and they were eventually arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2184">But my -- my father, my brother were -- an-and my mother were determined to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2185">So -- but she, every time she saw a group of villagers going down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>, she would say, all I have to do is just join them and -- and our situation will improve.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2228">A: She just was so desperate that she was going to defy any danger that she was going to face.</sentence><sentence id="2229">And eventually, in March, when the snow melted and the conditions for travel were a little better, she -- she joined one of these groups, and went down, started a long trek towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city of Agrinion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2230">She walked for 12 hours, and on homemade shoes because her -- she had a pair of shoes that was threadbare, and then the other pair were -- had high heels.</sentence><sentence id="2231">You can see how -- how unprepared we were for this kind of life, she brought shoes with high heels to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2232">And so she -- she went with -- with a group of villagers down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2233">This is very rough terrain, and all on foot.</sentence><sentence id="2234">She walked for 12 hours,</sentence><sentence id="2236">until she reached a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2237">I believe it was called Frangokisa(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2238">Frangokisa(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2239">And she had given -- there was a young man, boy, who -- to whom my mother had given a slice of bread.</sentence><sentence id="2240">She had -- she brought two slices of bread, one for herself -- well, for herself, both of them, but she was so tired, she asked him, would you let me ride the mule if I gave you a slice of bread?</sentence><sentence id="2241">And -- and he did.</sentence><sentence id="2242">And while they were doing this transaction, all of a sudden she hears her name, you know, Mrs. Matsas, Mrs. Matsas.</sentence><sentence id="2243">And that was -- it turned out it was a friend of ours that they knew from Arta, and her husband was the math teacher of my brother.</sentence><sentence id="2244">What a coincidence, in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2245">And her name was Zvolise(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2246">And she said, Mrs.Matsas, where are you going, why are you here, where you should be far away from here.</sentence><sentence id="2247">And went on to say, haven't you heard, haven't you heard what happened to your people?</sentence><sentence id="2248">And then she went on to say, you know, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> and Preveza and Toannina have all been arrested.</sentence><sentence id="2249">The Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> are now housed in the <span class="BUILDING">Papapetrou tobacco warehouses</span> and I don't know where they took the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2250">And this is the first time that my mother learns of the fate of our relatives.</sentence><sentence id="2251">It was a very -- a very painful, unbelievable news that she heard, it was -- she was totally devastated, crushed.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2290">A: That was a very affluent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and it had this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the partisans and then the villagers.</sentence><sentence id="2291">One of the -- the doctors there at one point was Thanos(ph) Papatheodoro(ph), a very fine man, whose family also lived in the vicinity.</sentence><sentence id="2292">And a -- it's just a si-- it was a-- quite a coincidence, my mother and brother met them, met the family and the doctor and there were three daughters, Hera, Ephemia(ph) and Irini(ph), or Nini(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2293">And the middle one, Ephemia(ph) became my best friend after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2294">We're friends to this day.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2295">And there were -- they were -- played a very important role in the family, in my development.</sentence><sentence id="2296">They were a very cultured family, and it was through them that I was exposed to classical music and paintings.</sentence><sentence id="2297">Her father was an amateur painter.</sentence><sentence id="2298">A very refined person.</sentence><sentence id="2299">And -- and this is the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my f-- my brother was asked by the doctor -- I don't know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro(ph) or Dr. Panopoulous(ph), the earlier doctor, asked my father to sing the ma -- I'm sorry, my brother Mykas(ph), he was known as Mykas(ph) partisan songs.</sentence><sentence id="2300">And my -- my f-- brother loved those partisan songs, they were in the <span class="DLF">air</span>, everywhere.</sentence><sentence id="2301">They were very idealistic, describing a wonderful society that is going to be built after the war, a society that was free of ignorance and poverty and injustice.</sentence><sentence id="2302">And all of these wonderful ideas appealed to him as</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2305">a young person.</sentence><sentence id="2306">And so he -- he learned all those wonderful songs.</sentence><sentence id="2307">He sings them to this day.</sentence><sentence id="2308">I--I learned a few of them, but he was the one who -- who sang them, and he had a beautiful voice, he still does.</sentence><sentence id="2309">So now I will come back to the -- to this encounter of my mother with Mrs. Volis(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2310">So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as possible.</sentence><sentence id="2311">She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis(ph), and he suggested that -- n-now my mother actually, even at this point, she said -- she insisted that she go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, in spite of all this.</sentence><sentence id="2312">She said, we're starving, we -- we have to get some food.</sentence><sentence id="2313">And so her husband recommended that she go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroula</span>, where he has a kombarro(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2314">Kombarro(ph) is a godfather.</sentence><sentence id="2315">And his name was Christos Zambarros(ph), and he -- he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you.</sentence><sentence id="2316">So my mother started walking alone with this horrible knowledge of -- of what had happened to our people, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroula</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2317">She recognizes the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where this man lived, knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> several time, they do not answer.</sentence><sentence id="2318">Eventually they open the <span class="DLF">door</span> very cautiously, they let her in very quickly, and she -- she told them who she was and who -- who sent her to them, and she said, I'm looking for Christos Zambarros(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2319">These were the sisters of Christos, and they said -- they were -- they were frightened because the Germans has searched their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> moments before my mother arrived.</sentence><sentence id="2320">They took her to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and they said -- pointed to the -- to the square and said, look down there.</sentence><sentence id="2321">You see, the Germans are still there and they're still searching for people there.</sentence><sentence id="2322">They were searching for partisans, because at this point the -- the resistance had grown very strong and they</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2326">were sabotaging the German advance and German actions; blowing <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and destroying <span class="DLF">roads</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2327">And so they said, take this ker -- they gave her a kerchief quickly, said put it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2328">Don't say anything.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2329">They sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha -- what happened, and begged him to -- to go -- I think -- I think what happened -- I don't know -- I'm not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their <span class="BUILDING">country home</span> where a deaf mute aunt was guarding their <span class="BUILDING">store</span> -- the food supplies.</sentence><sentence id="2330">I don't know where this meeting with Christos Zambarros(ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and understood the situation, and he said, don't worry.</sentence><sentence id="2331">I will go down to -- into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and I will do my best to bring a horse-load of -- of food.</sentence><sentence id="2332">So in the meantime, my mother was waiting in this <span class="BUILDING">country home</span> with this deaf mute aunt.</sentence><sentence id="2333">This -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroila</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2334">And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not allow any food to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2335">And they had -- they had executed resistance fighters already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, about 200 of them.</sentence><sentence id="2336">So the situation had really become very hard, very tough.</sentence><sentence id="2337">And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your neighbors, were tea, a bottle -- a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches.</sentence><sentence id="2338">Very useful things, but not what we expected.</sentence><sentence id="2339">So -- so my mother took this me -- these few items and started walking back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2340">And at one point she -- she met Pepola(ph) Hannah(ph).</sentence><sentence id="2341">He was a re -- a Jewish resistance fighter, and he already knew</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2345">what had happened.</sentence><sentence id="2346">So they fell into each other's arms and they cried and it was a very, very emotional experience for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="2347">But she had to rush -- I should tell you that there were a lot of Jewish young men that had joined the resistance up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2348">They have left their -- their families to -- to save themselves, and they joined the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="2349">Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the -- the andartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families, and so they returned.</sentence><sentence id="2350">But a number of them stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2351">So they had to rush to -- Christos(ph) and my mother -- th-the partisans did not allow anybody to walk after sundown, and it was close to sundown.</sentence><sentence id="2352">So they climbed a <span class="DLF">hill</span>, and at the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> was a little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span>, a little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that Christos" grandfather had built.</sentence><sentence id="2353">And so they spent the night there, and this was <span class="BUILDING">Saint Elias chapel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2354">And then the next day they said goodbye, and there is my mother bearing this horrible news, alone, walking alone from this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroiula</span>, all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span>, bearing the news alone, and crying all the time.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2355">So when she came back, at that point my brother, my f-- and my father were outdoors working on this plot of <span class="REGION">land</span> that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her coming, she was walking very slowly, they started to laugh, and they said, didn't we tell you not to go?</sentence><sentence id="2356">You came back -- she came back three days later and she -- she was planning to stay for seven or eight days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2357">We told you not to go.</sentence><sentence id="2358">And my mother was in terrible physical shape, bearing the horrible news and she said, don't laugh.</sentence><sentence id="2359">Come in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when I tell you what happened, you will cry with bitter</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2363">Interview with Ninetta Feldman u September 14, 2010 tears.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And so she told us, and we were -- we were just devastated.</sentence><sentence id="2365">And I remember this scene.</sentence><sentence id="2366">I had never, ever seen my mother in that state.</sentence><sentence id="2367">Her eyes were -- her -- her feet were swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and emotionally just absolutely drained.</sentence><sentence id="2368">So we were just -- just -- just shocked.</sentence><sentence id="2369">It took us -- took a long time for -- to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a ray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span>, that they were being relocated to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to establish their own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>, to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> wherever they wanted.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2370">So we thought that th -- these Jews as well, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span>, Arta and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span>, that that was their destination.</sentence><sentence id="2371">And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but -- but what can we do in -- we're in this remote <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, what can we do?</sentence><sentence id="2372">But my father knew that there was a contingent of the British mission in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, because the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the scenes.</sentence><sentence id="2373">Helping the resistance.</sentence><sentence id="2374">The British were there helping the resistance, even though later on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from becoming established in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2375">But we -- my father knew of this British mission, and he said we -- we -- we have to contact them.</sentence><sentence id="2376">We should write letters and we should send a letter to the -- he said, the nations of the world have to know what's happening, they have to do something to stop it.</sentence><sentence id="2377">We didn't really know what was -- you know, anything about</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2381">the Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point.</sentence><sentence id="2382">So -- so my father decided to write a letter addressed to the British government.</sentence><sentence id="2383">And the letter, that was going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>, and they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2384">It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something.</sentence><sentence id="2385">And so sure enough, my father composed these letters and -- and my mother and brother again, were to deliver these letters to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2386">They didn't know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> was, they had to -- to ask many people to find their way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2387">So they finally arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> and the -- the British officials are willing to meet with them.</sentence><sentence id="2388">And my mother, when she came back, she described that they -- they walked into a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, and they sat on two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span>, my brother and -- and her, and facing these British officers, and they told them what had happened, and they -- they begged them to deliver these letters.</sentence><sentence id="2389">And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn't sound very reassuring.</sentence><sentence id="2390">In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know -- and I don't know if it was his wife and children or -- or some other relative, they -- you know, my wife and children died in the bombing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, and -- and that -- I have to bear that loss.</sentence><sentence id="2391">So my mother was in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words.</sentence><sentence id="2392">And so they left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission.</sentence><sentence id="2393">I don't know whether these letters were ever de-delivered to -- to anybody.</sentence><sentence id="2394">But one -- one good thing that they discovered while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span>, there were a lot of parachute drops that they were -- th-they</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="2398">Interview with Ninetta Feldman &gt;&gt; September 14, 2010 were delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and -- and so the villagers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> had a lot of this material.</sentence><sentence id="2399">So much of it they didn't know what to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="2400">And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> asking for some of this parachute material, it's like a dark, khaki kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes.</sentence><sentence id="2401">And so when they returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after their mission, my brother came into the hou -- room with this big bundle of parachute material.</sentence><sentence id="2402">And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to sew dresses, blouses, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2403">But I -- from what I recall, we did not dwell on this.</sentence><sentence id="2404">Th- There weren't many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2405">And -- and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they were relocated to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and when the war is over, they will return.</sentence><sentence id="2406">We were -- my parents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late years, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be -- they" be able to survive.</sentence><sentence id="2407">So then -- so my mother started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses and resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2408">And that really was very, very helpful, because now it's summertime, the villagers have more food to exchange for -- for dresses,

Mykas(ph) decided to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, but my mother decided to stay, to guard whatever food we had.</sentence><sentence id="2916">So my mother and I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and we were joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she spoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that she protected the upper village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2917">I don't know, this is a story that I'm not very

is how we stand this time when the -- the Germans -- that was their second foray into our <span class="REGION">region</span>, but this time they never reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and -- and so -- and so we all returned.</sentence><sentence id="2927">So this is Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) who played a significant part in -- in our story.</sentence><sentence id="2928">As I said, th-the people really -- they tried to -- to help in any way they -- they could, including th-the priest.</sentence><sentence id="2929">You know, we -- we used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, first of all to -- not to show that we were any different than the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a -- a memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates, cinnamon and sugar.</sentence><sentence id="2930">It's a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we'd go there and -- and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and so there was another source of food for us.</sentence><sentence id="2931">And the priest, I don't

Easter</sentence><sentence id="2939">100 Interview with Ninetta Feldman September 14, 2010 services -- Friday, Good Friday services.</sentence><sentence id="2940">And this is the time when -- I learned later on, you know, after the war, I -- I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with my friends a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2941">And so as I said earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than -- than the Jewish religion.</sentence><sentence id="2942">But on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and -- and he's dead, and the priest is supposed to exhort his flock to -- to move them, that this wonderful human being sacrificed his -- his life t-to save you.</sentence><sentence id="2943">He's -- and so he would -- he -- he -- he would ha -- he had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had to go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross.</sentence><sentence id="2944">And so Sunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and apologized to my parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us.</sentence><sentence id="2945">So i-it was, of course, appreciated by my parents.</sentence><sentence id="2946">He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do?</sentence><sentence id="2947">I'm expected to do that, I'm expected to give this kind of sermon.</sentence><sentence id="2948">So now, go back to my brother and Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), they're returning to the <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3382">A: They always talked about our adventure in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span>, always.</sentence><sentence id="3383">And they didn't put

described.</sentence><sentence id="3409">And now in retrospect, when I think -- when I think of it, it's very, very painful.</sentence><sentence id="3410">Because I can --I can just picture now my
