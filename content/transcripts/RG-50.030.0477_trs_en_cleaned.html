<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="47">Q: Uh-huh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="51">A So -- but it was a little -- known for its <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing fleet</span>, in fact, and in the war, the name <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scheveningen</span> was the shibboleth term by the Germans and the Dutch, because the Germans couldn't pronounce the sra sound of the guttural ch of Dutch, and they said S- Shravening -- Shaveningen.</sentence><sentence id="52">So when the soldiers who were dressed in Dutch uniforms, German soldiers, the early stage of the war, were asked whether you're, you know, friend or foe, and say Scheveningen vischenschuit, they said Scheveningense vischenschuit and they were shot.</sentence><sentence id="53">So that's the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, anyway, it's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="60">Q: Sin -- since you were such a young person during this period, having been born in 1935, it would be good if we could try to distinguish between what you actually remember, when we talk about the experiences, and what you were -- what you were told, so we can get an idea what your memory is versus what you're remembering from other people's, if you think we can do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="74">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="76">A: [indecipherable], as -- what I've heard, which I have seen confirmed, in fact, what I have -- things have re -- recors -- subsequently confirmed in writing, so I guess I attributed it to my recall as well.</sentence><sentence id="77">And what I've read, and heard, and talked with my brother and sister, or others.</sentence><sentence id="78">But as I've mentioned to you, otherwise, my recall is spotty, and more in the sense of mental imprints, like [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="79">Some absolute I recall, I -- I fix in my mind to this day I could see certain pictures, and I don't have a running --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Ah, okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="141">A: Stamp collecting, or providing postage stamps to other stamp s -- th -- used to be many more small <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in Europe, to this day there are more than United States, who -- that specialized in particular items, so there -- now, also there are few <span class="BUILDING">postage stamp stores</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, most probably have s -- some Bethesda.</sentence><sentence id="142">But that was the job, to collect stamps from the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, and organize them by <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and know the dates, and the value, and they sell them to <span class="BUILDING">dealers</span>, or to customers.</sentence><sentence id="143">So, postage stamps.</sentence><sentence id="144">He had his own, apparently a very personal, good postage stamp collection as well, which he gave over to someone, acquaintance or a friend, we don't know exactly who, before the war.</sentence><sentence id="145">It never returned after the war.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: Whatever that meant, as a child, but oh -- but I-I see them around, I mean postage stamps were very popular, much more than today --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="168">Q: So you recall in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> seeing the postage stamps?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: -- was born in 20 si -- 1926, and Aron -- Erik, was born in 1924.</sentence><sentence id="195">So they were substantially older than I wa-was.</sentence><sentence id="196">As a child there's a big difference, obviously.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="236">Q: Do you remember your parents at tha -- i-i-in that period when you were [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="665">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="667">A: -- on to a different subject matter, after the war, people tried to find out what happened to their relatives.</sentence><sentence id="668">And in our case, we were more ot less told by relatives and others, that our parents were deported and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and that was the als -- we had no documentation for that.</sentence><sentence id="669">As a child I did not pursue it very much, but later on as an adult, I tried to pursue it, especially when I read about that the Red Cross had tracing of a sort.</sentence><sentence id="670">And the first few answers was -- is all we know is that they were deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we don't know when, where.</sentence><sentence id="671">Later on they gave us a date, but no formal document confirmation.</sentence><sentence id="672">In year 2001, I got a Red Cross notification with documentation.</sentence><sentence id="673">Now, it turns out that in the Dutch registry, in the -- the government has a regis -- gazettes of a sort, they had ready -- in 1951 printed names of the fate of various people, and they send us a copy of those 1951 items, but nobody who we addressed -- now, had we known that it was in the registry, I would have gone to the Dutch registry, but no one ever hinted that it is available.</sentence><sentence id="674">So the first time I actually had confirmation of my parents death and departure dates, which initially came really out, that was in year 2000.</sentence><sentence id="675">A long time.</sentence><sentence id="676">And in fact, the Yahrzeit celebration -- commemoration, not celebration, commemoration of deceased, was an unknown item for us, we had no idea which day to commemorate.</sentence><sentence id="677">So -- you may be aware that the rabbinate in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> selected one date of the year for those people that did not know when their immediate families were killed, or died.</sentence><sentence id="678">And they selected the 10" of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tevet</span>, but -- so we observe that day as our Yahrzeit day.</sentence><sentence id="679">So the f --</sentence><sentence id="681">4 took us till ni -- year 2000 to find a actual date, which turned out to be the 15" of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shavuot</span>, so --</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1278">A: Well, here again see, I in some sense was a beneficiary of being a young child.</sentence><sentence id="1279">I had no reason to parade in the large <span class="REGION">areas</span> like most norm [indecipherable] and I was in this Birnbaum family, in their -- and was probably nu -- wherever I slept in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, in the morning go to the <span class="BUILDING">Birnbaum's</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1280">So that was my routine, so no reason for me to wonder.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1284">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1286">A: So the restrictions that existed most probably did not impair me, because there was no need for me to wander around.</sentence><sentence id="1287">So that respect, being young was a blessing.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1304">A: My brother had more exposure, both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>, because as you move up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> of age, you get -- you're drawn into these other restrictions.</sentence><sentence id="1305">So I can't say that I felt, you know, restricted or inhibited, like most children in today's environment most probably wouldn't feel restricted if they cannot cross the <span class="DLF">street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1306">You know, if you ask them 20 years later, did you feel dil -- were you a prisoner of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1307">I don't think they would express it in these terms.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1454">A: Also in the same <span class="BUILDING">Hamborg caserne</span>, that's where the Dutch were.</sentence><sentence id="1455">And they were [indecipherable] pretty impressive stone structures.</sentence><sentence id="1456">And in that respect you look at it now, it looks like, you know with the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, with kind of tiered, round <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1457">But all of that was very crowded, and not very, you know attractive.</sentence><sentence id="1458">But people always say that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> is an attractive <span class="NPIP">place</span> compared with the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, and they're absolutely correct in that respect, but it's not a place recommend for a vacation.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1804">Q: -- it both -- it bothered you when you were -- didn't --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1806">A: -- but yes [indecipherable] consideration -- we -- many people who were in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, although the food was not prepared under kosher auspices, ate what they could eat, which was not -- definitively not kosher like.</sentence><sentence id="1807">Pig meat if they had given it, or horsemeat, or this sort.</sentence><sentence id="1808">So -- and all I could do then, eat the horsemeat.</sentence><sentence id="1809">I mean, the soup may have had horsemeat content in there, but it's -- now a lard was definitively food from -- not to be eaten, and this we knew, I was raised that way, so it became a issue.</sentence><sentence id="1810">That's why I had to - - we had to debate it, or discuss it.</sentence><sentence id="1811">And I remember that discussion [indecipherable] no, of what should we do, and then we consulted the local rabbi over there, and [indecipherable] rabbis there who gave me a ruling that it's permissible, and I should go, and it's in my interest to do so.</sentence><sentence id="1812">So I knew enough about that as well, my brothers knew more -- my brother knew more, my sister knew more.</sentence><sentence id="1813">So it became a legitimate discussion issue, but --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1822">Q: Maybe I didn't ask the question in a way that was understandable.</sentence><sentence id="1823">I meant when you actually ate there.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1826">A: Oh.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1828">Q: Did that bother you, or did you say since they said it was okay --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1830">A: After awhile -- no, after awhile -- but no, after awhile it was okay, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1832">Q: -- after it was okay -- it was okay.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1834">A: Yes, I don't think I had a great abhorrence.</sentence><sentence id="1835">And most probably kids don't really know what they're eating anyhow, once it's served.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1845">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1847">A: No, the issue was the underlying principle.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1849">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1851">A: You know, so no, that.</sentence><sentence id="1852">I'm sorry, that was your question.</sentence><sentence id="1853">I did not sense it was, you know, just didn't taste good, or th -- I didn't put up a battle subsequently of saying no, I don't, that's not for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1857">Q: No.</sentence><sentence id="1858">Did you know that people were being transported out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1861">A: Yeah, yeah, well see, because we were very close -- lived.</sentence><sentence id="1862">We were associated very close to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1863">Outside there was a big <span class="DLF">fence</span>, a <span class="DLF">metal fence</span>, and a major part of the day I spent around that <span class="DLF">fence</span> watching the activity of the <span class="BUILDING">train depot</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1864">A lot of them -- the arrivals I saw.</sentence><sentence id="1865">And when the arrivals came, there was a lot of discussion, because not only I, other people standing over there, where they from?</sentence><sentence id="1866">Cause sometimes they came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> close by.</sentence><sentence id="1867">Or from relatives they had, even if they're from a dif -- different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1868">So that people were identified, and the Czech group came in, so the people said, oh not for me, I don't know anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1869">Or the Danish came, late at the end of the thing, same story.</sentence><sentence id="1870">So -- but the time you -- first you saw the arrivals, so some you knew, so that this came a discussion point, and people tried to see whether they knew anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1871">And they came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, it was a big excitement, because suddenly people -- the adults met acquaintances, or even relatives, and I was part of the -- the watching scenery and taking it in, but not -- no -- I had met -- I never met -- met anybody who I knew, obviously, or anybody who was look -- looking for me.</sentence><sentence id="1872">Although subsequently I have to mention to you, some distant relatives of my mother did arrive, and later on we had contact with them.</sentence><sentence id="1873">So the [indecipherable] contact with us, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="1874">Did I know people were leaving?</sentence><sentence id="1875">I saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> too, but what it meant -- you see, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">two way traffic</span>, all right?</sentence><sentence id="1876">But the injection of new coming -- I did sense, of the people with whom I dealt with, that they weren't there any more after awhile.</sentence><sentence id="1877">So there was a [indecipherable] whether people made friendships or so, it's different -- different friendships with people are there for two months, or three months, and fending for themselves, and then they disappear.</sentence><sentence id="1878">You become acquaintance, and then you know somebody's name, and suddenly -- sit next to them in the study group, and he is no longer there.</sentence><sentence id="1879">I had that sense of coming, going, people moving in and moving out, but where they were going, I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="1880">Where they came from was the curiosity to be discovered.</sentence><sentence id="1881">And in <span class="DLF">line</span>-ups -- in the time of day we had <span class="DLF">line</span>-ups, the different groups lined up near the <span class="DLF">fences</span>, so that conversations started taking place, and you started picking up, you know, different languages.</sentence><sentence id="1882">Danish sing-song, and as a kid started making fun, or trying to imitate, and learning different phrases from people.</sentence><sentence id="1883">But I'd never picked up the language, okay?</sentence><sentence id="1884">But there as a lot of interact -- not lot, there was interaction, we had an hour, half hour, how long it took to wait, and we saw different nationalities, and different languages, and kind of came [indecipherable] curious what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="1885">So there was more -- I think the arrivals left a bigger impact on me than the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">departures</span>, because I had no idea where people are going.</sentence><sentence id="1886">I knew where they came from.</sentence><sentence id="1887">And you -- suddenly you sit next to the</sentence><sentence id="1889">4 Danes, and you sit next to the Hungarians when they came at the end.</sentence><sentence id="1890">But we were not allowed to mix, and we -- there really was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> between the nationalities, unless they put them in the same caserne.</sentence><sentence id="1891">So I became more aware of the change of population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> over time, but the immediate group of people whom -- who I deal with, my brother and my sister, Malka Weinmann and her husband, midway were shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, cause she was more Dutch, and he was more -- he was Czech originally.</sentence><sentence id="1892">So they categorized him, he came under her auspices, and she had other potential [indecipherable] I'm not clear why she survived, but she did.</sentence><sentence id="1893">Anyway, that part I -- that one part of the middle of our stay, he was shipped out in [indecipherable] and I do kind of have a image of her being sad for one period of there, but could have been anything, or so, but later on she told me it was -- what was happening.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3113">Q: What was it like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3115">A: First of all, they came and obviously jubilant, you know.</sentence><sentence id="3116">Was a -- and the people themselves were kind of very excited and they handed out ci-cigarettes to people, and chocolates to people, I think to us, to kids, and in that respect they were very, quote, kind, and a breath of fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="3117">Right?</sentence><sentence id="3118">Soldiers who were friendly rather than soldiers who were guarding people who -- and people embraced them, and touched them, it was a different - - you saw that some whatever it was, new -- liberators, but that's what -- that's what they left the impression.</sentence><sentence id="3119">In that respect they were most pr -- most probably very good.</sentence><sentence id="3120">I did know, and I can see that image too, of rampaging through the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to the caserne of the -- you know, where people were crowded, and ripping off watches of women.</sentence><sentence id="3121">I saw that scene, apparently they also pillaged and raped, which I obviously did not see -- or not obviously, but I just didn't see, or didn't know what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="3122">That's later, but the grabbing off watches of people who somehow managed to retain them during the war period is -- was very kind of shocking to me.</sentence><sentence id="3123">But they di -- transformed very quickly, the role of the being behind the <span class="DLF">fences</span> versus being free, and more movement.</sentence><sentence id="3124">I think the <span class="DLF">fence</span> came down, or -- but we still had a <span class="DLF">fence</span>, I remember was the -- suddenly you saw the German soldiers, whoever the -- whoever was in charge of the control mechanism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span> were now being required to go with wheelbarrows and picking things up, and fixing things up, and breaking things down, and they were being beaten by some former German people who ta -- trying to put -- change their roles in order to get more privileges, and that was going on and people were cheering on and pointing out, you know, hit them harder, etcetera, this sort, get even with them.</sentence><sentence id="3125">So the -- again, that was a very different atmosphere what you saw before.</sentence><sentence id="3126">So that's the Russians kind of influence, a very quick turnaround of the ones who were doing the Nazi work before, and now they became -- and we [indecipherable] was a little surprising to see these other naz -- Nazis, or Germans, and Germans beating up their compatriots, or so, and with full vigor, I mean, just reversed direction.</sentence><sentence id="3127">But that -- the transition from being occupied versus being liberated, and the change took [indecipherable] very, very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="3128">And very noticeable, and to -- very quick.</sentence><sentence id="3129">Now in May, the eighth, ninth, we were liberated, and by June already we were out.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3152">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3154">A: Now, a lot of people didn't make it to later.</sentence><sentence id="3155">There was a typhus epidemic, and again is a quarantine, but the most typhus epidemic took place in that other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span> where these other people who were in the death marches who made it, barely made it, ended up.</sentence><sentence id="3156">I don't know whether in our particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>, they did it by caserne to caserne, I don't know what -- we were allowed to leave in June.</sentence><sentence id="3157">Again, some people say you couldn't have left in June because there was a general quarantine.</sentence><sentence id="3158">Well, I know I left in June, you know, I mean --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3164">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3166">A: I don't care what the historian books say on that.</sentence><sentence id="3167">People verif -- generalize from the generic fact, and apply it to everybody.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3170">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="3171">So where did you all go?</sentence><sentence id="3172">And -- and who -- was it Leo who made the decision</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3176">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, what happened was after the war, there was a very st -- quick effort to identify, locate people who survived.</sentence><sentence id="3177">And whoever did this, might -- the Russians, or others, made a list of the survivors in tha -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, and people from different <span class="REGION">localities</span> contacted the authorities somewhere, that was designated, maybe Red Cross [indecipherable] I don't recall, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="3178">And we had relatives who survived the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, who were in hiding during the war, in the broadest [indecipherable] were kind of somewhat distant, but in the context of the time they very close to my family, partly they're -- they were raised in the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, very close in the same <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>, effectively, so they were like very close cousins, brother, sister type relationship.</sentence><sentence id="3179">Anyhow, that relative knew that, you know, who was -- who were the Dutch relatives they had, and went around finding out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> most probably, with the Dutch authorities, where are the S-Sigmann family, my parents, my brothers and my sister and myself.</sentence><sentence id="3180">And eventually they found out that the only ones who are surviving from their records was us three.</sentence><sentence id="3181">And they got in touch with the Theresienstadt people, who went and got in touch with Malka Weinmann, and through us, and saying, oh, yo- you will come back, you have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go -- the people who were released from these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had a -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go.</sentence><sentence id="3182">We had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go because somebody was claiming us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3190">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3192">A: Had we not had that we would have been again, rerouted somewhere to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span>, or hang around later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.511" long="14.151">Theresienstadt</span>, I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="3193">But since we had a relative who was putting a claim us and offered t-to come to them, we went with Malka Pollaczek, who also had a brother, and Alicia Farber, whose parents survived.</sentence><sentence id="3194">So she was reunited with her parents, so her parents were claiming her.</sentence><sentence id="3195">So we all went back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> to the <span class="REGION">American section</span>, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> kind of was split into different <span class="REGION">regions</span> whoever liberated them.</sentence><sentence id="3196">One half was the Russians, one half was the Americans or the French, I think.</sentence><sentence id="3197">And we</sentence><sentence id="3199">7 took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span>, and maybe took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, I think a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French plane</span>, was probably a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transport plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3200">And we stayed a few days or so with Malka Weinmann, because we were close to her.</sentence><sentence id="3201">And you ask what attachment, that was probably -- I -- we sensed that.</sentence><sentence id="3202">And well, a very different life suddenly, you know, plates, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span>, and food that we never had eaten before.</sentence><sentence id="3203">White bread was served, we thought it was cake, we refused to eat it as bread.</sentence><sentence id="3204">I had a tin can of anchovy paste, I don't know whether you know what anchovy paste is, it was in a tin -- a tin little thing like toothpaste, imported [indecipherable] foods never crossed my lips.</sentence><sentence id="3205">Spent a few days over there, till they discussed with -- how to get us to these relatives, the Bergers, who themselves spent the war years separated from their children, daughter and son.</sentence><sentence id="3206">The daughter, son and parents were in three different <span class="NPIP">locations</span>, and they were --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3224">Q: And they all survived?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3226">A: They survived, yes, they survived.</sentence><sentence id="3227">And then I rejoined living with them after, for one year or so, till other family members elsewhere in the world started looking for the Sigmann family, and locating us, and discovered we were the only survivors.</sentence><sentence id="3228">So we spent a year with the Bergers, and were a year in -- from June to July, or June of ni -- June to June, from "45 to "46, and being -- lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="3232">Q: And how was that for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="3234">A: Again, they were very caring, and very warm, and very attentive to us, but they themselves had to reconstruct their lives, because they had a major interruption in their life.</sentence><sentence id="3235">So we took in the scene of reconstituting life, but was really more normal from what people were used to.</sentence><sentence id="3236">I mean, s-sitting at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the family rather than in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3237">Cooking, baking, washing.</sentence><sentence id="3238">You know, th-this family, the Bergers, they were hidden by some nurses, single women who had worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> before, and | think they lived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3239">And they lived behind a <span class="DLF">partition wall</span> for several years.</sentence><sentence id="3240">Couldn't go out in daytime.</sentence><sentence id="3241">Didn't know where their daughter and son was -- were.</sentence><sentence id="3242">Their daughter was too old to be hidden, but too young to be hidden, too, so she had had a quote, an Aryan appearance, so she worked for somebody in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> as a open house help, au pair.</sentence><sentence id="3243">It's -- her name is Miriam.</sentence><sentence id="3244">And she was there, and -- very interesting story is that we -- we -- once we came back, and told us their -- their tale, and each one has his own tale of escape and saving.</sentence><sentence id="3245">But this girl, Miriam, mus-must have been around 16 maybe, by the end of the war, was in -- publicly hidden, and the people were very devout, Calvinist, or [indecipherable] most people did not e -- travel -- or com -- can't do anything on a Sunday.</sentence><sentence id="3246">That when they later on came to visit us, visit us on Saturday in fact, apologized that we came on the sebbe -- Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="3247">But they were very devout, they were very close to the family, but they were very good people, too.</sentence><sentence id="3248">They -- in order to -- they kept the fact that she was Jewish in hiding, or public hiding from their own children, so they couldn't say very much, but they read the scriptures, and how the very devout Christians, and they tried to read the Scriptures associated with the holidays, to keep this girl informed about purink and how do the calendar, or what have you, but sh -- Passover, and Easter, often overlap, so they read this -- the -- the portion she told us about, it was kind of -- and they're very nice people.</sentence><sentence id="3249">We met them after they came, they</sentence><sentence id="3251">8 were very close.</sentence><sentence id="3252">But kind of seeing how people were coming out of the war, and what they went through, was both interesting, and it was very common.</sentence><sentence id="3253">Their son, who was a tall fellow, was in hiding in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span>, in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> up in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, again didn't see daylight, public daylight for several years.</sentence><sentence id="3254">And he was an artist and he made wooden pins for the underground, emblems.</sentence><sentence id="3255">I believe that's how he spent his time.</sentence><sentence id="3256">And so the reconstituting of life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was -- we were part of it, but we [indecipherable] we were visiting.</sentence><sentence id="3257">These Bergers are interesting people because they used to have a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, a very elegant one apparently, before the war, and they had pretty elegant dishes, and cutlery, but after the war their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was gone, all their belongings were gone.</sentence><sentence id="3258">They couldn't -- they knew who they gave it, they couldn't get it back, even because they survived.</sentence><sentence id="3259">People denied, apparently that they had received anything.</sentence><sentence id="3260">They had to start from scratch, in very small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>, we lived in very, very small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3261">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3262">We had a little metal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> that we -- I was a little boy, I was able to use, other people used most probably too, and we went to <span class="INT_SPACE">public baths</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3263">This was the life.</sentence><sentence id="3264">But for them it was a -- happy to survive, but was a big setback of their lifestyle to what they had to live through, and remember that.</sentence><sentence id="3265">Of course they would -- had the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> before, they're still -- so they're getting the old customers coming back, come and eat.</sentence><sentence id="3266">Some widowers, or single people, lost their family.</sentence><sentence id="3267">So they used to come in the evening and se -- were served things.</sentence><sentence id="3268">Whether they paid or not, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="3269">But they kind of resumed the sort of role [indecipherable] that was their past life, and lot of war stories were coming around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3270">You know, sort of hearing these things, the -- we were kind of a special case, now we had one experience, people had very different experience.</sentence><sentence id="3271">The hiding, some survived, but only, you know, one person.</sentence><sentence id="3272">And some people were traumatized, and completely troubled.</sentence><sentence id="3273">And I remember one man, he used to come to visit [indecipherable] Berger to talk or his despair -- despair.</sentence><sentence id="3274">And I remember he was a very sad person, and he really -- when that man came in in the evening, we would kind of shoot out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3275">And a month or so later we learned he committed suicide.</sentence><sentence id="3276">So those kind of things, you k -- that was the ac -- different things were going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span>, it was -- it was not a normal return to life, again.</sentence><sentence id="3277">These people, the Bergers, at this <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, also kept kosher, obviously.</sentence><sentence id="3278">And basically ate dairy, because they didn't have any dishes and cutlery for meat, and moreover, meat was very scarce anyhow, because that time the only meat you could get, kosher meat was in cans, preserved.</sentence><sentence id="3279">But because of their hospitality reputation, and restaurant reputation, the soldiers in the Jewish brigade, who passed through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span>, or from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, stopped in ou -- those who kept kosher, stayed in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, or ate in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="3280">But they brought their rations over to the Bergers, so the only time we ate meat was to eat those rations the first time, after many years eating meat.</sentence><sentence id="3281">But didn't have enough cutlery, or -- and no plates.</sentence><sentence id="3282">So the cans were warmed up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>, and we passed around the can and this cutlery in order to eat.</sentence><sentence id="3283">That's the kind of -- for them it must have been a terribly painful contrast after being a elegant <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> with all the trappings of a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span>, having to serve their own in this way.</sentence><sentence id="3284">But they made -- they made the transition, we'll open up another <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> a number of years.</sentence></p></dialogue>
