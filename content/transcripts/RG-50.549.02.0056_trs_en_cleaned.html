<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Circumstances, okay.</sentence><sentence id="68">Well, I was in the labor came and one day my older friend approached me and said, Cornell, next morning when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulls out from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span>, you and I are staying, and we going to hide someplace.</sentence><sentence id="69">We are not leaving with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">Cause the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going on and on and on of course.</sentence><sentence id="71">And, of course, my -- my closest friends were my age, see, he was a little bit older, maybe wiser, and he had certain ideas, you see.</sentence><sentence id="72">So next day as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was ready to pull out, and that</sentence></p><p><sentence id="75">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 4 was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hunga</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, of course, he -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move and I had sort of, you know my younger friends, they were all going up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I was ready to move on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he grabbed -- fortunately he grabbed my arm, he says, we're staying.</sentence><sentence id="76">And we didn't stay.</sentence><sentence id="77">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out, and then we hit the <span class="DLF">road</span>, and we walked on the <span class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="78">And after awhile we got off the <span class="DLF">highway</span>, because it was dangerous, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were coming with Hungarian soldiers, and maybe German soldiers, we didn't want to stay on the <span class="DLF">highway</span>, too obvious.</sentence><sentence id="79">So we moved off the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and about maybe quarter of a mile, half a mile, and there was some water there, and some little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, and we just sat down there and was waiting for the dark.</sentence><sentence id="80">We're thinking what's going to happen now, see?</sentence><sentence id="81">Actually it was -- well, it was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in no -- ru -- th-that -- it was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> at that time, yeah, because it was always back and forth <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and back and forth.</sentence><sentence id="82">And before it got dark, some Hungarian soldiers stopped on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> and came towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">So we got sort of a little bit scared, but then you have to act cool, right?</sentence><sentence id="84">And as they were getting closer and closer, we got up and we waved to them.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="85">[indecipherable] come over here, here is the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span>, see?</sentence><sentence id="86">Came over, sa -- and they came over and then one of them asked us, he says, what are you doing?</sentence><sentence id="87">We says, ah, we got late -- we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- w-we missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, we're waiting.</sentence><sentence id="88">Oh.</sentence><sentence id="89">They didn't make a big issue out of it, we're lucky.</sentence><sentence id="90">Then they left.</sentence><sentence id="91">Later it became dark.</sentence><sentence id="92">A Romanian farmer came across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and he said he is willing to hide us.</sentence><sentence id="93">So all right.</sentence><sentence id="94">Actually it was four of us, yeah, this older guy, me and two other guys</sentence></p><p><sentence id="97">USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 5 [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="98">So, we accepted, what choice do you have, right?</sentence><sentence id="99">So we went -- he took us to his little <span class="DLF">farm</span> and we went upstairs in his <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we were hiding there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="100">We were hiding for a few days and suddenly we hear guns, guns, guns, Russian guns getting closer and closer.</sentence><sentence id="101">We had food, we fed us potatoes, we're not hungry,

him, I says -- some -- somewhat we conversed, you know.</sentence><sentence id="107">I said, why are you taking my watch?</sentence><sentence id="108">He says, I have to give it to the Russians. [</sentence><sentence id="109">indecipherable] okay.</sentence><sentence id="110">The next Romanian took my shoes, which I didn't mind because it had nails from <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, you know?</sentence><sentence id="111">So he gave me his shoes.</sentence><sentence id="112">I think it was a good trade.</sentence><sentence id="113">Anyway, so then we -- no, says, well let's start an -- let's start walking.</sentence><sentence id="114">Walking the -- th-the aim, the goal was to reach his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, which was probably hundred miles from there, roughly.</sentence><sentence id="115">So we're walking, maybe we get some rides.</sentence><sentence id="116">So we walked on the <span class="DLF">highway</span>, see?</sentence><sentence id="117">And so the Russian Cossacks on horses on the <span class="DLF">highway</span>, shooting apple off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="118">And then came a Russian -- Russian soldiers, you know, on -- on -- on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, they stopped, and they asked us, they said what -- who are you?</sentence><sentence id="119">Says, well we are, you know, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">Th-Th -- actually didn't know exactly what you are talking about, this -- they didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="121">What do they know?</sentence><sentence id="122">So it's -- one</sentence><sentence id="124">ontactnstbnancedjusietneeg for tarher biormatierabouttfisentecion USHMM Archives RG-50.549.02*0056 6 [indecipherable] ask who -- who -- where you from?</sentence><sentence id="125">I says, I am from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="126">He says, wh-wh-why aren't you fighting with the partisans?

there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="201">We -- I don't know how long I will stay, but I was very lucky.</sentence><sentence id="202">I remember one day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, I was walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span>, and came these Russian soldiers, surrounded a whole <span class="DLF">block</span> and took
