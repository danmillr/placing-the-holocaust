id="1001">And it didn't take too long, and in the morning, the Germans started to march in.</sentence><sentence id="1002">So, we left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we went to some of our workers.</sentence><sentence id="1003">We stayed there all day.</sentence><sentence id="1004">And then we decided we have to go to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1005">To see what, what will it be with us?</sentence><sentence id="1006">Of course, in those times there was no, no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span>, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1007">They just, well, people lived under the German occupations.</sentence><sentence id="1008">It was scary.</sentence><sentence id="1009">There was a lot of things going on.</sentence><sentence id="1010">But, we did not expect what we had later on.</sentence><sentence id="1011">And, but we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we lived for awhile.</sentence><sentence id="1012">On the second day, for example, I was standing in the <span class="DLF">window</span> and a couple of Germans walked up to us and one German looks up and I had a watch in my hand.</sentence><sentence id="1013">And he said, give me the watch.</sentence><sentence id="1014">I'm in my <span

minute.</sentence><sentence id="1020">You'll be dead.</sentence><sentence id="1021">Give him the watch.</sentence><sentence id="1022">So, of course, I took off the watch and I give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="1023">But I still thought, yeah, we are somebody in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, I don't have to give it to him.</sentence><sentence id="1024">And then it didn't .</sentence><sentence id="1030">4 matter, they could take whatever they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="1031">But, we were in one way lucky.</sentence><sentence id="1032">Because our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was very big.</sentence><sentence id="1033">It was a two story and as they were coming in more and more, they occupied for the main stop, for the main <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, so the Germans, the very important Germans used to stay in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1034">And right away they put up a note, that nobody is allowed to come in there.</sentence><sentence id="1035">So, we actually did not suffer too much.</sentence><sentence id="1036">In a way, they used to take out some people.</sentence><sentence id="1037">For example, if a man with a beard, they used to follow him if he went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, and then cut his beard off or beat him up or something.</sentence><sentence id="1038">We did not feel it in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because nobody was allowed, the access wasn't allowed to come into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
