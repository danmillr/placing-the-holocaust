<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: So that probably happened shortly after the Anschluss, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: Beforeactually before the <span class="DLF">Anschluss</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">It was in between the marchin (ph) because when she left, the man who stamped her papers told my mother, "Be sure to go to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and vote about the Anschluss."</sentence><sentence id="250">He was thinking, Good Aryan, she'll vote yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="254">Q: For the Anschluss, yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="256">A: So it was part of, you know, this interim period.</sentence><sentence id="257">And then I have a memory that must have been around Kristallnacht, because I remember comingwalking with my grandmother, and we passed where my <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> was.</sentence><sentence id="258">And as I said, it was run by a Jewish organization, and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> pulling away with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and broken things on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and broken glass.</sentence><sentence id="259">So I think that probably was around that time maybe, Kristallnacht.</sentence><sentence id="260">And then the next thing, my father took me to the parkI think it was right before he was going to leaveand at first he had thought he would take me along but then</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="261">Q: To <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, right?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="262">A: No, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="263">And then I think he got a little bit more realistic, that a sixyearold trying to climb illegally over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> wouldn't work too well.</sentence><sentence id="264">So that was when he tried to teach me a few words of English, thinking my mother is more likely to be able to get me to join her.</sentence><sentence id="265">My parents realized immediately that there was not a hope if they didn't each go out as quickly as possible and then try and bring me out.</sentence><sentence id="266">So my mother, in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, was trying to get papers for me to join her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
