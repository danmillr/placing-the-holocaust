<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="63">Q: Let me interrupt for a moment.</sentence><sentence id="64">What did you know about what was going on in Europe in terms of national security?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Not very much, really.</sentence><sentence id="68">We knew that the Jews were being mistreated and there were massacres.</sentence><sentence id="69">That information reached us through the mass media.</sentence><sentence id="70">And we knew it was a war for democracy to survive.</sentence><sentence id="71">And it had this Jewish component, which I felt very strongly about.</sentence><sentence id="72">And so at the end of the war -- and I don't remember the name of the people -- it was somebody who worked for a congressman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> who approached me and said, you know, UNRRA is looking for people to work in their program.</sentence><sentence id="73"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> had two</sentence><sentence id="75">programs after the war.</sentence><sentence id="76">They had a program for refugees, and they had a program for <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which had suffered at the hands of the Axis.</sentence><sentence id="77">There the country programs were designed to ship goods, needed goods, to strengthen -- to begin the pouring of life blood into the economy.</sentence><sentence id="78">There was a big program in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="79">Some in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">None in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and, of course, the very big one in the <span class="REGION">Far East</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81">Which really attracted me, you know.</sentence><sentence id="82">I wanted to go someplace, and I asked for <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">And then, one day, I was at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> after I had been accepted -- and it was sort of touch and go, because of my health problems with the military, but I made it.</sentence><sentence id="84">And I was now at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> getting briefed, educated on the whole program.</sentence><sentence id="85">And somebody from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA headquarters</span> came over to speak to us.</sentence><sentence id="86">And he said to me, "Why are you going to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span>?"</sentence><sentence id="87">I really didn't have a good reason, you know, except I wanted to see that part of the world.</sentence><sentence id="88">And he said, "You come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">Do you speak Yiddish?"</sentence><sentence id="90">and I said, "Yes, I do speak Yiddish."</sentence><sentence id="91">And he said, "You must go -- our people -- he was Jewish, too -- are in desperate trouble over there."</sentence><sentence id="92">And they were, you know, after the war.</sentence><sentence id="93">And we need Yiddish speaking staff.</sentence><sentence id="94">And I want you to go."</sentence><sentence id="95">And I went.</sentence><sentence id="96">And I was trained for just about a month.</sentence><sentence id="97">We had seminars and all the rest, and I took off.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="131">Q: What was the preparation like?</sentence><sentence id="132">What was the training like?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="135">A: Well, first of all, they told us structurally what the program was about, who supplied what, and what was the chain of responsibility.</sentence><sentence id="136">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, the principal responsibility for refugee programs lay with the military.</sentence><sentence id="137">And they were very unwilling participants in the program.</sentence><sentence id="138">They didn't want -- "We're not welfare workers.</sentence><sentence id="139">And we're not --" You know, some of the things which were being said.</sentence><sentence id="140">They had no taste for it.</sentence><sentence id="141">Refugees are a terrible pain in the behind in getting in the way of the movement of troops and materiel, and they just distract the military from its principal mission.</sentence><sentence id="142">And so now <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was designated to work as the agency of the occupation forces in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>, running these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span></sentence><sentence id="143">Staffed <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> by international personnel, people -- United Nations agency, therefore, the people were drawn from Western powers, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, the <span class="REGION">Benelux countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">We had a Swiss on my team, and Americans.</sentence><sentence id="145">And so we learned about that chain of command and some of the problems.</sentence><sentence id="146">By the way, they really didn't know too much about the problems.</sentence><sentence id="147">There was a great dissociation between what was happening in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and what these people knew in the <span class="BUILDING">national headquarters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">And that's a constant difficulty.</sentence><sentence id="149">And then we took off.</sentence><sentence id="150">And we -- I remember I went on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gripsholm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">I was put aboard with a group of UNRRA people.</sentence><sentence id="152"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gripsholm</span>, which had been during the war, an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">exchange ship</span> for diplomats.</sentence><sentence id="153">It is not the present-day</sentence><sentence id="155"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gripsholm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="156">There are new Gripsholms.</sentence><sentence id="157">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gripsholm</span> was a real rat trap.</sentence><sentence id="158">During the war, it had exchanged diplomatic people, Japanese from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span>, etc.,</sentence><sentence id="159">and reverse.</sentence><sentence id="160">And I spent ten seasick days on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gripsholm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">And I think we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span>, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">And there we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for two or three weeks getting more briefings.</sentence><sentence id="163">And then came the day they say, "You are off."</sentence><sentence id="164">And I was sent by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> on the Orient-Express, but it was not that fabulous Orient-Express.</sentence><sentence id="165">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, I was immediately whisked as the supply officer for UNRRA team, I think it was 560 if I am not mistaken, outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">Shall I go on?</sentence><sentence id="167">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> there which had just been established, I think in December of "45.</sentence><sentence id="168">I arrived about February, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="169">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="170">In the early part of the year.</sentence><sentence id="171">It was the winter.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: 1946?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: "46.</sentence><sentence id="214">And a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had been established by General McNarmey, who was Eisenhower's successor as the SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allies Expeditionary Force) commander or something.</sentence><sentence id="215">And they had evacuated a whole zedlum (ph) silek?</sentence><sentence id="216">of settlements of small <span class="BUILDING">bungalows</span>, I think about 250 such <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, which had been sold by the Nazis, built by the Nazis, for German workers, defense industry workers and their families.</sentence><sentence id="217">Two or three, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> -- two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> apiece, and downstairs was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="218">It was in the 1930s style.</sentence><sentence id="219">There was no gas in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="220">For example, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> were fed with, and the heat was created by, use of firewood.</sentence><sentence id="221">But it was nice.</sentence><sentence id="222">I mean, until we began to stuff the people who were coming in, into these <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">More than -- you would say in each <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, if you had 250 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, you had four or five people.</sentence><sentence id="224">That would have been maybe 1200 people, but we had as much as 3,000 at one time.</sentence><sentence id="225">And it was beyond its capacity.</sentence><sentence id="226">When I arrived, and the Jews who came into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were infiltrees (infiltrators?).</sentence><sentence id="227">They were not, by and large, survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="228">It is estimated, I have read estimates, figures -- accurate figures are very, very difficult to come by.</sentence><sentence id="229">There was so much disorganization. --</sentence><sentence id="230">that there were no more than 35,000 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish concentration camp</span> survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="232">And most, many of the survivors that we got were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> survivors.</sentence><sentence id="233">The Germans had tried to destroy -- there was a plan to march all of the haftling, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> to a <span class="DLF">quarry</span>, a big <span class="DLF">quarry</span>, down south near the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span>, which, I understand, had been prepared with explosives.</sentence><sentence id="234">And to march them into this <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and then blow the whole thing up.</sentence><sentence id="235">But the 3rd Army was approaching and at a certain critical moment, the Germans decided they weren't going to risk the arrival of the Americans, and they simply dropped the whole project.</sentence><sentence id="238">Left the Jews where they were standing and took off.</sentence><sentence id="239">And, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> had also what is described as ""aussencommandos" that is, branches of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> where Jews were sent in various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in what's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberbayern</span>, that is <span class="REGION">Southern Bavaria</span>, to work as farmers on <span class="REGION">farmland</span> under the supervision of the owners.</sentence><sentence id="240">Or in some cases, in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>, or some cases, directly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="241">But, so we had a lot of Jews scattered over the landscape between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> and the <span class="DLF">Austrian border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="242">Little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mittenwalde</span>, which is a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">violin town</span>, had Jews working there in various jobs.</sentence><sentence id="243">And they suffered, you know, they were not fed well.</sentence><sentence id="244">They were beaten, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="245">But it was not an <span class="BUILDING">extermination center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">So, those people came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, a lot of them, and many of them, stayed in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">And we would reach out to them from our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="248">Anyway, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was just recently set up, and most of the people who were infiltrees who came in from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="249">Jews who may have, who were mostly in the Soviet Union during the war.</sentence><sentence id="250">And I think Jewish agencies, important Jewish agencies, like the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee) and HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), and the Jewish Agency for Palestine became voluntary agencies under the supervision of UNRRA, who were to assign some of their people, welfare workers and others to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">teams</span>, to help the international personnel administer the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and to provide services.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="364">Q: Were there men who were coming in doing the same thing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="366">A: Yeah, we had men, also, but I remember that the welfare workers were women.</sentence><sentence id="367">I told you, I recall one was Rose Wasserman, a wonderful lady who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="368">And she was with, I think, it's <span class="BUILDING">Cuyahoga County Courts</span>.</sentence><sentence id="369">She was the chief welfare officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="370">And she did a wonderful job with <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , yeah.</sentence><sentence id="371">And then we had to provide food.</sentence><sentence id="372">Now food, under an agreement made with the military, was a responsibility of the Germans to provide food, and also to provide money, marks, to pay workers.</sentence><sentence id="373">We had salaried workers.</sentence><sentence id="374">The problem with the marks was that they were worthless.</sentence><sentence id="375">I think, from a nominal value, I think of four to the dollar before the war.</sentence><sentence id="376">A few years later, they were selling for 400 a dollar, and they went up to 4000 a dollar.</sentence><sentence id="377">They were really worthless.</sentence><sentence id="378">But it was important to get them on the worker's list because you did get better -- more calories.</sentence><sentence id="379">We had a specific, specified calorie count that we fed the families.</sentence><sentence id="380">And so you got more calories.</sentence><sentence id="381">And then there were some other privileges for people who</sentence><sentence id="383">were working.</sentence><sentence id="384">We had a limited number of jobs, you know, a place like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span>, with about 2,500 people.</sentence><sentence id="385">We maybe had 200 or 300, maybe 400 people.</sentence><sentence id="386">There were people who would load wood for firewood, cooks, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> of various sorts.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="422">A: Yeah no, yeah, well, the jobs went based on the gender attached to the job.</sentence><sentence id="423">That is, a Arankenschwester was a kranken nurse, you know, was a woman.</sentence><sentence id="424">We had some nurses.</sentence><sentence id="425">You know, you'd never see a man who was a nurse.</sentence><sentence id="426">All of the doctors were men, the dentists were men, one or two exceptions.</sentence><sentence id="427">And the women were clerks.</sentence><sentence id="428">They helped people fill out their DP documents.</sentence><sentence id="429">I will talk about those in a moment.</sentence><sentence id="430">And there were people who did various clerical tasks, and that was where women could produce, could contribute.</sentence><sentence id="431">We also had a relegazerampt we called it, a <span class="BUILDING">religious office</span>, and some of these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were reserved for <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="432">They're small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and so we had <span class="BUILDING">Rusisha shul</span>, <span class="BUILDING">Russian shul</span>, and a <span class="BUILDING">Poylissha shul</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Polish synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="433">There were two or three, four maybe different branches, and they were separate.</sentence><sentence id="434">And people knew where they wanted to go.</sentence><sentence id="435">We had to find rabbis, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="436">I had an American assistant who went around looking for people with beards, and they were designated rabbis.</sentence><sentence id="437">These Jews, by the way, the Hasidic Jewish community, and we had some that came, were clearly identifiable.</sentence><sentence id="438">We wondered, you know, how they'd made it through the war, but they were in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> during the war.</sentence><sentence id="439">And then we began the distribution of food.</sentence><sentence id="440">We set up <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="441">Now, these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> so that people could cook, take their food and cook as they pleased.</sentence><sentence id="442">And then we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">community kitchen</span> where we had people come who were single, who had no family, to eat their three meals a day.</sentence><sentence id="443">We had to supply the military with a Table of Organization for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the purpose of salaries.</sentence><sentence id="444">We had to justify all the salaries.</sentence><sentence id="445">And the religious ampt I remember, gave us a problem because they needed people to erect an eruwv -- this wire around, you know about it, around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> during the Sabbath.</sentence><sentence id="446">I remember this colonel saying, "What is that?</sentence><sentence id="447">What kind of wire</sentence><sentence id="449">around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="450">What are you talking about?"</sentence><sentence id="451">Ultimately, when we built a mikvah in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="452">I remember I had to explain the meaning of a mikvah and why they had people who did certain personal -- I am not sure what happens in a mikvah, but they rendered personal service, clipping toenails.</sentence><sentence id="453">Someone was kidding me, he said, takes lint out of the <span class="DLF">navels</span>, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="454">They were all paid for.</sentence><sentence id="455">And, then, we had some special food habits, you know, for the Hassidim needed kosher food.</sentence><sentence id="456">And we had a real problem with that.</sentence><sentence id="457">I don't remember how we solved it.</sentence><sentence id="458">I think we went to a butcher, a German place where meat was slaughtered, and we had a -- what do you call the guy who does the slaughtering?</sentence><sentence id="459">I am forgetting my Yiddish, you know -- who slaughters the animals.</sentence><sentence id="460">And he was a hasid.</sentence><sentence id="461">And the meat was taken, carefully handled.</sentence><sentence id="462">Milk for lactating mothers, those women who were pregnant, the cows had to be milked under supervision by a rabbi.</sentence><sentence id="463">They assigned somebody to go and sit in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> with the -- we had to provide transportation.</sentence><sentence id="464">It was a very complex thing.</sentence><sentence id="465">We had a lot of illness.</sentence><sentence id="466">We had a lot of people with tuberculosis.</sentence><sentence id="467">They were taken out, weaned out, and we sent them to - - we had a <span class="BUILDING">tuberculosis center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Reichenhall</span>, nearby.</sentence><sentence id="468">We had medical examinations.</sentence><sentence id="469">There was a big problem with bad teeth.</sentence><sentence id="470">Now, we issued DP cards, identity cards.</sentence><sentence id="471">So they had an identity card from the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> with a thumb print, no pictures, a finger print.</sentence><sentence id="472">There was also a DP card kept in our files.</sentence><sentence id="473">Now these people arrived mostly after December and when they arrived, they were not aware that the Truman Directive, signed in early December, I think, which allocated a large number of visa numbers.</sentence><sentence id="474">The military was very wary about infiltrees, about the increasing number of people coming from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>.</sentence><sentence id="475">And the British also understood that the larger the number of Jewish displaced persons in the <span class="REGION">American zones</span>, that the greater the pressure would be on them in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and in other forums to relinquish the mandate in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or part of the mandate for the Jews, or to admit more Jews into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="476">Something they did not wish to do.</sentence><sentence id="477">So the Americans, who didn't want DPs generally, General Patton was in command in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, and he was not terribly sympathetic to the Jews, tried to shut them off from coming by, declaring that in order to emigrate from the <span class="REGION">American zones</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, you had to show that you had arrived in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> prior to December 22, 1945.</sentence><sentence id="478">And so, these people who came in January, they were not aware of this, you know.</sentence><sentence id="479">And they gave accurately that they had arrived in January or early February and that their place of birth was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, a place not favored by the realities of the quota system, the</sentence><sentence id="481">national origins quota system.</sentence><sentence id="482">They would have to sit in Europe for years before they got out.</sentence><sentence id="483">But they were being truthful, and they said who they were and when they came and all of the rest.</sentence><sentence id="484">Later on, they found to their unhappiness, that disqualified them.</sentence><sentence id="485">They said, "Had I known, I would have told them I came here earlier."</sentence><sentence id="486">We thought about it, by the way I've used the metaphor, you know, it was December 22 which they made the cutoff date, that on the 25th where Christmas was celebrated, there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">inn</span>, our <span class="BUILDING">inn</span>, for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="487">And anyway, we got them all into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we created our own health programs, under the supervision of international medical people, and our own feeding programs, our own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="488">Right away, the Jews were energetic.</sentence><sentence id="489">They set up everything they needed, cultural programs, newspapers began to sprout.</sentence><sentence id="490">Now, prior to that time, there was a question early on at the end of the war, how would these people be housed, the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="491">They were, after all, multi-national -- Poles and Ukrainians and Jews.</sentence><sentence id="492">And a Jew was nominally -- most of them were nominally Polish, Polish nationals.</sentence><sentence id="493">And so therefore, they would take a whole bunch of Poles, Polish speaking people, and put them, try to put them into one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, into one <span class="REGION">area</span>, under one administration.</sentence><sentence id="494">But, you know, the Jews did not consider themselves Polish anymore.</sentence><sentence id="495">They would not opt in a legal sense, for that identity.</sentence><sentence id="496">And so, they -- I am not quite sure how it happened -- but they all declared themselves, I think maybe for immigration purposes, as staatenlos that is, stateless, or as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="497">Now, there was a great deal of jockeying around over how the Jews would be housed, whether they would be housed among the people, as I say, of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in which they were born, which they didn't want.</sentence><sentence id="498">American-Jewish leaders were also, I think, playing a role in that thing.</sentence><sentence id="499">And they wanted all of the Jews together, which was a wise thing to happen.</sentence><sentence id="500">And ultimately, the military gave in.</sentence><sentence id="501">For them, you know, looking directly at it, or for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> looking directly at it, these were Poles or Latvians or Lithuanians.</sentence><sentence id="502">But, no, they did not consider themselves that.</sentence><sentence id="503">And so they all became of one national group.</sentence><sentence id="504">And in all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in which Jews lived after the war, they lived together, surrounded by a <span class="DLF">fence</span>, whose <span class="DLF">perimeter</span> was often patrolled by Jewish police.</sentence><sentence id="505">We organized the police force.</sentence><sentence id="506">We had a police force in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> alone of over 100 people.</sentence><sentence id="507">They were not armed police, but they were Jews who wore armbands declaring that they were policemen, and they patrolled the perimeters of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="508">Conditions were so bad in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="509">At this time, I was the supply officer for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann camp</span> and all of the small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> I mentioned before, which had sprung loose from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span></sentence><sentence id="511">0 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="512">And also for all "free living" Jews in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="513">In effect, I became ultimately sort of the mayor of the Jewish community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="514">And they would come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="515">They were Polish Jews, mostly.</sentence><sentence id="516">There were very few German Jews remaining in -- just a very few that I ran across, who would come to us for food, identity papers certifying that they were stateless, or that they had been persecutees, and therefore, entitled to certain privileges as to immigration, food, medical care, clothing, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="517">And as I say, conditions were so bad that in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> was hearing about it.</sentence><sentence id="518">There was a lot of anguish, a lot of anger, and so Eisenhower was sent by Truman to Europe to investigate.</sentence><sentence id="519">There had been a report by the Harrison Committee which had stressed some of these inadequacies, but Eisenhower went over to look, he said, for himself.</sentence><sentence id="520">And what happened was, a week before he arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, the director of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> quit.</sentence><sentence id="521">He wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="522">I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="523">Anyway, and so I was called by <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> saying would I make myself ready to receive the General and to brief him on whatever questions he wanted to be raised.</sentence><sentence id="524">And sure enough, two or three days before the arrival of the General, all of the security people, military security people, came and checked the whole <span class="DLF">road</span> running down to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> out to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">For security purposes, they emptied <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with <span class="DLF">windows</span> overlooking the <span class="DLF">road</span>, the whole business.</sentence><sentence id="526">I was very impressed, of course.</sentence><sentence id="527">And on that day, we were laid on and out came the General, riding in -- it had to be either Goering or Hitler's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="528">And he was accompanied, of course, by six or eight general officers.</sentence><sentence id="529">You were going to ask something?</sentence><sentence id="530">McNarney was among them, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Huebner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="531">I remember those names.</sentence><sentence id="532">And they came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they spent -- I greeted them as he stepped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="533">He spent about three or four hours, I guess, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="534">And we talked about supplies.</sentence><sentence id="535">He went and looked at it.</sentence><sentence id="536">We talked about <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>; he went and looked at the <span class="BUILDING">housing</span>.</sentence><sentence id="537">He talked to the people.</sentence><sentence id="538">A great big sign had been hung by the Jews over the <span class="DLF">entry</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, "Welcome General Eisenhower."</sentence><sentence id="539">And I was impressed.</sentence><sentence id="540">He's a very stern-looking guy, very impressive you know, with all of those stars.</sentence><sentence id="541">And some of his staff took notes on what I was saying.</sentence><sentence id="542">And I think it had an impact, my own contribution to that, because within a matter of maybe a month, things began to improve.</sentence><sentence id="543">We were getting things that we were not getting before.</sentence><sentence id="544">Of course, the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> had played its role, but Eisenhower coming over there was the basis for making whatever changes were necessary.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="679">Q: How honestly could you talk to him?</sentence><sentence id="680">I mean, here you are, a 25-year-old young man?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="683">A: Well, I could talk pretty honestly.</sentence><sentence id="684">I just told him, "General, the situation's tragic.</sentence><sentence id="685">We have people, you know, stuffed into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> together in such numbers -- the people are sick, their ability to resist disease is down.</sentence><sentence id="686">And so, we are going to have typhus.</sentence><sentence id="687">We are going to have this, and we're going to have that.</sentence><sentence id="688">They are not getting adequate food."</sentence><sentence id="689">And he listened carefully.</sentence><sentence id="690">I remember, though, some funny scenes.</sentence><sentence id="691">We took him into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="692">And the guy who was the director of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a fellow who then went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span>.</sentence><sentence id="693">His name was Spector.</sentence><sentence id="694">Mr. Spector was a teacher, and both he and his wife were dedicated.</sentence><sentence id="695">He and his wife were wonderfully dedicated people.</sentence><sentence id="696">They set up the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with teachers, and the children, they got paper and they got pencils.</sentence><sentence id="697">It was very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="698">I told you "<span class="BUILDING">IMCA" YMCA</span> supplied us with writing pads for the Jewish children.</sentence><sentence id="699">And he had coached the children to sing "The Star Spangled Banner", in just learning the <span class="DLF">lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="700">They didn't know what they were saying.</sentence><sentence id="701">And Eisenhower stood there, you know, his hat under his arm, and he listened as they sang.</sentence><sentence id="702">And when it was finished, I was stunned.</sentence><sentence id="703">I didn't tell Spector until much later.</sentence><sentence id="704">He said to me, "What are they singing?"</sentence><sentence id="705">He didn't recognize it at all.</sentence><sentence id="706">I wouldn't spoil what these children had done.</sentence><sentence id="707">There was also some confusion.</sentence><sentence id="708">He walked into a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, I remember, and he took his hat off, you know.</sentence><sentence id="709">And McNarney leaned over him and says, "General, put your hat on.</sentence><sentence id="710">You're in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>."</sentence><sentence id="711">It was a pleasant visit.</sentence><sentence id="712">The Jews were extremely welcoming to him, applauded.</sentence><sentence id="713">He was the great hero who had liberated them.</sentence><sentence id="714">And it was a wonderful day.</sentence><sentence id="715">He is a stern-looking guy, you know.</sentence><sentence id="716">He has his dignity, very little joking around with him, my impression.</sentence><sentence id="717">I wouldn't want to cross him, based on what I saw.</sentence><sentence id="718">Anyway, the visit went well.</sentence><sentence id="719">And as a result, as a matter of fact, in about a couple of weeks, I was notified that I had been appointed director to replace the departed director.</sentence><sentence id="720">And, that situation went on for, I think, until 1947 when we learned that <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was going to be terminated, go out of business.</sentence><sentence id="721">And that it was to be replaced by an agency known as the PCIRO, Preparatory Committee or Commission for the International Refugee Organization.</sentence><sentence id="722">And that a new modus operandi was to take place.</sentence><sentence id="723">That is, many of the international personnel on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">team</span> were to be terminated.</sentence><sentence id="724">And their responsibilities were to be turned over to indigenous staff-people, essentially, the Jews themselves, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="725">And there would be no camp director for a given <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>; he would be replaced by a camp chairman.</sentence><sentence id="726">And he had a sort of a</sentence><sentence id="728">2 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> with him for food, and welfare and <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and security and whatever.</sentence><sentence id="729">And that the Jews were to pick their own people.</sentence><sentence id="730">And they did so with elections in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="731">And it was marvelously organized.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="783">Q: Can we not get to 1947 first, can we stay ...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="785">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="787">Q: What happened to you when you became director?</sentence><sentence id="788">You became director of this camp --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="791">A: Of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="793">Q: -- and the subsidiaries?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="795">A: -- the subsidiaries and the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="796">That is, I was responsible for meeting their needs.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="799">Q: How many people, then, are you responsible for?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="801">A: I think at that point it got to be about 3,000, 3,500, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="802">And what I would do is move around through the various installations under my supervision and meet with their chairman and find out what their problems were.</sentence><sentence id="803">Maybe once a week, I would be in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, drive around.</sentence><sentence id="804">I would drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, go around and meet with them.</sentence><sentence id="805">But my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in the <span class="BUILDING">Zedlum</span>, (ph) in the Neu Freimann.</sentence><sentence id="806">I supervised all of the programs and saw how they went and people reported to me.</sentence><sentence id="807">And I reported to my superiors.</sentence><sentence id="808">Life was very, very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="809">People were trying to get out, and they soon found that the national origins quota defeated that.</sentence><sentence id="810">There was illegal immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="811">And by the way, I recall now that I had very good part of the people on the Exodus who came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann camp</span> and from nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="812">You know, the Exodus was caught and returned to Ger -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> and the Jews were forced off, you know, by British, I think it was British soldiers, with the water hoses.</sentence><sentence id="813">I got, and I lost -- a lot of things happened to me -- a little book written by children who had been on the Exodus and describing their experiences.</sentence><sentence id="814">And they dedicated it to me, to undzer khaver director.</sentence><sentence id="815">I don't know what happened to it.</sentence><sentence id="816">There are things I have lost I regret so.</sentence><sentence id="817">I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="818">And we had to receive other people all the time.</sentence><sentence id="819">There was constant tension.</sentence><sentence id="820">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had been closed to infiltrees, and we were taking them in.</sentence><sentence id="821">One of the ways we were</sentence><sentence id="823">3 able to take them in was when a group of people went illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, their DP cards were left behind.</sentence><sentence id="824">When you leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, you are supposed to turn them in or to do something.</sentence><sentence id="825">They were turned over to the camp committee, who used them for the purpose of supplying other infiltrees coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="826">The UNRRA people told me that apparently we have a very low death rate in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because the population remained fairly static.</sentence><sentence id="827">Actually, they were leaving, but they were being exchanged with other people.</sentence><sentence id="828">And then other ways had to be found to avoid the restrictive immigration policies of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and also of the Canadians.</sentence><sentence id="829">And the documentation, which was on file in our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, on each of the Jews, prevented them if they had to get their DP records to present to the consul generals. (?)</sentence><sentence id="830">They would reveal that they had arrived in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> after December "45, or that they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, and therefore they had to wait for a long time for their quota numbers.</sentence><sentence id="831">Some people had a lot of scars on their lungs, lesions which were healed, but it was not known exactly when the tuberculosis had been active, and they were prevented.</sentence><sentence id="832">So, if you presented an accurate x-ray, you could be out of luck.</sentence><sentence id="833">It was a desperate struggle because everything militated against them -- people who had suffered so.</sentence><sentence id="834">I remember this was said to me, very often, I am going to say it in Yiddish, "Mir haben gemeynt az zey velen uns trogen oyf de pletzes."</sentence><sentence id="835">We thought that when we got out that we would be carried around on the shoulders of the Allies, of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, that we would be heroes for having made it through this terrible experience.</sentence><sentence id="836">Instead, they're finding all kinds of ways to keep us out.</sentence><sentence id="837">It was a terrible disillusion.</sentence><sentence id="838">And while there was a division in the Jewish community of survivors about where they would go, some said they would go nowhere but to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="839">And of course, they knew what was in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="840">It was illegal, first of all.</sentence><sentence id="841">If you managed to get in, you would be housed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> on some mud flat someplace.</sentence><sentence id="842">No jobs.</sentence><sentence id="843">It was a terrible scene.</sentence><sentence id="844">Nevertheless, they wished to go there.</sentence><sentence id="845">But others wished to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="846">They had family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="847">People who would make <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for them and had jobs for them.</sentence><sentence id="848">And they saw their future there.</sentence><sentence id="849">So there was a constant tension within the DP, Jewish DP community on that score.</sentence><sentence id="850">They tried to invest the Jews with the kind of Zionist patriotism, but they were all patriotic about the establishment of the state.</sentence><sentence id="851">But many of them wished to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="852">A commission was sent over by the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="853">And they came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to talk to Jews about where they wished to go.</sentence><sentence id="854">The committee was made up of five diplomats, one of whom was from</sentence><sentence id="856">4 <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> before it was divided.</sentence><sentence id="857">I am trying to remember which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> became a Muslim country, maybe <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="858">And he was very hostile.</sentence><sentence id="859">And he tried to probe, you know, "Where do wish to go?"</sentence><sentence id="860">And they picked some people at random from in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to come before them.</sentence><sentence id="861">There was a big audience in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> listening to this procedure.</sentence><sentence id="862">And I was the interpreter.</sentence><sentence id="863">And the first guy they picked to be examined was the brother of a business associate of my own father, who asked me to get him out.</sentence><sentence id="864">He had arrived with his wife and two children.</sentence><sentence id="865">They had been in the Soviet Union, and he was desperate to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="866">I didn't know what would happen, but they took care of it themselves.</sentence><sentence id="867">That is, the guy asked, after checking his personal history, said to him, "Now, where do you wish to go?"</sentence><sentence id="868">And he proudly spoke up, "Vu alle yiddin forn" he said "Where all Jews wish to go, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eretz Yisrael</span>."</sentence><sentence id="869">And a great cheer broke out.</sentence><sentence id="870">Now, he left a week later for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, so there was a solidarity in support of the claim of Jews for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, for Eretz Yisrael, and for the right of Jews to be allowed to emigrate there.</sentence><sentence id="871">There was 100 percent solidarity, but a lot of people had made decisions about their lives, about where they wished to go.</sentence><sentence id="872">But --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="950">Q: Was there pressure on these people to not go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, not only to not say it --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="952">A: Well, there was some pressure.</sentence><sentence id="953">Yeah, the Jewish Agency was working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and they did a valuable job.</sentence><sentence id="954">And the whole leadership of the Jewish community was Zionist in its orientation.</sentence><sentence id="955">So that when, for example, camp administrations were made up, as I've indicated, they were elected on Zionist lists.</sentence><sentence id="956">Liste eyns, or tsvey -- list one, two.</sentence><sentence id="957">And on that basis, these represented various Zionist political parties.</sentence><sentence id="958">There was a strong, and I think the Jewish Agency and the leaders, Ben Gurion and the rest understood, the value of the DP, Jewish DP community and the experience which the Jews had had -- if you want to call it a value.</sentence><sentence id="959">But they understood the meaning of it, for bringing pressure against the British and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to partition <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or to create a Jewish entity, and to allow the Jews to leave.</sentence><sentence id="960">And for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>, by the way, ultimately when they did go legally, the UN paid all fares for transportation costs for Jewish refugees travelling to whatever <span class="NPIP">destination</span> they were going to.</sentence><sentence id="961">So there was a unity within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="962">And they would never allow it to be understood outside of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="963">There was a unity that <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> would have to be created.</sentence><sentence id="964">It would have to be supported.</sentence><sentence id="965">And those Jews, and there were many</sentence><sentence id="967">5 who wished to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else, would be permitted to go.</sentence><sentence id="968">And there were efforts made.</sentence><sentence id="969">You know there was by the way, also a mobilization effort on the part of the Zionist community, that is, to mobilize Jews, young men and women to serve in the Haganah.</sentence><sentence id="970">They were trained in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="971">They would be marching around and training with broomsticks as bayonets, rifles.</sentence><sentence id="972">So they were preparing themselves.</sentence><sentence id="973">But as I say, you had this tension in the community which is, I think, something which happens today, again, you have in the Soviet Union some of the same things, that is, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> accuses HIAS, Jewish agencies, of talking Jews into not going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, which is absolutely untrue.</sentence><sentence id="974">Jews know where they wish to go.</sentence><sentence id="975">And my own feeling is they should go where they wish to go, where they will be happy.</sentence><sentence id="976">So we had that immigration.</sentence><sentence id="977">Then we had the illegal immigration.</sentence><sentence id="978">I was, I think, the only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> director I know of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="979">There was one or two before me in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, but they had left.</sentence><sentence id="980">So a lot of efforts by the Jewish Agency or by the JDC centered on me.</sentence><sentence id="981">They knew they could come to me and they could speak frankly, and that I was part of the whole apparatus.</sentence><sentence id="982">So I remember supplying blankets and gasoline and other things, illegally -- to people on the move illegally, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="983">Mostly I knew about <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> for immigration.</sentence><sentence id="984">I think the Exodus people took that route, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span>.</sentence><sentence id="985">And I was asked by them, by the Sochnut or by the Brichah to accompany a transport of, I don't remember, maybe 500 Jews who had been gathered up to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> and to board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> there, and to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="986">And so I sat there in the uniform in the lead <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>.</sentence><sentence id="987">And I had some phony document saying that these people are authorized to travel, in transit, through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> on their way, I think, to <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span>, one of those <span class="REGION">South American countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="988">And I carried a group visa with me.</sentence><sentence id="989">It was done also on onion skin paper, which had names listed and birth dates and they absolutely did not conform to the birth dates or to the people in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>.</sentence><sentence id="990">And we drove through the <span class="REGION">French zone</span>, me in the front, and we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muehlhausen</span>, that's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="991">And we presented this transit visa.</sentence><sentence id="992">Well, first of all, the visa from the Uruguayans or one of those Latin American -- they were all fraudulent, provided by some consul, vice consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, maybe.</sentence><sentence id="993">And he had been paid something to do that, I think.</sentence><sentence id="994">And we presented the visas and the transit letter to the French gendarmes at the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="995">In the meantime, two of these guys working from Palestine Brichah, I could see them going around the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span>, with two big cartons, and I knew there were</sentence><sentence id="997">6 cigarettes in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cartons</span>.</sentence><sentence id="998">The French, also, were badly in need of cigarettes, and deposited it there.</sentence><sentence id="999">And then, we were saluted through, and we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span>, and we went to the town square, and by God, I was stunned.</sentence><sentence id="1000">There was the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mulhouse</span>, all dressed up with his red sash across his chest, and women, volunteers, greeted us and provided hot coffee, cocoa or something, and some bread.</sentence><sentence id="1001">Some other food for the people to eat.</sentence><sentence id="1002">We were treated to a speech by the mayor.</sentence><sentence id="1003">Wishing us, wishing our people, a good life in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1004">It was a very nice ceremony.</sentence><sentence id="1005">And I got back in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, drove back over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1006">It's a very -- I did that twice, but only once did the Muehlhausen mayor come out for me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1066">Q: Did you have any hesitancy doing this?</sentence><sentence id="1067">You were after all.....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1070">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="1071">I - I did have -- first of all, 1 am trying to remember whether there were some restrictions on my movement into the <span class="REGION">French zone</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1072">I was crossing a <span class="DLF">zone line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1073">But I remember that if -- if -- somebody had picked this up, they would ask me where did they get the gasoline and the blankets which were military.</sentence><sentence id="1074">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were military.</sentence><sentence id="1075">They were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">UNRRA trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1076">They had it on the front.</sentence><sentence id="1077">So there was a risk.</sentence><sentence id="1078">They were my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> in my <span class="DLF">motor pool</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1079">Yes, there was a risk.</sentence><sentence id="1080">I could have -- I don't know what would have happened.</sentence><sentence id="1081">I imagine, based on some other things I have seen over there, they would have cut me.</sentence><sentence id="1082">I would have been dismissed from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, and they would have sent me immediately <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1083">I don't know whether there would have been any criminal charges, because the military is very leery about getting themselves involved.</sentence><sentence id="1084">It's a public relations problem.</sentence><sentence id="1085">So, it would have been tough on me.</sentence><sentence id="1086">I would have been shipped back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and in some disgrace, not with Jews, I guess.</sentence><sentence id="1087">So there was some risk.</sentence><sentence id="1088">But it's one of my fondest memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1108">Q: What made you do it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1110">A: Well, I was Jewish, and my sense of solidarity with my people, with the people, you know, around me.</sentence><sentence id="1111">I was profoundly sympathetic.</sentence><sentence id="1112">Then, well, there was also the question of how do you get around the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1113">Now, Jews would apply for immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, and when they would come in there, with their documentation, there was a consul general in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, with their DP cards and their records.</sentence><sentence id="1114">It would show they had arrived after December 22nd of "45, and they were automatically eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="1115">I am a little unclear about the immigration laws at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1116">Eventually, a new law was passed in "48, I guess, also very controversial, and very stacked against Jewish</sentence><sentence id="1118">7 DPs and the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where they came from.</sentence><sentence id="1119">But it still remained that they had to be in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> before December 22, 1945 in order to be eligible.</sentence><sentence id="1120">So what would happen was, Jews would come in and say, in effect, to one of my staff people, "I came here after, and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is no good for me.</sentence><sentence id="1121">Here I have this paper saying that I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.127029" long="16.85199">Breslau</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1122"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> were favored, because during the four, five years of the war, Germans were prohibited from emigrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, or after, as ex-enemy nationals.</sentence><sentence id="1123">And so all of these unused numbers -- and Germans had a very big quota for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> under that national origins quota.</sentence><sentence id="1124">These numbers -- Germans who could not use these quota numbers had to stay, and the numbers were saved up and they were turned over to the DPs by the Truman Directive to be used.</sentence><sentence id="1125">All of these used up numbers going back to 1939, or thereabouts.</sentence><sentence id="1126">So that relieved some of the problems.</sentence><sentence id="1127">But the point was, they still operated under the national origins quota, very restrictive.</sentence><sentence id="1128">And under the requirement that they be in a <span class="REGION">zone</span> December 22nd of 1945.</sentence><sentence id="1129">So what happened was such people, if they came and asked for help -- I am going to be very candid here -- we would take out their documents and tear up the document.</sentence><sentence id="1130">Nobody knew the difference.</sentence><sentence id="1131">I was in control of these things.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And put a new DP card in the file.</sentence><sentence id="1133">And I remember in one <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, we had a guy who was an expert at aging these documents.</sentence><sentence id="1134">Of course, they had to be about two or three years old, you know, so if you saw a fresh, the paper was lousy, if you saw a fresh white paper, you knew it was fresh.</sentence><sentence id="1135">So we had them stacked on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiators</span> to age them a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1136">And then they would bring these papers in, and it didn't take long before the consul generals, they are pretty bright people, understood that there was something not kosher about these.</sentence><sentence id="1137">A lot of people came in, declared they were born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, but had no German accent.</sentence><sentence id="1138">You know, they spoke strong Yiddish, and there was some cockamamie story made up to cover that.</sentence><sentence id="1139">And then they were asked finally to find some document that you told somebody, and it was true, if you were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>, and you didn't keep your birth certificate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1140">They would say write away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in which you were born.</sentence><sentence id="1141">And many of them said they were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span>, <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> where it could not be checked.</sentence><sentence id="1142">Russians were occupying <span class="REGION">East Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1143">And well, first, they would say "Look, I didn't have any papers.</sentence><sentence id="1144">And I have written, here is a copy of a registered letter which I sent to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East German city</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1145">There were all sorts of means to get out, to get around these restrictive laws or regulations.</sentence><sentence id="1146">The German quota was an important one.</sentence><sentence id="1147">Sometimes they would go up to some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> someplace,</sentence><sentence id="1149">8 where it was learned there were some birth certificates or birth documents for people who had died already.</sentence><sentence id="1150">And they would get these, maybe having to bribe an official.</sentence><sentence id="1151">But it was a survival struggle.</sentence><sentence id="1152">And we countenanced it all.</sentence><sentence id="1153">Some years ago, I met a guy had been the U.S. Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> in the State Department.</sentence><sentence id="1154">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> to make a speech, and I sat next to him at a lunch.</sentence><sentence id="1155">I recognized his name, and when his bio was read, I remembered he was vice consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, way back when I was there.</sentence><sentence id="1156">I told him, "I don't know whether you remember me, but I used to come in and plead the case that the people were unjustly denied.</sentence><sentence id="1157">I would come down to see them."</sentence><sentence id="1158">And he said he remembered me.</sentence><sentence id="1159">He said, "I know that you had" -- what he called "a <span class="BUILDING">document factory</span>" out there, near one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> nearby."</sentence><sentence id="1160">I said, "We probably did."</sentence><sentence id="1161">I mean, they were good people, but they were operating according to the regulations.</sentence><sentence id="1162">By the way, when I spoke to him, he was an Assistant Secretary of State, yeah, Assistant Secretary of State.</sentence><sentence id="1163">Very well known man.</sentence><sentence id="1164">I don't recall his name.</sentence><sentence id="1167">9 Tape 2 Well, we went through a very difficult year 1946 and to 1947, when <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> decided to go out of business, and be replaced by the IRO (International Refugee Organization).</sentence><sentence id="1168">At the same time, the decision was made to evacuate Neu Freimann, and that became one of the most difficult parts of my whole year, my whole stay in this job.</sentence><sentence id="1169"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> was considered a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">privileged camp</span> because it was right on the border of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, and therefore, easily accessible to Jewish agencies which had to visit, dealing with various problems, a lot with immigration.</sentence><sentence id="1170">We had the USNA, the United Service for New Americans, which, I think, was like a JDC operation, which processed applications.</sentence><sentence id="1171">We did, too, but they did, I think, a lot of the processing of applications to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1172">The HIAS was there.</sentence><sentence id="1173">There was the Jewish Agency, JAFP, Jewish Agency for Palestine, with Chaim Hoffman as its director.</sentence><sentence id="1174">And there was an extensive <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1175">I want to speak about the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> because that played a very important role, not only in assuring the Jews a way of sustaining themselves -- not only Jews, but anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1176">I mean, it was open to all.</sentence><sentence id="1177">The <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was not a Jewish making, it was a creation of the German merchants who were backed up with merchandise, which they were beginning to produce.</sentence><sentence id="1178">And they could not sell and make anything unless they sold it on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, because the controlled price in German marks, what you would get would be zero.</sentence><sentence id="1179">I could get four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">opera seats</span> for two cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1180"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Opera seats</span> had a nominal value of, let's say, 20 marks apiece.</sentence><sentence id="1181">So the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was really a creation of the economic system.</sentence><sentence id="1182">That has to be understood.</sentence><sentence id="1183">And Jews could not live on the 2,000 calories a person, especially what those calories were made of.</sentence><sentence id="1184">They were made of potatoes and starchy haferflocken, which was a German term for a wheat, a cereal of some sort, dried eggs, dried skim milk.</sentence><sentence id="1185">Jews could not eat dried eggs.</sentence><sentence id="1186">That stuff used to lie and rot in <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1187">One day we discovered, by the way, that a couple of tons of dried skim milk had disappeared from one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1188">It didn't bother us a bit -- except we wanted to know what happened to it -- because the Jews did not enjoy, or take, or drink dried skimmed milk.</sentence><sentence id="1189">But what happened was, about two or three weeks or thereabouts later, we saw wandering around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> Jews carrying a box slung over shoulder shouting "Lody!</sentence><sentence id="1190">Lody!"</sentence><sentence id="1191">Lody is ice cream in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="1192">They had used this milk to manufacture ice cream pops, or something, and they were selling them on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1193">I recall that.</sentence><sentence id="1194">That's very funny, the creativity of our folk.</sentence><sentence id="1195">But, as I say, the packages which came from the JDC, the Jewish relief agencies, were the real waluta, the real currency, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1196">The cigarettes in them, which sold for, I think, a dollar a package -- I mean, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> were 15 cents or something, or maybe more.</sentence><sentence id="1197">I mean, $10 a carton, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1200">0 Coffee, marmalade, jam, fat in cans, other things which were priceless.</sentence><sentence id="1201">They became the basis upon which many Jews -- they could trade them for meat, for bread, for other things to sustain their family.</sentence><sentence id="1202">And so going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> became very important.</sentence><sentence id="1203">People had access either by the few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> which were running, or by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> which they could hitch a ride on to go and do their business.</sentence><sentence id="1204">There was a famous <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1205">I want to mention it, called <span class="DLF">Mohl Strasse</span>, M-o-h-l. I've been back there, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="1206">I once went back some years later to buy some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Meissen Rosenthal china</span> for my mother-in-law.</sentence><sentence id="1207">But it was a great center of <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> currency dealings.</sentence><sentence id="1208">Jews were carrying currency during the war.</sentence><sentence id="1209">Those who were not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentrations camps</span>, those who were in hiding, sewed into the linings of their clothing.</sentence><sentence id="1210">They were carrying many things in order to enable themselves to live, if they ever made it through.</sentence><sentence id="1211">And they went to exchange these dollars for various things, whatever, or to trade them up, in some way to change them.</sentence><sentence id="1212">All currencies into national hard currencies were being traded there.</sentence><sentence id="1213">Not German marks, but Swiss francs and British pounds and American dollars.</sentence><sentence id="1214">And they were subject to raids all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1215">The military would come pouncing down on them because the military declared its intention to protect the German economy or to rebuild the German economy, and these <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> operations were, they felt, destructive of the economy.</sentence><sentence id="1216">I think that's subject to some doubt, but that's what they said.</sentence><sentence id="1217">But in any case, when the announcement was made that there would be an evacuation, there were great protests, and it took a long, long time for us to move these people out to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1218">Some attrition, some people went away to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, others emigrated.</sentence><sentence id="1219">Nevertheless, we were accused of using all of the terminology of the wartime period of deportations, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aus Zeslac</span> (?)</sentence><sentence id="1220">or whatever they used.</sentence><sentence id="1221">Just like, about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>, Jews were being forced, against their will, out of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1222"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span>, as I say, was a favored <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in that setting.</sentence><sentence id="1223">And ultimately, it was closed.</sentence><sentence id="1224">And I was then asked to take over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span>, which was one of the biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="1225">I think, well, it was designed for about 3,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="1226">There must have been more, I don't recall the figures, 4,000.</sentence><sentence id="1227">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span> was actually two or three <span class="BUILDING">installations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1228">One was about 30 miles south of <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1748">A: There was a tendency -- I want to say as background, in the very beginning, when the Americans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, they

a <span class="BUILDING">German jail</span>, and arrested by the German police, and tried under German law.</sentence><sentence id="1750">Well, it was an abuse of that.</sentence><sentence id="1751">There were a lot of hard feelings, as you can understand.</sentence><sentence id="1752">And there was violence, and German police did some things which were vicious, and protests were raised by various people, including the American Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="1753">And then a decision was taken, it was a</sentence><sentence id="1755">6 very important decision, that no Jew could be arrested by German police.</sentence><sentence id="1756">They had no power over Jews, except they could detain them until military police came by and got them.</sentence><sentence id="1757">And if Jews were sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, they were sentenced to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in stockades, a military term for <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>, where American soldiers were sentenced for various offenses.</sentence><sentence id="1758">They did their time in stockades, and when they were tried, they were tried in a <span class="BUILDING">military court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1759">We had two or three levels, it was a <span class="BUILDING">summary court</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1760">I mean, depending on the seriousness of the offense.</sentence><sentence id="1761">And there would be a military prosecutor and a military judge sitting in judgment on them.</sentence><sentence id="1762">And this protected them, insulated them.</sentence><sentence id="1763">This was for criminal acts, of course, smuggling mostly, <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, whatever, but also occasionally, for some more serious offenses.</sentence><sentence id="1764">But mostly, it was sort of a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> thing.</sentence><sentence id="1765">I was constantly running down their pleas.</sentence><sentence id="1766">You know, Joe or John, whatever the judge's name was, please think about this guy, what he had been through, and all of the rest.</sentence><sentence id="1767">It very frequently worked.</sentence><sentence id="1768">But then there were offenses of Jews, one Jew against another Jew, in the <span

internally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1773">And a kind of primitive justice system was set up.</sentence><sentence id="1774">And for want of a better one, I remember, I served for about a year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span>, I think, yeah, as a judge.</sentence><sentence id="1775">I would hold <span class="BUILDING">court</span> as a guy sitting there, listening to the evidence, and deciding whether to dismiss the case or get together and settle the thing, or whether there was some penalty.</sentence><sentence id="1776">I had no <span class="BUILDING">jail</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1777">[had no way of doing that, but the penalty was deprivation of some privilege or something.</sentence><sentence id="1778">But at least there would be a statement, a verdict, some finding.</sentence><sentence id="1779">And we also had a problem, I think I mentioned this, occasionally when a kapo would be found, or a ghettopolizei who was accused of cooperating with the Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, resulting in the suffering of Jews maybe the death of Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1780">After we pried him loose from an angry mob, all bloodied and I tell you, terrible, we would try to listen to what this man had to say for himself.</sentence><sentence id="1781">And he would try to produce witnesses.</sentence><sentence id="1782">Of course, there were accusers, people who found them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, and came and told how he extracted money from them in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2463">Q: Can you talk a little bit more about the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, both looked like a solution to a lot of problems, but I suspect it also generated its own problems?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2465">A: Terrible.</sentence><sentence id="2466">I think the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, more than anything else I can think of, generated hostility towards the Jewish community as it then existed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, among the military and among, I think, Germans, generally.</sentence><sentence id="2467">And the newspaper people would come over from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and want to know about "the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>"</sentence><sentence id="2469">4 because I think it was publicized here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, as well.</sentence><sentence id="2470">And we were very sensitive about it.</sentence><sentence id="2471"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was told that a number one priority of the occupation immediately after the end of the war was the reconstruction of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s economy, which was smashed.</sentence><sentence id="2472">And Eisenhower and the people that came after him, and in particular, John McCloy, General Clay, all made that a number one priority.</sentence><sentence id="2473">And therefore, the diversion of goods, of manufactured goods, and food from the regular <span class="BUILDING">market</span> was considered a very great threat to the economy.</sentence><sentence id="2474">And measures were to be taken against it, police measures.</sentence><sentence id="2475">At the same time, the people who were withholding these goods -- if you walked into a <span class="BUILDING">German shop</span>, <span class="BUILDING">camera store</span>, for example -- until the currency was reformed, that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> lay absolutely empty of any merchandise.</sentence><sentence id="2476">You couldn't buy food.</sentence><sentence id="2477">You couldn't buy clothing because the clothing had to be sold at regulated prices, and the mark, the reichsmark, which was still the old reich before the d-mark, was practically worthless.</sentence><sentence id="2478">I mean, it went to like 800 to a dollar at one point, so that the Germans would not sell their goods on the open <span class="BUILDING">market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2479">That is, on the regular <span class="BUILDING">market</span> under controlled prices, because they would be losing their shirts.</sentence><sentence id="2480">And it was only to be bought with hard currencies: dollars, or Swiss francs, or British pounds, or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2481">Now, for the Jews, the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> was the only place.</sentence><sentence id="2482">These were people who had come out of the most terrible conditions, in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, either <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> or in hiding, or in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> where there was nothing to eat.</sentence><sentence id="2483">And there was a thrust to rebuild themselves, to rebuild their families.</sentence><sentence id="2484">They were producing children, doing all of these things, and the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> became the only way in which they could meet that need.</sentence><sentence id="2485">And, also, to produce some income for them, so that when they went overseas to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in which they would settle, they would have a few dollars in their pockets.</sentence><sentence id="2486">And so this <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> developed.</sentence><sentence id="2487">It took the form very frequently of little <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span>, thriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.950617" long="11.301876">Feldafing</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neu Freimann</span> also.</sentence><sentence id="2488">You could buy most anything you needed or wanted.</sentence><sentence id="2489">Food, cloth for making clothing.</sentence><sentence id="2490">The joke was, you could get anything you want -- You couldn't get anything you want, but you could get a lot of things.</sentence><sentence id="2491">And it thrived.</sentence><sentence id="2492">Now, the military authorities knew about it, and they would launch raids on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to grab these people in the act.</sentence><sentence id="2493">And early in the morning, maybe about 5:00, 6:00, or 7:00 o'clock in the morning, they would surround the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armed vehicles</span>, and they would go marching in there looking for contraband: cigarettes, coffee, all kinds of things.</sentence><sentence id="2494">I remember a funny story about how this stuff got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foehrenwald</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2495">There's a big <span class="BUILDING">meat market</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2496">The question is, where do you get meat in a <span class="BUILDING">market</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2497">Now, we discovered the meat was gotten in this way: garbage was collected by <span class="BUILDING">German firms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2498">And they didn't use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, they used sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sledges</span>, which were dragged along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, no wheels, just like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleighs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2499">And they were pulled by two oxen; they would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with two oxen.</sentence><sentence id="2500">And then, the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sledge</span> would emerge with one ox.</sentence><sentence id="2501">Then for a few days, there would be meat, kosher meat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2502">But in any case, in the event of a raid in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> had to receive prior notice from the military.</sentence><sentence id="2503">No military people could enter a United Nations Displaced Persons Camp</sentence><sentence id="2505">5 without prior clearance from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span>, from the responsible United Nations official.</sentence><sentence id="2506">So, when any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> over which I had any kind of supervising relationships were about to be raided, I would receive a call from the colonel in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span> saying, "Mr. Sorrin, tomorrow morning at 7:00 o'clock, we are going to be entering your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2507">And of course, now, 40 or 50 years later, I am free to say it -- I would call up and tell Haim Yankel or the president of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> tomorrow is going to be a razzia, a raid.</sentence><sentence id="2508">You know, I could not abide these -- I mean, I was sympathetic with what the Jews were trying to do.</sentence><sentence id="2509">I had no participation in it, but I would just tell them, if you don't want to be raided, put your stuff out of sight.</sentence><sentence id="2510">And that thrived.</sentence><sentence id="2511">And I understood it.</sentence><sentence id="2512">And the military did not, from their vantage point, nor did the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> authorities.</sentence><sentence id="2513">They were simply obeying the mandate of the military government.</sentence><sentence id="2514">But without that, it would have been tragic for Jewish families.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2569">Q: What happened between Jews, because obviously, some people were more entrepreneurial and others were not so entrepreneurial?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2571">A: That's right.</sentence><sentence id="2572">Some people made a lot of money, but most people made a little money, enough to get along.</sentence><sentence id="2573">But we used to hear that some people made big deals.</sentence><sentence id="2574">Now, I want to also mention that very often, involved in these big deals were members of the armed forces themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2575">That is, some of the PX.</sentence><sentence id="2576">people who had access to cigarettes and coffee from the P.X. They didn't have to steal it.</sentence><sentence id="2577">It was charged out as purchased in some way, and it ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> operation.</sentence><sentence id="2578">And these <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> operations were not of course only Jewish -- everybody was participating in them because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was vulnerable, its economic system was vulnerable, because of the war, to that kind of activity.</sentence><sentence id="2579">What happened here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, if you went to go buy a camera, let's say, for $400, and each dollar is worth a tenth of what its value is, so that you're really buying it for $40 dollars, or maybe even $4 when the mark really went down, the people producing these cameras are going to take them off the shelves and wait for someone to come in with another currency.</sentence><sentence id="2580">But then a real act of genius occurred, a genius on the part of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and their economic planners.</sentence><sentence id="2581">When the war was over, the currency which was in use was reichsmarks.</sentence><sentence id="2582">And a lot of their currency had pictures of German emperors on them, whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2583">But some of them, many of them had Hitler and Goering and Goebbels and people like that.</sentence><sentence id="2584">That money was discarded.</sentence><sentence id="2585">But the other currency, the old currency was still in circulation, and it was subject to extraordinary fluctuation because of the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> situation.</sentence><sentence id="2586">Now, a decision was taken by the military government in connection with the finance leaders of <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> at the time -- Conrad Adenauer was the chancellor of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- to change the currency, to completely abandon the reichsmarks, and to substitute d-marks for them.</sentence><sentence id="2587">And this had to be done secretly, because if it got out, there would be all kinds of dislocations.</sentence><sentence id="2588">All kinds of things would happen if this was happening.</sentence><sentence id="2589">It was no secret, by the way.</sentence><sentence id="2590">You can't do something that massive without somebody</sentence><sentence id="2592">6 knowing.</sentence><sentence id="2593">But what happened was that for a couple of weeks before the day of the currency reform, which I think took place in "48, <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> goods disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="2594">You couldn't buy, because nobody knew what the price would be.</sentence><sentence id="2595">And the people were withholding it, waiting for the new currency to come on <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2596">And that was a period of enormous restlessness in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="2597">I guess it must have been out in the general society, but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, I could -- we could see the tension rising.</sentence><sentence id="2598">There were fights.</sentence><sentence id="2599">There was a small riot in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, I remember.</sentence><sentence id="2600">They had all kinds of problems, because you couldn't get anything to eat.</sentence><sentence id="2601">And people had to feed themselves and their families.</sentence><sentence id="2602">And then on a given day, an announcement was put up, broadcast through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, and the currency reform began.</sentence><sentence id="2603">Now, what they did was -- I am trying to remember -- everybody got, I think, 10 marks, or maybe it was 100 marks.</sentence><sentence id="2604">If you had 10 million dollars stashed in old currency, it was worthless to you.</sentence><sentence id="2605">You could just burn it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> because you got the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2606">Every individual got the same amount in d-marks.</sentence><sentence id="2607">And it was a miracle.</sentence><sentence id="2608">By the way, the Germans had a word for it, wirtschaft wunder, economic wonder, economic miracle.</sentence><sentence id="2609">Within days, the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> filled with merchandise, cameras, food, cakes, meat, cookies.</sentence><sentence id="2610">You could buy whatever you wanted, clothing, just in a matter of weeks, because the d-marks were around, and people suddenly had lots of d-marks, even though they were distributed in this democratic way.</sentence><sentence id="2611">And that began <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>'s real economic recovery, and changed entirely the nature of the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> -- it disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="2612">It was no longer a viable instrument, you know, for doing business in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2613">Before, during the days of the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, it was necessary.</sentence><sentence id="2614">Otherwise, you would not move anything.</sentence><sentence id="2615">So I remember that day.</sentence><sentence id="2616">We had to supervise.</sentence><sentence id="2617">We went <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>, saw people lined up.</sentence><sentence id="2618">And there were German treasury officials, handing out -- taking -- you had to bring a certain amount of reichsmarks.</sentence><sentence id="2619">There was an exchange for the old marks to the new marks, but you had a limited amount that you could get.</sentence><sentence id="2620">And I tell you, I remember, it was an absolute wonder.</sentence><sentence id="2621">And that was done by the American people, the American economists who were working over there, together with the Germans and the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2622">It changed the life of the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> at that time, very much so.</sentence><sentence id="2623">And the people living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> as well.</sentence></p></dialogue>
