id="1527">With the Germans we knew before that that is, we were expecting more or less a bad relation.</sentence><sentence id="1528">But the others with whom we grew up together.</sentence><sentence id="1529">So, that was terrible for me, and I -- certain time I worked inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as a helper of a craftsman in the internal fac -- it wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, but a <span class="INT_SPACE">workshop</span>, a <span class="INT_SPACE">workshop</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1530">So, he was a very old Ocarpenter, this man, and

not in the best 5 way.</sentence><sentence id="1533">Anyway, I worked beyond a <span class="DLF">roof</span>, it was winter so it was not so bad and it was warm there because we took the rest of the wood and put it the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1534">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, it was worse.</sentence><sentence id="1535">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we had no wood enough, so sometimes we could -- we took the <span class="DLF">fences</span> from around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and put this in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> or even <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnitures</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1536">After they were finished, so I prepared to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> all the time, what I can, and only to come in the afternoon, later afternoon, then to have my meal, what's the meal was usually a soup, each time a soup.</sentence><sentence id="1537">In this soup they took everything they could, my mother, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> it was pieces of bread, potatoes, some grasses, of course water, put together with a little salt and that was the dinner, so-called dinner.</sentence><sentence id="1538">After the dinner we went to other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to listen to songs.</sentence><sentence id="1539">Or in certain time, I began to take part in the meetings of a new stage of the underground, of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</sentence><sentence id="1540">It was not far from my <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and that was also a turning point for me.</sentence><sentence id="1541">The beginning we were talking of every kind of socialism, democratic socialism, or radical socialism, theoretical things, and what we have to do after the war and what is the best way to become democratic, or undemocratic, many theoretical things.</sentence><sentence id="1542">I remember that I prepared also a paper that say of one guy, Franz Oppenheimer (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1543">Franz Oppenheimer.</sentence><sentence id="1544">He was a sociologist.</sentence><sentence id="1545">So, I brought it and read it or talked it to my other friends, the of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and I remember I was shouting, "Yes I can see immediately that it's not -- it was anti-socialist, this man."</sentence><sentence id="1546">He was probably a social democrat or something so it was not good for Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair that they were still very left.</sentence><sentence id="1547">But one day or night, come to me one of the friends of the people there, Gita Poger, and she told me, "I would like to talk to you very secretly.</sentence><sentence id="1548">You know we are meeting here, we are talking about political theories.</sentence><sentence id="1549">That was good for before war, now we have to do something else.</sentence><sentence id="1550">What does it mean?</sentence><sentence id="1551">I will not say you but somebody will talk to you and you have to keep it very secretly.</sentence><sentence id="1552">Not to tell even not your father, not your mother, not your sister."</sentence><sentence id="1553">I promised.</sentence><sentence id="1554">Another time come to me somebody, it was her, and with another girl and she told me, "Now we there will be a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1555">I am the commander of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and you the both, the two, are members.</sentence><sentence id="1556">I will give you orders and you have to fullfill it and also not to -- even if you are thinking of another of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair is also involved in these things, you have not to talk with them about this."</sentence><sentence id="1557">So every time she come with new orders.</sentence><sentence id="1558">One day she come and demand that you have to bring her many empty bottles, and here and there and other things.</sentence><sentence id="1559">And what was the most dramatical thing that one day she comes with part of a rifle.</sentence><sentence id="1560">I don't know what it is in English, but it's the part of that -- the shooting part before you have to push it and pull it and everything.</sentence><sentence id="1561">I forgot the English name, because I was never a English soldier.</sentence><sentence id="1562">So it was -- and she brought it in an old newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="1563">It was very dangerous, you know, that if for a piece of jewelry, jewel, you could be arrested and shot, so that was even dangerous not only for me but for the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1564">That I remember till today and I am meeting her all the time and I remember, "You, you was my hero.</sentence><sentence id="1565">I was admiring you how you are doing this."</sentence><sentence id="1566">And bit by bit we also have lessons telling you how to shoot, only theoretical and topography and about first aid, how to give, and how to make estimations of distances and a little Judo and many things.</sentence><sentence id="1567">Until we heard that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno Ghetto</span> is liquidated and then we also had also newspapers written by hand that -- I remember that some of the words was the order of the U.P.O., the United Partisans Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, or the first proclamation or the other, it was 6 included in our newspaper.</sentence><sentence id="1568">So, it was very, very important for me, for us, to hear such things.</sentence><sentence id="1569">If they can do it, maybe we can do it also.</sentence><sentence id="1570">So, we were very encouraged from this.</sentence><sentence id="1571">You must understand that nobody know -- we were closed like in a <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1572">And here is something talking about, resistance, really resistance, not only to sing songs and encourage each other.</sentence><sentence id="1573">So, it was very important to us and didn't tell no to nobody.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1643">Q: I want you to say that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1645">A: The fact is that in the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, also in the organization and the most of the members were not males, but females, girls.</sentence><sentence id="1646">Yeah, girls, they were very young, so we can call them girls.</sentence><sentence id="1647">So, it was very natural that in such a <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> there was one man, if I am, I hope, with two girls.</sentence><sentence id="1648">And I didn't ask questions why.</sentence><sentence id="1649">It didn't matter me.</sentence><sentence id="1650">She's my major in this thing and I have very willingly to do all of this, her orders.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1663">Q: I'm wondering if the Jewish police in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> gave any assistance to your <span class="BUILDING">organizations</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1665">A: Yes, the Jewish police did it, but I don't remember in which <span class="NPIP">stage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1666">I know, but not -- I don't remember, those are two things.</sentence><sentence id="1667">It was at time for instance in 26th of October 1943, for me it was a critical day, because I lost my family this days.</sentence><sentence id="1668">It was deportation to <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1669">At that morning, I -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed.</sentence><sentence id="1670">Nobody went to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I got mission, a certain mission to go in another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, to say a parole, a certain parole, I think that I remember the parole, and they sent me again in another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1671">When they sent me, it was the beginning already of the deportation.</sentence><sentence id="1672">And when I passed my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were living, our <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>, I saw that a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> staying near the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and Jewish police and others, I don't remember who, maybe 7 Lithuanian, or Estonian, or German are coming to take my family.</sentence><sentence id="1673">I was passing very close let's say about ten, fifteen meters.</sentence><sentence id="1674">They have seen me, I have seen them.</sentence><sentence id="1675">My sister was very crying, very crying.</sentence><sentence id="1676">My father was saying, in a <span class="NPIP">position</span>, or in a stride, "Everything is lost."</sentence><sentence id="1677">He saw me and made such (gesturing).</sentence><sentence id="1678">He didn't say it, but, "What we can do?"</sentence><sentence id="1679">Only my mother she make me a strong wink with her eye.</sentence><sentence id="1680">It means, "Go away!"</sentence><sentence id="1681">and that was very, very important for me because yesterday the 26th of October was 51 years after this day, and I was thinking if she would not do it, maybe I would become again a good son and join the family where they are going.</sentence><sentence id="1682">Because I didn't expect that they will be taken, and why?</sentence><sentence id="1683">Because several days before, this my commander come to me and asking me, "I would like to know the names of your father, your mother, and your sister and others in your family and the name of the identity cards, number," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1684">Maybe she told me or I understood that the families of the underground people will be defended.</sentence><sentence id="1685">So, when I saw that also they are taking I was shocked.</sentence><sentence id="1686">I was shocked, shocked twice, so maybe this agreement that maybe was done with the Elderstrat, with the authorities through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, didn't work, or maybe another thing, so that's a puncture.</sentence><sentence id="1687">To think that my family they are taken so what makes the decision for me to go further, was this movement by the eye, a wink to the eye of my mother, that mother, Bluma Levin, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wigoda</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1688">She did it and it give me a motivation to go farther and even not to look back.</sentence><sentence id="1689">So, I went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> I have to go.</sentence><sentence id="1690">It was ina certain <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1691">It was called Blocktzai (ph), means Blocktzey (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1692">And there I had to say a certain parole. "</sentence><sentence id="1693">I want" -- the parole was, "I want to sleep here at night."</sentence><sentence id="1694">In Yiddish it (speaking Yiddish), so the answer was, I don't remember, but now I'm coming to the your main question, I put it already together that in this day -- before this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was staying a policeman, his name was Daniel Billard (ph).</sentence><sentence id="1695">He was a known policeman because before the war he was a very known box-man.</sentence><sentence id="1696">Maybe he asking me the question or another man, so then I realized that the police or at least a part of the police is working in cooperation with the -- with the underground.</sentence><sentence id="1697">That makes me also a good feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1698">And afterwards, I was told to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1699">I went -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1700">After I come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, they opened a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> -- no the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was with ashes or something or small stones.</sentence><sentence id="1701">So, somebody took away the stones and told me to, "Go there."</sentence><sentence id="1702">I fell.</sentence><sentence id="1703">I think that I fell.</sentence><sentence id="1704">So, I remember that some hands catched me and pulled me down and what it was dark, dark, very dark.</sentence><sentence id="1705">I can only fell --only see some fires of cigarettes.</sentence><sentence id="1706">Very in silence, every half an hour was an order, move here, move there, or who wants to eat, who wants to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1707">I don't know which -- I don't remember which arrangements they made.</sentence><sentence id="1708">Who wants to smoke, who wants drink.</sentence><sentence id="1709">One like with a chain.</sentence><sentence id="1710">I am telling them and he is telling the other and so on and so on and a certain moment we felt that a noise, anoise, and somebody knocking on the iron cover of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span>, "Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta," and people are calling and answering, maybe they are going to catch us and somebody telled them.</sentence><sentence id="1711">They are still looking for people for deportation because in this day, many were hiding with me, but we made it an organized form.</sentence><sentence id="1712">So, I felt myself better.</sentence><sentence id="1713">I don't remember if somebody had arms or not, but I felt so secure and so good that somebody is taking care on me.</sentence><sentence id="1714">And really, after a few minutes, everything settled maybe and silent again.</sentence><sentence id="1715">We were not -- I don't know because I don't remember if I looked of -- in my watch.</sentence><sentence id="1716">I have yet my watch.</sentence><sentence id="1717">My watch that I get -- I received as a bar mitzvah.</sentence><sentence id="1718">And when 8 we had to come out it was already evening.</sentence><sentence id="1719">In October the evening began early like now.</sentence><sentence id="1720">And we were told that now everybody is going for a while with family, "You are free but you have to come back very soon.</sentence><sentence id="1721">Maybe this night we are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1722">Leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, it means to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1723">I become again very happy.</sentence><sentence id="1724">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was empty without people, without my parents, without my sister, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1725">And I have seen that some -- the neighbors, next door neighbors of my family by the name of Feen (ph) they were very surprised to see me, "How come you back?"</sentence><sentence id="1726">because they were sure if my family was taken so also me.</sentence><sentence id="1727">And they gave me some to eat and to drink.</sentence><sentence id="1728">We were not in the best relations, but now we become very close.</sentence><sentence id="1729">But I realize that many things are not in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so maybe my family took it, or maybe they took it, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1730">But it was for me -- I didn't care because if I are leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> this night it's for me all the same, and I took some sandwiches they gave me.</sentence><sentence id="1731">I didn't tell them, but I told them that I will not more live here in this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1732">I'm going away.</sentence><sentence id="1733">Maybe they understood, maybe not.</sentence><sentence id="1734">And when I come back to the place of concentration, it was in another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stesbolyu</span> (ph) so we were told that this night nothing will happened and we have to stay.</sentence><sentence id="1735">We have to stay, so we decide to not to go more <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1736">Because what's <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1737"><span class="BUILDING">Home</span> without parents is no <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, or sister, no <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1738">So, I was not the only one who was in such a situation.</sentence><sentence id="1739">There were more, three, four, five, six.</sentence><sentence id="1740">I don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="1741">So, we stayed in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we sleep in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1742">We made arrangements to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="1743">It was not in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> but under a <span class="DLF">roof</span> of a small <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1744">So, it was <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for everybody and actually this was the beginning of a collective or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span>, if you want, of a part of a members of Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair and the others.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Collective or <span

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1997">Q: You can say parole or password, but I need you to begin by saying the policeman.</sentence><sentence id="1998">It's a full sentence.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2001">A: So, the policeman who were a very close to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> on their Block C or Block Tze (ph) as we called it, I knew him before.</sentence><sentence id="2002">I knew even his name.</sentence><sentence id="2003">His name was Daniel Billard (ph) and his question was (speaking Yiddish), it means, what do you need here?</sentence><sentence id="2004">I understood I knew it before that this is the beginning of a password, we called it parole.</sentence><sentence id="2005">So, the answer on this password, or the parole was, "We have -- we get here or we have here to sleep this night."</sentence><sentence id="2006">In Yiddish it sounds (speaking Yiddish) mir or I, I don't remember well, anyway to sleep here, so he was satisfied because this was the true parole and he let me in to come and maybe show me also the way to go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> or in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> that I don't remember very good but afterwards somebody opened a cover on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and they also to put away the stones that were under this cover and I felt that I am falling down, down, down, until several hands caught me and they bring me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to a certain <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2007">It was dark there, that what I remember.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2015">Q: The other question I have is, I assume there were also <span class="INT_SPACE">Communists cells</span> or other groups and I'm wondering if you -- the different groups worked together or if they had separate responsibilities in terms of helping people get supplies or get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2016">Do you know -- what did you know about that at the time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2019">A: At that time, we knew that we are not the only, that the other groups were organized.</sentence><sentence id="2020">We called them several names one name was the Communist or the Mushtas (ph), because of Joe Stalin.</sentence><sentence id="2021">Ofdevantzes (ph), or Coatkes (ph), Coatkes means short jackets, overjackets, coats, but short.</sentence><sentence id="2022">But we knew that they doesn't belong to us, they belong to the left-left and some of them we knew even before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2023">Some change their <span class="NPIP">places</span>, come from the Zionists to the Communists and why?</sentence><sentence id="2024">Because as we understood, they are more than we.</sentence><sentence id="2025">They are a lot.</sentence><sentence id="2026">And one of them it was very known his name was Chaim Yellin (ph).He was a very known figure even in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, even outside the organization.</sentence><sentence id="2027">We knew also or maybe we had the feeling that they has the best connections <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with the partisans and probably I was told, probably it was my feeling, but we knew that they are the prominent people in the organization or their organization is more important than ours in the terms of communication with <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2028">We knew the partisans can be only Soviet partisans because other partisans will not deal with us.</sentence><sentence id="2029">And if Soviet partisans, it's Communists, so again, so they felt themselves very strong in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> even to be a Communist in this time was very dangerous for the Germans and for the Lithuanians because several times they were looking after such people in order to arrest them and to 3 lull them.</sentence><sentence id="2030">But in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was like in autonomy everybody could -- it was like a big shelter in terms of politics.</sentence><sentence id="2031">So, they felt themselves very good and very secure.</sentence><sentence id="2032">Even more when we had to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, so it was a rumor between us that they are having a preference to go and also their girls, or girlfriends, or wives will get a better -- a better position, or they had not to wait so long as our girls.</sentence><sentence id="2033">And I will not forget one thing that one of our girls, were organized in Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzai, we were living this time already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communa</span>, in the collective, it was -- the name was Mildos (ph) 7, because the <span class="DLF">street</span> was Mildos and the number of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was 7.</sentence><sentence id="2034">So it was called Milda 7 everybody, not everybody, but many knew that that belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</sentence><sentence id="2035">The Communists have also their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not far from us and also ABC, Abetze (ph) Irgun L'Tzion (ph) has their <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2036">So, the developments of all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> was similar.</sentence><sentence id="2037">People were alone without parents, without families, decide to live together and it was also convenient for the organization.</sentence><sentence id="2038">Everybody can catch all his -- all their members at one time and they have control and they can also hide their arms and make training with arms, so it was good for everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2039">So, I'm coming back to one of our girls which belonged to Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, her name was Rosa, Rosa.</sentence><sentence id="2040">She was already taken to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in order to be included in a group -- I don't remember the number of the group -- going by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2041">She was taken away at the last moment, and instead her was put ina girl of the -- what we called them Communist and they are calling no or even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they have a cover name.</sentence><sentence id="2042">It was called Anti-Facists Fight Organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2043">So, they have a preference and when we come, I come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> I found a lot of people who belonged to their organizations and of -- from us were only I think eleven or twelve with one, only one girl.</sentence><sentence id="2044">For girls it was generally more difficult.</sentence><sentence id="2045">It's because the high command of the partisans is Ruditsky, or Rudniky for us, demand they give preference for men, male good who trained not with revolvers but with long rifles, long rifles mean long arms and better males than females.</sentence><sentence id="2046">The ghetto organization had another pressure to do what they demand.</sentence><sentence id="2047">So, it all the time were compromise, here, there.</sentence><sentence id="2048">Anyway, the last decision that - - the factor let's say, was that most of the girls, Jewish girls and these detachments, and I am talking about the detachments, Kovno detatchments in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruditsky Forest</span> which was called this to the German occupants that most of the girl did belong before to the Communist circles or what was called Anti-Facist Fighter Organizations, that is.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2086">A: The Zionist organizations, and I am talking mostly about their underground organizations because there were many organizations like parties, but they belong to more adult people, but talking about the youth movements, the Zionist youth movements of -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span>, we are talking about three main organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2087">It Irgun Brei Tzion (ph), 4 organization of bright young braves, any way now we would call them general Zionist.</sentence><sentence id="2088">It included also religious Zionists, liberal Zionists and so on, that's one.</sentence><sentence id="2089">The other was what I mentioned before Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair with the time where we coordinated with Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair, or Dror (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2090">It was more or less also ideological very close.</sentence><sentence id="2091">So they afterwards established the collective of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> together.</sentence><sentence id="2092">What I mentioned <span class="BUILDING">Mildos Sheva</span> (ph), <span class="BUILDING">Mildos 7</span> was together.</sentence><sentence id="2093">I would call it in one word the --as it means the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> of the Zionists.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2114">A: Continue, or come back to describe -- maybe it's too complicated what I'm talking about.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2116">Q: I think what you can is that the underground -- because I don't think people know this -- was really young people and that if you then kind of go and say the Zionist organizations maybe had better cooperation with the community, or I don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2118">A: Iam coming to this, but first of all, it's important to describe who they are, who they were.</sentence><sentence id="2119">So, we are talking about underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno Ghetto</span>, maybe also other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span>,we are talking mostly about young people.</sentence><sentence id="2120">Young people it means maybe from 15, 16 till 30.</sentence><sentence id="2121">If they were more,they were exeptions.</sentence><sentence id="2122">And I will tell you who were the Zionists.</sentence><sentence id="2123">They were divided into three or four groups.</sentence><sentence id="2124">They were the general Zionists and the organization was called Abetze, Irgun Brei Tzion (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2125">In this organization were also included some of religious Zionists, Bnei Akiva (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2126">After -- the other was Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and they with a time unified with the Dror or Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair.</sentence><sentence id="2127">It also left workers" organization.</sentence><sentence id="2128">They were very, very close ideologically, and they established the collective or the kibbutz called Mildos Sheva (ph), Mildos 7.</sentence><sentence id="2129"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sheva</span>, it means seven in Hebrew.</sentence><sentence id="2130">We used very much to talk Hebrew also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2131">Therefore I am mentioning sheva, so it's important; it reminds me.</sentence><sentence id="2132">The other group was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beitar</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2133">Beitar and other people were incorporated in this ideology that's three.</sentence><sentence id="2134">And probably we can also include to this organizations Brit Tzion (ph), were adult people let's say from 30 till 60 or more.</sentence><sentence id="2135">It was an organization who helped the Abetze, who were young people.</sentence><sentence id="2136">So, if talking about young people about the really underground organization who were prepared to do more or less everything then we are talking about organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2137">The ABC, Abetze, not ABC, Irgun Brei Tzion, Ha'Chalutz Ha'Tzair and Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair, and Beitar -- 5 they were very involved in the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because their establishment of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was also Zionist.</sentence><sentence id="2138">If you will take Dr. Elkous and his deputy of the Elderstrat, Leib Garfunkel (ph) and the others were former activists or top members or leaders of the Zionist organizations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="2139">So, it happen so also the staff of the Elderstrat in all of officer were sitting people more Zionists than all the others.</sentence><sentence id="2140">So that it was natural that they could help with many things their organization, the underground organization, with money, with means, with transportation, and what's most important, with covering them.</sentence><sentence id="2141">I mean, the police.</sentence><sentence id="2142">The Jewish Ghetto Police.</sentence><sentence id="2143">I remember that our organization, also we sent some of our members to be organized in the police in order that they can help us, they can tell us what is going and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2144">Even there was one, two, or four people who belong to the Communist organization who also sent to serve in the police, in the Jewish Police in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2145">Anyway, the partition of work became so, or it happened without our planning so our planning was the Zionist organization were more active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because they are close to the Elderstrat, they know many things they can get help on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2146">The Communist, the Anti-Facist Fight Organization they have very good connections with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, with the partisans, with the Communists <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2147">And so it was a very good combinations between the two big parts, contra parts of one big organization with that they should have one <span class="DLF">roof</span> in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was called, in a certain time it was called the MTC it means Military Technical Commission.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2262">A: After the 26th of October 1943 when we meet a big number of the organizations, not one, met together in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hideout</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">Block C</span> after we could make lights in the evening, so we saw many people I know one body, somebody knew me but we're from different organizations.</sentence><sentence id="2263">And from then, it was no more secrets.</sentence><sentence id="2264">We kept other secrets, where we were hiding, arms and so on and some but the belonging to the organization was no more secret.</sentence><sentence id="2265">Of course we kept many things, when we are going, and other things, and our <span class="NPIP">destination</span>, our direction, even we didn't know exactly, only the last two days we were kept in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and then we get the last instructions.</sentence><sentence id="2266">From there we could not go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2267">It wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> it was a kibbutz, no more, and then we were given, very secret things that if you are lost and you are alone what do you have to do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2274">Q: So, how did you get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2275">Try to remember and describe for me your escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2278">A: Oh, I will never forget it in my life, because I-- our coming out was postponed several 7 times and we become -- I would say, nervous or maybe it will not fulfilled because it was like a dream, like a dream, and a good dream.</sentence><sentence id="2279">So one or two or some hours we have to wait again and to come again.</sentence><sentence id="2280">I don't know what happened and why, but I trust the organization like it would be God, for a religious man.</sentence><sentence id="2281">So, it comes the moment when they call, "Okay, now you have to go to the <span class="DLF">tracks</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2282">They prepared us, I think, with numbers that not altogether will climb, and so it will not make disorder there.</sentence><sentence id="2283">So, on the <span class="DLF">track</span>, I saw two soldiers, German soldiers with uniform, maybe they belong to the police or Wehrmacht.</sentence><sentence id="2284">After a few minutes I realize these are two from our group, and they make like they would be our escorts.</sentence><sentence id="2285">So, I had really to admire organization.</sentence><sentence id="2286">If they are so clever, so sophisticated that they can prepare everything, so I hope it will be everything good.</sentence><sentence id="2287">And we heard that somebody's asking questions at the <span class="DLF">gate</span>, police or other and then at certain times electricity was short, closed in order to make that nobody can watch us and so on and somebody was asking, "Where are you going?"</sentence><sentence id="2288">so another voice answer, "Yes, these men are going to work in the brigade of Baptai (ph)," a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Jewish use to work there, hard work.</sentence><sentence id="2289">And we moved.</sentence><sentence id="2290">They all begin to walk and we felt more than happy, but in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> not far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was stopped.</sentence><sentence id="2291">What happened?</sentence><sentence id="2292">We have to be very quiet.</sentence><sentence id="2293">Not to questions or nothing, and what's important, not to take with us things that can make evidence that we were Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, other Jews.</sentence><sentence id="2294">For example, I have to leave the pictures from my family and from me of course, many things and not one word written in Yiddish.</sentence><sentence id="2295">If I would be religious so I could not take with me , no, nothing.</sentence><sentence id="2296">So I'm coming again when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped and we hear again voices, here and there, talking Lithuanian, talking Russian.</sentence><sentence id="2297">After a few moments somebody saw a big sack with -- that was about ten or fifteen rifles.</sentence><sentence id="2298">I don't remember how it was -- how I get one of them, but I did and by this moment or maybe before, we had a commander and a comissar, it was political commander.</sentence><sentence id="2299">No, I think the commander was one of the people who should be our guide to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, because he came several times there and here and he knows, and should know every stone on the <span class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2300">So, in certain moment he told us, "Now you are taking off your red stars and putting them in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span>," or maybe eating them -- I don't remember, and he told, "Now you are partisans."</sentence><sentence id="2301">We have guns.</sentence><sentence id="2302">We have maybe hiding in certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> because it also can be against us if somebody is coming to make a search, but maybe not because we have all our rifles and now we can now do something, we can defend ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="2303">So, we went very far about 40 or 50 miles and you have to stand up and then we have to stand in a <span class="DLF">line</span> and we were walking by foot.</sentence><sentence id="2304">To put our white shirt or lining, I don't know how to call it in English, big white things, we put it so they -- we could not be very easy watched because this <span class="REGION">area</span> was with snow and we went, and we went, and many miles and we had heavy packs with us.</sentence><sentence id="2305">We also have not private packs but things to take for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, for the bases, maybe a radio, maybe other things, maybe medicaments for the small <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that we had in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, maybe other things, maybe it calls for -- I don't remember but it was very heavy to go.</sentence><sentence id="2306">I remember some of the people collapsed on the way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2336">Q: How many were there with you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2340">A: Oh, we were a very big group, I think 28, and we have --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2342">Q: Men and women?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2344">A: Men and women and we have -- I remember everybody has a gun, two have machine guns, and one has an automatic rifle, that's called a sedete (ph) in the Russian terms.</sentence><sentence id="2345">Even the girls had guns, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2346">And also it was heavy to have the gun and the pack.</sentence><sentence id="2347">So, at night we come to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, and we were told that we have not to go in only one -- everybody in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> not in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> but in the side.</sentence><sentence id="2348">Excuse me, it was not -- it was at day.</sentence><sentence id="2349">At night we have to go, to go and to go and to go.</sentence><sentence id="2350">At day, we come to a certain <span class="BUILDING">house</span> like a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, let's call it <span class="DLF">farm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2351">So everybody come to this <span class="DLF">farm</span> we weren't allowed to leave.</sentence><sentence id="2352">Till the evening, we have collected about twenty people.</sentence><sentence id="2353">So it was a neighbor come to see his neighbor. "</sentence><sentence id="2354">You are very nice, you are our neighbor but you cannot leave."</sentence><sentence id="2355">You know, it is because he cannot go and tell the police, and others.</sentence><sentence id="2356">Nobody is leaving.</sentence><sentence id="2357">Afterwards come his wife to look after him.</sentence><sentence id="2358">What is he doing, my husband.</sentence><sentence id="2359">Maybe he's drinking or maybe other things, so she come also. "</sentence><sentence id="2360">You will stay with your husband."</sentence><sentence id="2361">Sometimes you saw kids, and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2362">As evening, a lot of people with us, and at this time some of us could relax and to sleep by a certain order.</sentence><sentence id="2363">Some were staying with the rifle and hand radio that everything can't happen.</sentence><sentence id="2364">And so we make it like two or three days until we come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2365">Yes, and before we come to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> we have to cross a very critical <span class="NPIP">point</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2366">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2367">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railways</span> were very watched by the Germans because it was a very strategic thing.</sentence><sentence id="2368">Anyway we have to make operation to send people here and there and to watch the Germans will not come here, and we did it.</sentence><sentence id="2369">After that we have to cross a <span class="DLF">highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2370">Also, more or less the same tactic and then we were told now we are in the <span class="REGION">partisan area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2371">Partisan area.</sentence><sentence id="2372">Also, we have to go with the arms, but you feel yourself to be more free, not be in tension so much more.</sentence><sentence id="2373">But, for me it was another tension.</sentence><sentence id="2374">If we are already in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kingdom</span> of the partisans, so it's the tension of be proud of, joy, to be glad, to be happy, you can use many words for this.</sentence><sentence id="2375">Sometimes I have seen signs on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span>, heavy <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamps</span> around them and sometimes we have to go on a very narrow <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> which was lying.</sentence><sentence id="2376">So, as it moved like in a story, or films that we have seen about the partisans after the October revolution in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and we have seen sometimes on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> signs red, or white, or together so I was sure that it's for us, somebody put this for us.</sentence><sentence id="2377">I was so trusting of the organizations, the partisans, not more of the organization of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2378">It was another authority for me.</sentence><sentence id="2379">So, I was very high there, like I was took drugs.</sentence><sentence id="2380">One moment we saw a man with a big, full hat, a Papacha (ph) it's called, of <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>, with an automatic arm and he told us a password, in Russian parole.</sentence><sentence id="2381">He didn't know, but our guys they knew, before they told him so he come smiling to us, "You're partisans," and he shook hands with everybody.</sentence><sentence id="2382">But we have to go farther and farther, and we were exhausted, especially the girls and we have also weak people.</sentence><sentence id="2383">Some people are very strong <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but here it was a hero who can make the way can also be a .</sentence><sentence id="2384">Until we come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2385">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">bases</span> also we have to pass a guard but this guard was already one that we know from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, our man.</sentence><sentence id="2386">Now also, we were kissing everybody and he had to leave us and to told that the group came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2387">He himself could let us come <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2388">He did it, 9 he went, and the other was watching us, it must be.</sentence><sentence id="2389">And afterward come the commander of the attachment and invited us all with greetings, "Now you can come in, you can come."</sentence><sentence id="2390">And that was a big celebration.</sentence><sentence id="2391">Everybody was asking me what happened with my uncle, with my girlfriend, and so on, the other thing, "Have you tobacco?"</sentence><sentence id="2392">or maybe it was the first question.</sentence><sentence id="2393">I was very large and everybody I gave my tobacco so tomorrow I have nothing to smoke for myself.</sentence><sentence id="2394">But it was a very, very, very happy meeting, until its come to a finish and everybody has another friend to ask look we have other music it's not so nice, it's very hard to be a partisan and that already perished and that were already taken as prisoner of war by Germans and we knew what it means to be in prisoners a German, and partisan, and even a Jew, and that sometimes there are anti-Semitic incidents even between the partisans and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2395">But we were talking half the night until we asleep.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2448">Q: Now, when you met with these other people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, were they all Jews, were they Soviet partisans?</sentence><sentence id="2449">I'm wondering who these other people were.</sentence><sentence id="2450">Were they all part of your <span class="BUILDING">organization</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2454">A This time, and we are talking about March, 1944, and detachments of to the occupants in Russian it's so it can be translated "Death to the occupants or the conquerors," in English.</sentence><sentence id="2455">So, it was a mixed unit from two or five or three paratroopers, they were the nucleus of this detachment.</sentence><sentence id="2456">Lithuanian, or Russian, people before Communists and they were parachuted into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> in order to establish this detachment.</sentence><sentence id="2457">A big part were former prisoner of wars, Russian, who escaped from their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, P.O.W. camps.</sentence><sentence id="2458">And a big part, I think in the beginning the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> made about 60, if not more percent, coming more and more and more till a day what from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> nobody could no more join us for internal things that happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so this turning point afterward we become less and less and less.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2465">Q: And you said there were incidents of anti-Semitism, even with the partisans?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2505">Q: I'm sorry I want to hear a whole sentence, so say I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2507">A: I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, or better, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rudniky Forest</span>, as partisan till July 1944, the 9th of July we heard the thunder of the big guns, the artillery, the Katusha of the Red Army, or the Soviet Army, so we knew that -- and we knew also from other sources from radio or so, that the Red Army or the Soviet Army is coming back to this <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2508">So, we were told also we will go like to help the big army to help them to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> was very close to us about 20 miles or so.</sentence><sentence id="2509">But then happened a certain event that was for us, for me personally, very important.</sentence><sentence id="2510">The 9th of July early in the morning come to us a girl partisan from the <span class="BUILDING">Wilno detachment</span> which were located not far.</sentence><sentence id="2511">We were all the time, we had, I would say, unlegal relations.</sentence><sentence id="2512">She was also from Ha'Shomer Ha'Tzair.</sentence><sentence id="2513">She was sent by Abba Kovner (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2514">Abba Kovner was the

"You have to go now as we are doing, you will come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, but when you come, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, please don't leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2517">You will be in a new organization with the aim of to go immediately by all means we can to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2518">And we were -- it was very logical for us and it was not big surprise and we left the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> and then was the beginning of a new organization.</sentence><sentence id="2519">Afterwards, this organization gets the name Bricha (ph), it means escaping.</sentence><sentence id="2520">And I was working for the archives of the internal ministry of Soviet Union, it's called Ainkavede (ph), yes.</sentence><sentence id="2521">I was very proud that they took me.</sentence><sentence id="2522">They took me because I knew several languages and I was intelligent.</sentence><sentence id="2523">So, I attended <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, so they took me, and I was working there.</sentence><sentence id="2524">One of my jobs was to make use from the material the Germans left, papers.</sentence><sentence id="2525">And I did it with pleasure because I found them very interesting material, even some reports from the Germans made on our activity of my detachments.</sentence><sentence id="2526">We also found list of names of Lithuanian soldiers and policemen who took part in killing Jewish people, so I was again very happy that I can do some important thing.</sentence><sentence id="2527">But at the same time, we were building another unlegal organization to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2528">And one of this was to prepare false documents to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> or by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> -- not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> but by <span class="DLF">tracks</span> or by foot or by any means to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chernovtsy</span>, it means in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucovina</span> in the south, southwest of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2529">From there to smuggle the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and there we were told maybe that we can find a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2530">That's close enough.</sentence><sentence id="2531">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>, or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucuresti</span> was about 1,000 kilometers, it's 900 miles.</sentence><sentence id="2532">So, we did it bit by bit man after man.</sentence><sentence id="2533">I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, I left my job, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span>, I left my arms, with a

our daughter.</sentence><sentence id="2535">It makes less dangerous for us.</sentence><sentence id="2536">We get also a card, how to go from which <span class="NPIP">place</span> to which <span class="NPIP">place</span>, to whom to apply and what will be our passports.</sentence><sentence id="2537">And we did it.</sentence><sentence id="2538">And for instance, I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.678235" long="25.284168">Wilno</span> I think the 19th of January 1945.</sentence><sentence id="2539">It means a 2 half year after I left the <span

long="25.284168">Wilno</span> was for me more neutral, for me personally, and the other thing that we were told also not to go far because if somebody needed us and I had the opportunity to go and our
