<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="19">Q: Will you tell me, Regina, what happened to you, please, when the Nazis came in to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="22">When the Nazis came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span>, we were still on this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="23">It was name <span class="BUILDING">Wisniowa Gora</span>, and we decided that we going to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="24">When we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was taken away by the Nazis, so we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a brother of ours, of my oldest brother, Rubin (ph), who at that time was in the Polish army fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and his wife and a six-month old baby was with us.</sentence><sentence id="25">And after that we stayed with my brother in my brother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, and I'm not going to say how it happened that my brother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the army and he took his wife and a six-month old baby and he said he wants to go to <span class="REGION">Soviet Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="26">That's the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> he said where the Jews could survive, and he went.</sentence><sentence id="27">My father, my mother, my sister and one brother, sister younger one, a brother older one than me that were staying in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until March 1940, 10th of March 1940 when the Gestapo came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="28">We thought that we're going to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="29">They already made it for the Jews, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="30">They took everyday from certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">The fact that my mother had a sis...a brother in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he said uh bring every...all the stuff here because when you're going to go, all you can do take is a valise.</sentence><sentence id="32">This way bring over stuff to me and when you come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you'll have everything.</sentence><sentence id="33">So that's what we did.</sentence><sentence id="34">When the the Nazis came in to take us down...it was during the night...one o'clock at night...my mother forget that she went down in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> shoes.</sentence><sentence id="35">And we went down...we thought we're going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="36">And we said alright.</sentence><sentence id="37">We're going to have everything over there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="38">For us the soldier said wouldn't you let me go back.</sentence><sentence id="39">My mother is cold and she would like to have some shoes.</sentence><sentence id="40">He said oh, it's going to be soon summer.</sentence><sentence id="41">You can go barefoot.</sentence><sentence id="42">She can go barefooted.</sentence><sentence id="43">So instead to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, they took us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they told us that we're going to be going out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="44">They took away our money, our possessions.</sentence><sentence id="45">They took off a ring from my mother...she had a fat finger...and they couldn't take it off...with the flesh and they sent us to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowo Radomsko</span> and they put us in a burned <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Radomsko</span> was " maiden name bombarded very, very badly and they had already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> over there.</sentence><sentence id="47">But I must say the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, especial there was a man named Burger (ph)...he was the oldest from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he brought some food special for the children.</sentence><sentence id="48">I still have my little sister...was a still a small little girl and uh I always....1 younger...I always looked older, and my mother said, well, we have to do something to make something to eat.</sentence><sentence id="49">What we going to do?</sentence><sentence id="50">My mother was washing <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> for people, because my father got ill right away when...he was a very delicate man, long, very tall, and uh from the nature he was not...my mother was the stronger one, for everything for father, and he...from the beginning he said right away I don't want to live.</sentence><sentence id="51">I cannot live like this, and I don't want to live.</sentence><sentence id="52">From mine...seven children I brought up, from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, for everything what I worked, I'm here in a burnt <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and strolling and a (indecipherable), and on the top of it, his foot got very swollen and very ill.</sentence><sentence id="53">So we decided that...there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> and in the <span class="BUILDING">Polish hospital</span>, Jews were not allowed.</sentence><sentence id="54">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span>, so we hired a Polish (indecipherable)...a Polish...that was a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span>.</sentence><sentence id="55">Called in a Polish (indecipherable), a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and we... took my father and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> and there we arrived in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="56">That's the time that I came...the first time in my life to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="57">My mother was behind in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with my sister and my brother and I decided...my father was out out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>...how...where is he going to go back to that burnt <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, so I was looking around a way to to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">I had 50 Polish zloty...what the Germans give...1 took away...we...our Polish...our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> belonged to the 3rd Reich, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.783" long="19.467">Litzmannstadt</span> they called it.</sentence><sentence id="59">So L..and that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> was Protectorate for us for that's where they give us the Polish money, so with that money I rented an apar...uh a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> by a family, and I brought over my sister and my brother and my mother so we stayed together.</sentence><sentence id="60">In 1942 I said I'm going to make a brief...before Yom Kippur, and that's the first time of our life that comes this kind of a holiday.</sentence><sentence id="61">The saddest time of my life.</sentence><sentence id="62">I guess all the lives from Czestochowa Jews, and maybe for other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>, that was a day that their Gestapo came and they took out the people for the liquidations.</sentence><sentence id="63">They call it the akti...the aktions.</sentence><sentence id="64">I don't know how it is...akt...aktion... aktion in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="65">And before that all it was the holidays and they took out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and made another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, so we did not have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="66">We were the refugees so we didn't know so many Czestochowans, people...so many...you know, that protects you, how you say, that we should get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="67">So the (indecipherable) rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.066666" long="19.45">Radomsko</span> invited my father with his family for the holidays, and I was left behind to wait for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, so they went and I was left behind.</sentence><sentence id="68">I stayed there for a little while and I said no...1 am going also going there, so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.066666" long="19.45">Radomsko</span>, just for a few days.</sentence><sentence id="69">Stayed with them and then I decided since I don't look so Jewish, I am going to go back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, bought a ticket, and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> to wait for the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="70">In meantime in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.066666" long="19.45">Radomsko</span> was judenrein...you know what that means, jJudenrein.</sentence><sentence id="71">Clean of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="72">Only a few I think were left behind because two of them came back, two sisters.</sentence><sentence id="73">They came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> later on, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="74">They were hid in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span>.</sentence><sentence id="75">And I stayed there...1 met a fellow in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> while my father was laying there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, and he took me into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span>...he had a father and a mother and a sister, but the mother said it's not nice that a girl should stay in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, with a fellow, so they decided that I should get married to him.</sentence><sentence id="76">He was much older than I was.</sentence><sentence id="77">He was fifteen years older.</sentence><sentence id="78">I got married by myself, and I even...somebody borrowed me a little veil and a dress and I got married, and if you don't want to have children, then you have them sometimes, and I become pregnant.</sentence><sentence id="79">I called up my mother and I told her about it.</sentence><sentence id="80">It was May 15, 1942.</sentence><sentence id="81">And I told her, and she said I'm sorry.</sentence><sentence id="82">I would like to come, but I can't because we....they were not allowed, the Jewish people, to travel and that was the last time I spoke to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="83">I spoke to her by telephone through the Jewish komitet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nowo Radomsko</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">Now after that, my husband was working in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>, in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span>, so he took me into that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span>.</sentence><sentence id="85">His parents were sent away with the whole family, sisters, two sisters and a niece and his parents, and we stayed behind.</sentence><sentence id="86">After that we were...I was washing the bloody wash from the people.</sentence><sentence id="87">I didn't know what else to do but I wanted to help.</sentence><sentence id="88">They left us for the next ones to go.</sentence><sentence id="89">After that they send us to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="90">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was named <span class="BUILDING">Factory Iskovitch</span> (ph), and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>...I don't know the name...where my husband was near the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">All of a sudden when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>...I hadn't mentioned his name.</sentence><sentence id="92">His name was Shlomo Muskovitch (ph).</sentence><sentence id="93">And somebody say hey, Muskovitch (ph) is <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, and I looked it out and I saw him taking his rucksack and his head down...he didn't see me.</sentence><sentence id="94">I saw him through the <span class="DLF">window</span>, and that's the last time I saw him.</sentence><sentence id="95">They were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> because they needed another hundred men for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, so this they sent him away.</sentence><sentence id="96">And here I came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>...they sent us to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and pregnant, alone, not from a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, without any family, without nobody.</sentence><sentence id="97">So everybody was making groups to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">It was <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in the ho...in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">That's what they give us...a few <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and uh I was sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on my rucksack and my things...I took a few things because I was thinking we weren't going to have some <span class="NPIP">place</span> the baby.</sentence><sentence id="100">In fact the doctor wanted to make an abortion right away.</sentence><sentence id="101">And I said what, my father would...he was a religious man.</sentence><sentence id="102">That would be the worst thing that anybody could have done.</sentence><sentence id="103">It's a sin.</sentence><sentence id="104">So I didn't want to do it.</sentence><sentence id="105">But by the time we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, by the time think it was late...so we were in...eight people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was a wo...a lady...at that time to me she was an older lady.</sentence><sentence id="106">Maybe she was forty-five years old and she had a daughter my age and she said, believe me, Regina, you'll see...make an abortion.</sentence><sentence id="107">Otherwise you're not going to live because she said you're young.</sentence><sentence id="108">You'll get married again.</sentence><sentence id="109">You'll have children.</sentence><sentence id="110">And I went to one doctor to make an abortion.</sentence><sentence id="111">He he wouldn't do it.</sentence><sentence id="112">He thought it's too late.</sentence><sentence id="113">Then we went to another doctor.</sentence><sentence id="114">I even remember her name...her name was Dr. Grunwald (ph), a woman doctor.</sentence><sentence id="115">In middle of abortion, she said I think you're going to die...the head is so big.</sentence><sentence id="116">You are very far...you must be having the fifth month already.</sentence><sentence id="117">I said yes I am.</sentence><sentence id="118">She said why I didn't ask you any questions.</sentence><sentence id="119">She said I've assumed that you're in the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="120">I didn't...I didn't show so much.</sentence><sentence id="121">I'm I'm tall, so I didn't show so much.</sentence><sentence id="122">I said no, I I...you didn't ask me what it is.</sentence><sentence id="123">And she said well...and the abortion was made on a small, tiny <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>, holding my own legs because there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or anything, and of course we they didn't want to wait any longer because it was pretty late and I listened to that older lady, what she said.</sentence><sentence id="124">She said if you don't go and make an abortion now, a little bit soon it's going to show and then they're going to send you away for the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">We want you to live, and that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="126">I had an abortion and I was...after that had to go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>, bleeding, and go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> and I was working and uh after one year they made another <span

the men, and married couples where they also had a <span class="DLF">street</span>, so there were three <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">Everything in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="130">We were going out to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">What happened...a lot of things what with my husband even said I was listening there about uh that uh Vislovich (ph) that they killed him laying right before my feet.</sentence><sentence

prepared to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> like every day and all of a sudden and to this day I don't know how that happened...all of a sudden we looked around by the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of going out from that HASAG, from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>...it took us an hour to walk to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">All of a sudden thousands of Ukrainians with their machine guns to us and from where they come from until this day I don't know how that happened so quick and they said, halt.</sentence><sentence id="139">And a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was put up and at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> went up a man...he was some kind of director from that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and he said...this this was exactly his words, because I was there: "In eure gewesenem Lager geht ihr nie mehr
