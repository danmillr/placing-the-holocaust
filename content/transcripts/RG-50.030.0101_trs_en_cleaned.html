<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="8">Q: Tell me a little bit about your, about your friends, growing up?</sentence><sentence id="9">What was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like?</sentence><sentence id="10">What kind of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> did you go to?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="14">A: I have attended a number of different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, probably because my mother and father were looking at what was the best educational outlet rather than a particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> uh which I didn't like terribly much.</sentence><sentence id="16">and them my sister and I spent about a year or two in <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="17">There were only five or six children and we had, strangely enough for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time, uh Hebrew instructions.</sentence><sentence id="18">But there was an excellent <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and then after that I attended a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> (ph) and my formal education per se actually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="24">Q: What about friends?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="26">A: Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph).</sentence><sentence id="27">She was a champion - champion skater, champion swimmer.</sentence><sentence id="28">She was very musical - played a number of instruments.</sentence><sentence id="29">I was given piano lessons, ballet lessons.</sentence><sentence id="30">I was particularly interested in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span>.</sentence><sentence id="31">And during the Russian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and recognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage.</sentence><sentence id="32">So they said to my parents, we're not interested in how well she will do academically.</sentence><sentence id="33">We have discovered that she has a very lovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are going to overlook her theatrical career.</sentence><sentence id="34">And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the major <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">choirs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="35">I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="36">It was just a natural <span class="DLF">outlet</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="37">Uh I played with a lot of my friends.</sentence><sentence id="38">We would invent some wonderful plays.</sentence><sentence id="39">It wasn't a store-bought toy.</sentence><sentence id="40">We would play <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">We would play uh I remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a lot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would be Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes from our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that.</sentence><sentence id="42">So we really had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti- Semitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed, blonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>, that my parents did, that I was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="43">But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept asking why, what's what what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="44">It's very hard for parents to explain because we believe in a different religion or we belong to a to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> rather than a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that people don't like you.</sentence><sentence id="45">And so I grew up both on one <span class="NPIP">level</span> uh happily because I was loved and protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family life was very important and | imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted embedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself, probably helped me a great deal later on to have that base, that strength of knowing who you are.</sentence><sentence id="46">Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that.</sentence><sentence id="47">And so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="48">We lived ina perfectly beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Niemen</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="49">Uh my mother was more religious than my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic about it.</sentence><sentence id="50">And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I started to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our <span class="DLF">windows</span> towards 1938, 1939, and uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and my father would, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to go to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children were told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder.</sentence><sentence id="51">And it was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend.</sentence><sentence id="52">But that's the kink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the catastrophe of the Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="53">So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it in terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and a lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already lingering in the in the background.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="82">Q: When did this change?</sentence><sentence id="83">When the Russians came, what else happened to you, to your life in addition to the special <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="84">Were there any other changes from "39 to "41 that you noticed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="88">A: Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political uh politics per se, I loved being there at that time because the pogroms have stopped.</sentence><sentence id="89">I was indited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group.</sentence><sentence id="90">They showered a great deal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them.</sentence><sentence id="91">My parents probably were dismayed and couldn't do anything about that.</sentence><sentence id="92">My father I believe was imprisoned for about three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know why, but it was obviously for political reasons.</sentence><sentence id="93">He may have said something that did not please the Communist in.. uh people.</sentence><sentence id="94">Now you have to understand <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> is about, I'm not sure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the <span class="DLF">Lithuanian border</span>, or maybe less.</sentence><sentence id="95">So that entire <span class="REGION">area</span> uh was a changeable <span class="REGION">area</span> geographically.</sentence><sentence id="96">It was first, my parents were born there or close by and then it was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="97">When I was born it <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, and in 1944 it was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> again, and it is <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="98">So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939.</sentence><sentence id="99">I speak <span class="COUNTRY">Poli</span>... spoke Polish.</sentence><sentence id="100">We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good.</sentence><sentence id="101">We spoke basically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and I would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other.</sentence><sentence id="102">And of course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages.</sentence><sentence id="103">Well, uh <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, the Soviet Union occupied that part of, well, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939 as we know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided.</sentence><sentence id="104">Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional <span class="REGION">northeastern part</span> went to the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="105">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balystok</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> and that entire <span class="REGION">areas</span> became Russian.</sentence><sentence id="106">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="107">I loved it.</sentence><sentence id="108">I learned White Russian because that is really Bieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics.</sentence><sentence id="109">My sister was the one who really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and dancing and they encouraged that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="110">And life seemed perfectly alright.</sentence><sentence id="111">And then in September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the bonders because the air the air raids were pretty severe.</sentence><sentence id="112">And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked up out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> and said we've just seen <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">Now again, you have to understand I did not understand the idea what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span>, what kind of ominous clouds that would sweep around Europe and what it would mean, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> are in front of your <span class="DLF">door</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: What did you do when you heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span>, when your family heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="142">What did you and your family do?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="143">A: They were very frightened.</sentence><sentence id="144">They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible stories coming out from the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, people who may, who escaped uh what was happening to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">But again I must say that maybe because I was playing with dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in, what the tragedy of the entire period meant.</sentence><sentence id="146">I could only reflect today as I have post- Holocaust.</sentence><sentence id="147">When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="148">I was we were ina <span class="DLF">vacuum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="149">I was in a vacuum.</sentence><sentence id="150">I can only speak for myself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: That's what we want to talk about, of course, is what you did and thought then rather than now.</sentence><sentence id="160">Then what did you do?</sentence><sentence id="161">Did <span class="BUILDING">school</span> continue for example?</sentence></p></dialogue>

I don't know what go what went on with the with the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where they the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> - as I said we were in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> - they probably started to, in fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942.</sentence><sentence id="252">No doubt that the Jews who were in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had already been evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="253">But this is the <span class="REGION">eastern part</span> and they you know they had to start a whole new program.</sentence><sentence id="254">Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="255">Uh they rounded us up.</sentence><sentence id="256">We had no idea why.</sentence><sentence id="257">I had no idea why.</sentence><sentence id="258">Maybe the others did.</sentence><sentence id="259">My parents and I, my sister and I and my parents were separated.</sentence><sentence id="260">My sister and I were taken to, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto number one</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">We had no idea what happened to our parents.</sentence><sentence id="262">I had subsequently learned that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, that was, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they were in a way entered the camp as most of them of course did not.</sentence><sentence id="263">My sister and I remained in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">That was already very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="265">It was it was wintertime.</sentence><sentence id="266">The selections were, in other words the evacuation process began quite earnestly.</sentence><sentence id="267">We work in a in a <span class="BUILDING">tobacco factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">My sister and I would share a kind of little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and ____ the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we managed to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec..-uh not selections because they weren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to wherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape.</sentence><sentence id="269">And we continued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave here and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again.</sentence><sentence id="270">But, on January probably the 18th or 20th, somewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide.</sentence><sentence id="271">We were found and walked to the to the to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and what was so dreadful and I remember that - I did not see Shoah but the told me about that.</sentence><sentence id="272">The people were standing and watching as the people, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously dragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">And then we saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="274">And that's when the reality set in but I still had no idea that a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> existed.</sentence><sentence id="275">That they were still doing the actually burning people.</sentence><sentence id="276">We didn't know that.</sentence><sentence id="277">My sister gave me my mother's coat.</sentence><sentence id="278">A long coat, and I think that coat may have been responsible for my going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> rather than to the <span class="BUILDING">crematory</span> right away.</sentence><sentence id="279">My sister was very bright.</sentence><sentence id="280">She was very cleaver.</sentence><sentence id="281">She was absolutely wonderful, tremendously liked.</sentence><sentence id="282">Her name was Sala (ph) and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was probably one of the worst things that I can possibly remember.</sentence><sentence id="283">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride was utterly horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="284">People died.</sentence><sentence id="285">There was no water.</sentence><sentence id="286">There were no sanitary facilities.</sentence><sentence id="287">There was no food.</sentence><sentence id="288">Whatever was had gone very quickly.</sentence><sentence id="289">It was about three and a half days.</sentence><sentence id="290">And then we stopped and we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="291">And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents.</sentence><sentence id="292">Well, we were right to some extent, except that we didn't meet them.</sentence><sentence id="293">During the time that we were that we came down, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, Sala said to me, don't speak, don't move, let me think for a moment.</sentence><sentence id="294">We were about twenty-five hundred people.</sentence><sentence id="295">I have a book by the way, from somebody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> who had just published the entire history of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="53.6484728" long="23.7588014">Grodno</span> and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is mentioned there, so that I learned something about -
