<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1346">A: As I see it, and it -- and you can say eventually it is subjective because of -- of my own immersion in this -- in this whole <span

and properly researched and -- and examined, and that is what were the particular forces and elements in the -- in the lil -- late 1930's and the early 1940's that -- that made it possible for organized world Jewry, and I use -- I say organized because unless -- unless something is organized, unless there is some sort of an instrumentality, then it is a lot of conversation.</sentence><sentence id="1348">Maybe conversation is important, yo-you -- you may not come to the -- to the action before -- be-before you -- before you -- you -- you contemplate the problem, but nonetheless, for the first time -- and I'm not a professional historian, so I say it with all these caveats and reservations, but I think it's the first time where the organized Jewish community in this global sense has -- has decided, in response to -- to in- incredible tragedy that has befallen the Jewish people, to -- to confront the perpetrators or -- or their successors.</sentence><sentence id="1349">Because if I go back, at least to the extent which -- and I have spent obviously, time going back to -- to periods of -- of disaster and catastrophe in Jewish

class="REGION">area</span> where the Crusaders and so on persecuted them.</sentence><sentence id="1355">Fortunately the kings of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> wanted -- needed craftsmen, and that in -- created an open <span class="DLF">door</span>, and the Jews were moved from the <span class="REGION">Rhine area</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, etcetera and a new chapter

-- and then subsequently came all kinds of -- forms of persecution, some of them -- obviously 1492 in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>, and again the Jews ran and left everything behind and build

century, with the pogroms of [indecipherable] and what was the response there?</sentence><sentence id="1362">The massive migration out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to -- to -- to the <span

sure.</sentence><sentence id="1377">The one thing that comes to mind for instance was the -- was the Armenian -- the persecution of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915, the World War I.

what it carried with it when -- when it began en masse to -- to leave.</sentence><sentence id="1389">What is connected with it, of course, I mean I -- I'm drifting, but I'll get back on the main <span class="DLF">track</span>, is also where were the fi -- where were the -- the failings?</sentence><sentence id="1390">The failings being did the organized Jewish world after 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third Reich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were leading?</sentence><sentence id="1391">After all, of the 600,000 German Jews, 300,000 remain in <span
