<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="110">Q: What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="112">A: We went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="113">Under Czechoslovakian government every...all children went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="114">However, let's say <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and things, that was percentages for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="115">The numerus clausus.</sentence><sentence id="116">Not all Jews could go because there was only certain percentage that could go...even under the democratic Czechoslovakians it existed.</sentence><sentence id="117">So we all, all of us children did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">public school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="118">01:06: We were mixed with Christian children, but there was never closeness with the Christian children and our Jewish children in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="119">There was a beautiful <span class="DLF">park</span> that we used to go to because it was <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and <span class="INT_SPACE">salt baths</span>, you know, for health purposes they had <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span>.</sentence><sentence id="120">They had beautiful <span class="DLF">parks</span> where we went sometimes to listen to music, but not always did we dare go because there were always bad times for Jews.</sentence><sentence id="121">I do remember as a young girl the Czechoslovakians had a <span class="BUILDING">sport complex</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokol</span> and they played tennis there and I just drooled.</sentence><sentence id="122">I wanted to play so terribly, and naturally I wouldn't have been accepted and we don't even try.</sentence><sentence id="123">I'm making up for it now.</sentence><sentence id="124">Again my father knew many Czechoslovakians because he worked with them and the only intermingled my father used to go in once in a while in the <span class="BUILDING">billiard clubs</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">At the time they played billiards, and he used to know a lot of people.</sentence><sentence id="126">I remember one...my parent's anniversary was on Purim, the holiday, and he got drunk once a little and he ran into the mayor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we ran after him.</sentence><sentence id="127">We were kids.</sentence><sentence id="128">We didn't want him to because we were afraid, but he said, what is it you want from us Jews?</sentence><sentence id="129">What did we do to you?</sentence><sentence id="130">That was one occasion that sticks in my mind, but he was kind of a little fighter, my father, and that is how we lived until 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="151">Q: What happened in "38?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="153">A: In 1938...I don't know the dates or so...but the Czechs left.</sentence><sentence id="154">I remember they had colonies of beautiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, the Czechoslovakian people, up on the upper part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they left and the Ukrainians took over and I remember it only because we had to change <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="155">I mean the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the same, but the language we had to change.</sentence><sentence id="156">We studied up till now in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> Czech, and we had some good teachers, some not so good teachers, like every <span class="NPIP">place</span> else I would say.</sentence><sentence id="157">Now the __ were the Ukrainian fasc...uh fascists, like the SS the German, the _ the Hungarian, the ___ was the Ukrainian uh fascist organization, but in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we started learning the alphabet.</sentence><sentence id="158">That's what Ukrainian use.</sentence><sentence id="159">We learned their anthem, their national anthem, , which J still remember, and uh but they...Ukrainian hated the Jews more than the Czechoslovaks.</sentence><sentence id="160">There was lots of fear and panic and sometimes they picked up some men and we never saw them again.</sentence><sentence id="161">And uh I only remember vaguely that there was a lot of panic around.</sentence><sentence id="162">Supposedly there was a list of about three hundred Jews, maybe not all in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span>, to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="163">Just a list of Jews to be killed.</sentence><sentence id="164">But it seems to me that as of the same time when the Jews were supposed to be killed, the Hungarians came in and took over and we were very happy that the Hungarians came in naturally.</sentence><sentence id="165">At least for a day or two we were happy, but then the atrocities started with the Hungarian army.</sentence><sentence id="166">Generally, it was accepted that armies marching in will commit atrocities.</sentence><sentence id="167">Ol:11: As kids we only heard that there were rapes and women tortured, breasts cut off...as children we heard those things happening.</sentence><sentence id="168">However we kind of for a while felt comfortable because they didn't kill all those Jews with the list and the Ukrainians were gone.</sentence><sentence id="169">Naturally my father didn't have a job by then because the Czechoslovakian government wasn't there and they put him to work in the <span class="DLF">mines</span>, in the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span>, down deep in the <span class="DLF">mines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="170">And we became very poor.</sentence><sentence id="171">However we were kind of proud people, my family.</sentence><sentence id="172">And I remember on Friday nights for the Sabbath that my mother covered empty pots on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> so we don't show anybody that we have nothing to eat, and that we have nothing to cook with, but all in all, my grandmother was making her popcorn and she then she moved in with us, and somehow we survived that part too.</sentence><sentence id="173">And there were a lot of beatings from the Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="174">Sometimes they went around the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, the Hungarians, all the villagers together which were not pure Hungarians...they were mixed Romanians, Hungarians, Slaves, Ukrainians, even Shobs (ph) were around in the <span class="REGION">area</span> and whoever was in their way or whatever they felt like attacking, they attacked and they hurt and they killed and 01:13: they took what they wanted.</sentence><sentence id="175">My father worked in the <span class="DLF">mines</span> and he also tried to go to the <span class="BUILDING">cattle markets</span> to see if he can do some business because people still ate.</sentence><sentence id="176">There were still a lot of butchers around and cattle and many times he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> beaten up and in the spring or early summer of 1941, while my father was away in a <span class="BUILDING">market</span>, the gendarme or whatever...I don't remember anymore what they were calling the police...came with an order to tell my mother that in a week, in a week we will be taken away, that we are not Hungarian citizens and we will be taken away someplace else, to someplace where there is work, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">Now as I say, my father was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then.</sentence><sentence id="178">What my mother did at first is what every Jew, good Jew will do...take the children and go to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and open the Torahs (ph) and cry and beg. .....</sentence><sentence id="179">Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="180">01:15: And we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that evening when we came back from the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span>, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with horses in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">My father was brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> beaten very severely and we took him in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="182">We did to him what we can and when my mother told him that we'll be taken away, she suggested we hide out and go to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sziget</span> or wherever and hide out, not to go.</sentence><sentence id="183">But my father felt it can't be any worse than it is.</sentence><sentence id="184">Let's go.</sentence><sentence id="185">So we went.</sentence><sentence id="186">In a week's time everybody got a bundle.</sentence><sentence id="187">We took what we can.</sentence><sentence id="188">We were not allowed to take anything else except what we can carry.</sentence><sentence id="189">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">They packed us into in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="191">I don't know if there were seventy or a hundred or how many.</sentence><sentence id="192">I know there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit.</sentence><sentence id="193">We were able to somehow stand and I also cannot tell you how long we were in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">They were not fast, and they took us...we don't know how we traveled...the geography of it.</sentence><sentence id="195">I can look at some names on the maps and remember where we were, but I don't know how we traveled with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> existed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="241">Q: Can you tell us about that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ride</span>?</sentence><sentence id="242">What was it like inside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="246">It was hot and crowded.</sentence><sentence id="247">No water.</sentence><sentence id="248">No hygiene.</sentence><sentence id="249">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="250">They didn't open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> for two, three days at a time.</sentence><sentence id="251">We had dead people in with us and when they stopped maybe every every three days when they stopped, we handed out the dead.</sentence><sentence id="252">They didn't let us do any hygiene or wash our clothes or anything.</sentence><sentence id="253">If you had some food with you, you ate something but you shared with your people that you were around, but there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to move.</sentence><sentence id="254">We kind of sat down everybody and where you could, but we really couldn't move.</sentence><sentence id="255">We stayed in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, night and day.</sentence><sentence id="256">Hygiene or not.</sentence><sentence id="257">Went on for I think about a week or so, because I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were put on <span class="DLF">side lines</span> and we stayed standing still.</sentence><sentence id="258">We were not always traveling.</sentence><sentence id="259">I don't know if they had a name where to bring us or not, but we were definitely standing still for many hours and hours and hours.</sentence><sentence id="260">The heat and the smell were... a young girl...in 1941 I was twelve going on thirteen, I think...I can't count now.</sentence><sentence id="261">I just remember the terrible smells and the terrible situation that it was.</sentence><sentence id="262">But we arrived...I think the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called Yassinga (ph) in the Ukrainian.</sentence><sentence id="263">We got out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="264">01:19: I don't know how many died on the way, how many we handed out.</sentence><sentence id="265">Most of the older people did go.</sentence><sentence id="266">Our grandmother stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">It was my family, my father, mother and the three children that were taken.</sentence><sentence id="268">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yassina</span> they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, also piled very close on and drove and I think they dropped us off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomeia</span>, I think.</sentence><sentence id="269">I'm not sure of the names and the <span class="DLF">route</span>.</sentence><sentence id="270">And we were still with the Hungarian guards when they dropped us off, and they said in the middle of a <span class="DLF">highway</span> they dropped us, you cannot come back.</sentence><sentence id="271">We will shoot you.</sentence><sentence id="272">You can only go <span class="NPIP">inside</span>, but from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> Ukrainian guards came with rifles and said to us, you can't go this way.</sentence><sentence id="273">You can only go back.</sentence><sentence id="274">We were on this on the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the Ukrainian shot started shooting and people were killed and I remember one of the men.</sentence><sentence id="275">His arms were shot off but it was hanging and bleeding and we were still in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we walked away to the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and most of the people sat down.</sentence><sentence id="276">Now we were a big group of people, because wasn't only from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but it was from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> doing the same thing, but the man that had his arm hanging begged, shoot me please.</sentence><sentence id="277">Please shoot me.</sentence><sentence id="278">At that time they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="279">They just let him stand and walk around with the families crying and begging.</sentence><sentence id="280">After a time...I don't know how much time.</sentence><sentence id="281">I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="282">I can't say.</sentence><sentence id="283">They let us walk towards <span class="NPIP">inside</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galacia</span> (ph) and but before that the man with the hanging arm was taken away and we heard the shots and the family dug a <span class="DLF">grave</span> at that time and they buried him.</sentence><sentence id="284">I don't know where it is, but there in that <span class="REGION">area</span> we also met people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> that came at that time.</sentence><sentence id="285">Now they did not have <span class="NPIP">places</span> where to take us.</sentence><sentence id="286">We only walked.</sentence><sentence id="287">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>.</sentence><sentence id="288">Outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> by the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and we kept on walking, day in and day out.</sentence><sentence id="289">No food.</sentence><sentence id="290">No water.</sentence><sentence id="291">No hygiene.</sentence><sentence id="292">Nothing.</sentence><sentence id="293">If we were lucky enough to be by a <span class="DLF">field</span> that was growing something that we could eat and we can take it, we tried to do that.</sentence><sentence id="294">The shooting was very easy.</sentence><sentence id="295">Anything they didn't like...that was the Ukrainian .</sentence><sentence id="296">Anything they didn't like or if they were annoyed they just take out the rifle or they hit with the rifle or they shoot with the rifle.</sentence><sentence id="297">They gave us rest maybe once or twice a day, and we walked.</sentence><sentence id="298">I don't know if it was twenty, twenty-five kilometers daily, children and older people.</sentence><sentence id="299">I remember there was a boy that walked next to us.</sentence><sentence id="300">It was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> by then...a few thousand people.</sentence><sentence id="301">He carried his sick old mother whose legs were very swollen, on his shoulder.</sentence><sentence id="302">He was young, about fifteen, sixteen year old boy...for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="303">Each time we rested he took her off the shoulder, put her down to rest.</sentence><sentence id="304">Then he got up, took her on the shoulder and carried her further and one day he didn't do it fast enough.</sentence><sentence id="305">They killed the mother right then and there, by the side.</sentence><sentence id="306">They wouldn't even give him time to bury her.</sentence><sentence id="307">01:24: We had to go on.</sentence><sentence id="308">The , they were very primitive people, very religious Catholics but very primitive.</sentence><sentence id="309">Very hateful towards us Jews.</sentence><sentence id="310">Some of them were happy to kill us and hit us and do the worst that they can do to people.</sentence><sentence id="311">Now at this time I only remember the walking and incidents that stand out.</sentence><sentence id="312">We came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that there was a <span class="DLF">well</span>.</sentence><sentence id="313">I see it in the middle like.</sentence><sentence id="314">I don't know where it was and what but it was a <span class="DLF">well</span> and we were like around the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and the __ were standing close to the <span class="DLF">well</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">A little boy...to me he looked very little... went over to him.</sentence><sentence id="316">Said can I have water.</sentence><sentence id="317">He said you want water, and the boy says please, water.</sentence><sentence id="318">He could hardly speak.</sentence><sentence id="319">And he took his rifle and shot him right there, next to him by his feet, because the boy wanted water.</sentence><sentence id="320">And that picture is with me through the years.</sentence><sentence id="321">I I live with it.</sentence><sentence id="322">I mean I don't think about it all the time but it's there.</sentence><sentence id="323">Sometimes when we rested like next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnjestr</span>, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Dnjestr</span>, we rested and there was a little girl from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bukovina</span> with her brother, with a big tall brother and a girl about...I don't know...she was older than me.</sentence><sentence id="324">She was beautiful with gold earrings, big black braids she had and they dunked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Dnjestr</span>, held her down.</sentence><sentence id="325">The two braids were on top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span>.</sentence><sentence id="326">They dunked her down into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and held her and then they pulled her up and they did that a few times and then they brought her out.</sentence><sentence id="327">Same day they picked out when we were resting at night by the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span>, they picked out men.</sentence><sentence id="328">They took them away.</sentence><sentence id="329">I remember it well because we lay on my father.</sentence><sentence id="330">We covered him, the children and my mother covered my father so they don't see him, so they don't take him away.</sentence><sentence id="331">They took...picked out ten, fifteen, twenty men, almost every day.</sentence><sentence id="332">We never heard from them again.</sentence><sentence id="333">We never saw them again.</sentence><sentence id="334">They were killed.</sentence><sentence id="335">They were killed like there is no consideration at all.</sentence><sentence id="336">In <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> after <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span>, wherever we went...killing old men in all way.</sentence><sentence id="337">And we walked that way until we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamenitz- Podolsk</span>.</sentence><sentence id="338"><span
