<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: What <span class="NPIP">year</span> was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: That was in the early thirties; | don't know exactly which year.</sentence><sentence id="112">So | was, | don't know, ten years old or twelve years old.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="115">Q: But you still were able to do other activities.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="117">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="118">| didn't curtail my activities at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="127">A: 1937, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="128">For instance, one of my fellow students told me | had remonstrated with him, that he didn't do so well in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore and he was a very intelligent guy.</sentence><sentence id="129">And he told me that he was very tired because every night he went across the <span class="DLF">borders</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for Hitler's coming.</sentence><sentence id="130">| didn't even believe it.</sentence><sentence id="131">| Doris Rauch 6 July 7, 1995 Page 6 thought he was just bragging in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="132">But today | know it was true.</sentence><sentence id="133">So -- and do you know then in 1938, Hitler occupied the Sudatin (ph) line?</sentence><sentence id="134">And | felt very strongly that my parents had done the wrong thing, that they sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="135">And | wore a Czech flag on my lapel in that year after Hitler really occupied the entire state and we had to wear a star instead of a flag.</sentence><sentence id="136">But | still feel that today that it was a great mistake that | did not go to a <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">So of course, the outcome would have been the same.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: But there was a choice when you were younger to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Czech school</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: Well, the choice was not up to me.</sentence><sentence id="153">| mean, the way we go to our -- yes, | could have gone.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: Yes, | mean, your parents had the choice, but they decided to send you to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span></sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="157">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="158">| went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that my father graduated from.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Alright, so it's now 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="161">A: Yes, but there's a big event before that.</sentence><sentence id="162">My father had lung cancer.</sentence><sentence id="163">And he died in 1936, when | was 16 years old.</sentence><sentence id="164">And that was very hard on me because | was very close to my father, much more so than to my mother.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And how did that change your life and your mother's life?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="171">A: Well, my mother tried to make a living by renting out a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to two girl students.</sentence><sentence id="172">She did all sorts of things.</sentence><sentence id="173">She had a representation -- no, you don't say that.</sentence><sentence id="174">Anyhow, she sewed, knit woolen materials to friends and got a commission on that.</sentence><sentence id="175">And then she sent all her friends to certain <span class="BUILDING">coffee shop</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="176">And there they had to say Doris Rauch 7 July 7, 1995 Page 7 that they were sent by my mother and she got a percentage from that.</sentence><sentence id="177">So my mother was very capable, although she never really worked.</sentence><sentence id="178">But she was very intelligent and very practical.</sentence><sentence id="179">And although there probably was some money, my father hadn't left anything because we just lived on his salary.</sentence><sentence id="180">But | think my mother inherited money from her mother.</sentence><sentence id="181">And | know she had stocks in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> because | used to go with her to collect the coupons.</sentence><sentence id="182">But she always made an effort to earn some money herself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: So that was 1936.</sentence><sentence id="196">Anything in 1937 that you recall?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="199">A: Well, | was -- you mean as far as anti-Semitism?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="201">Q: Or personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="203">A: Well, | was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> that summer, into a French-speaking family.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="205">Q: What did you know about Hitler at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="207">A: Well, we knew quite a bit.</sentence><sentence id="208">Perhaps not I, but my mother had a very close friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oldham</span> (ph).</sentence><sentence id="209">And this woman came to us once a year, usually, and my mother went to visit her.</sentence><sentence id="210">And she smuggled out some money from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before they immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span>.</sentence><sentence id="211">So we knew what was going on there.</sentence><sentence id="212">And then, also, Hitler occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in 1938 and one of my mother's brothers lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="213">So they all immigrated first to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> (ph) before they attempted to get a visa to someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="214">And they did eventually go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to <span class="REGION">unoccupied France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="215">And they got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> maybe 1940, 1939 or "40.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="225">Q: Do you remember being particularly frightened in 1938?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="227">A: Not really.</sentence><sentence id="228">But that was perhaps because | was so naive, you know?</sentence><sentence id="229">| grew up in a very protected way.</sentence><sentence id="230">And | was rather childish at that age.</sentence><sentence id="231">And my mother used to Doris Rauch 8 July 7, 1995 Page 8 say, "Nothing will happen to us.</sentence><sentence id="232">I'm happy here as long as | have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over my head."</sentence><sentence id="233">That was her constant saying.</sentence><sentence id="234">| would have liked to immigrate, but it wasn't easy because we didn't have any money out anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="235">And it was very difficult to get a visa to anyplace.</sentence><sentence id="236">But some of my friends succeeded, but we didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: Alright.</sentence><sentence id="248">And now it's 1938.</sentence><sentence id="249">Any other changes that you can recall?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="254">Of course, | graduated from <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="255">But | could no longer go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">That was 193--.</sentence><sentence id="257">You know, | don't remember how that was.</sentence><sentence id="258">Anyhow, | could not study.</sentence><sentence id="259">And my mother said --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="260">Q: Why could you not study?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Because they didn't admit Jews.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: How did that make you feel?</sentence><sentence id="264">Here you're a young, 18-year-old young woman.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: | don't remember.</sentence><sentence id="268">Probably not very well.</sentence><sentence id="269">But | was not -- as | said, | was very naive.</sentence><sentence id="270">And all this didn't touch me somehow.</sentence><sentence id="271">And my mother decided | should attend a class in a <span class="COUNTRY">Czech</span> -- that's what it was.</sentence><sentence id="272">We were not admitted to German-speaking universities.</sentence><sentence id="273">Maybe still to Czech, | don't know.</sentence><sentence id="274">But | went to a <span class="COUNTRY">Czech</span>, you would call it maybe post-graduate textile school because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> was full of <span class="BUILDING">textile factories</span>.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="275">And the so-called English cloth that was so famous really came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span> and was treated in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">You know, they had a special process they treated it with.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="277">But it was woven in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berdenau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">So she send me to a <span class="BUILDING">textile school</span> which did not interest me at all.</sentence><sentence id="279">| mean, we had to learn all about textile machinery and -- well, there was a possibility that perhaps | could become a designer.</sentence><sentence id="280">My mother still saw that we could live a normal life.</sentence><sentence id="281">But it was a wasted year so far as my future --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="282">Q: So you did go and study textiles.</sentence><sentence id="283">Doris Rauch 9 July 7, 1995 Page 9</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="284">A: | did go.</sentence><sentence id="285">| graduated from there.</sentence><sentence id="286">It was a lot of fun because we were only two girls and the rest were all young boys.</sentence><sentence id="287">So we had a good time, not knowing what was waiting for us.</sentence><sentence id="288">So | graduated from there in June of 1939 and we were already occupied by Hitler.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: How had your life changed when you became occupied.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: Well, it all came very gradually.</sentence><sentence id="297">First, we had to wear yellow stars.</sentence><sentence id="298">And then we had a curfew.</sentence><sentence id="299">We couldn't go into the <span class="DLF">street</span> | think it was seven or eight o'clock in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="300">We had to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="301">Then we were concentrated into certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, which meant that my mother -- because we lived on such a <span class="DLF">street</span>, we got, so to speak, renters into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="302">There were several -- there were two families in addition to us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that was only a three-room <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="326">A: Demeaning.</sentence><sentence id="327">That was the word | was looking for.</sentence><sentence id="328">So we had all those people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>, which -- for me, it was not so bad because | liked all the people.</sentence><sentence id="329">And | don't know how it was for my mother.</sentence><sentence id="330">But there was nothing we could do against it.</sentence><sentence id="331">And my favorite aunt, who was the only one of her family that left behind, had to move Doris Rauch 10 July 7, 1995 Page 10 to -- had a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span>, but her husband was gone.</sentence><sentence id="332">Her three daughters were gone.</sentence><sentence id="333">And she had to move into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span>.</sentence><sentence id="334">That made me very happy.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="344">Q: Were these restrictions frightening to you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="347">And it became more frightening as time went on.</sentence><sentence id="348">But in the meantime, after graduating from the <span class="BUILDING">textile school</span>, | got a job, an unpaid job, in a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="349">And | lived there five and a half days of the week and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the weekend.</sentence><sentence id="350">And | worked then all phases of the <span class="BUILDING">textile industry</span>.</sentence><sentence id="351">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> still belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish firm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">That's, | suppose, how | got the job, although it was unpaid.</sentence><sentence id="353">But it was good training for me had | ever gone into that <span class="DLF">field</span>, which | don't think | would have under normal circumstances.</sentence><sentence id="354">So | was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> only over the weekend.</sentence></p></dialogue>
