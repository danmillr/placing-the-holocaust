<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="77">And...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> broke loose, so to speak.</sentence><sentence id="78">Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday.</sentence><sentence id="79">It was on a Sunday morning.</sentence><sentence id="80">And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for my...for the uniforms of my basketball team.</sentence><sentence id="81">I was about |4years and I was...at 4:00 in the morning when I was extremely tired I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="82">And at 6:00 in the morning, I was woken and told that the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they're going to be in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> any day, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives.</sentence><sentence id="83">So we had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="84">My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our belongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my brother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side.</sentence><sentence id="85">And we just started toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="86">Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a day or so to get to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">I believe that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was where my father was born and I think it was named...I'm not really very sure.</sentence><sentence id="88">And that is when the Germans met us and the <span class="DLF">border</span> was closed, and there was no need to go any further.</sentence><sentence id="89">So we walked into the first abandoned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we found, probably was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span>, other people who ran away, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day.</sentence><sentence id="90">And in the meantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the <span class="DLF">doors</span>, vicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe.</sentence><sentence id="91">They were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we were Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="92">So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they asked...uh...what time it was.</sentence><sentence id="93">One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar Mitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was.</sentence><sentence id="94">They said, "Well, give me that watch immediately."</sentence><sentence id="95">And my brother kind of resisted, so when the Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed my brother's watch and just handed it over real fast.</sentence><sentence id="96">And this was our first introduction to the German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang around.</sentence><sentence id="97">There was no use to stay in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="98">We still had our horse, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and some of our belongings and we headed back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span>, through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">On the <span class="DLF">road</span>, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where they intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped all of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was on the <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">And they just kept us there for no reason at all.</sentence><sentence id="101">We...we spent a few nights there I believe <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, <span class="DLF">sky</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">It wasn't too bad.</sentence><sentence id="103">It wasn't cold...cold.</sentence><sentence id="104">It was summertime.</sentence><sentence id="105">And no...no one knew what the future's going to bring.</sentence><sentence id="106">But after that I remember...1 believe that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family.</sentence><sentence id="107">Exactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="139">Q: Tell us about the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Well, the <span class="DLF">Seventh port</span> was, I believe, an <span class="BUILDING">army base</span> before the war.</sentence><sentence id="145">It may have been some kind of a military defense area or something like that, but it was pretty green...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women.</sentence><sentence id="146">Uh...I remember that my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my father on my one <span class="NPIP">side</span>, and my mother and I...they took us in another area of the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span>.</sentence><sentence id="147">I was 11 years old at that time.</sentence><sentence id="148">And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of days...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I...1 remember that right before they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>, and the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span> was a similar place as the <span class="BUILDING">Seventh Fort</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span>, they had given them an order to some of the younger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the <span class="REGION">women's side</span>, and I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or 16 could go to the <span class="REGION">women's side</span> and my brother tried to go over.</sentence><sentence id="149">I don't know, he probably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do 60.And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older.</sentence><sentence id="150">Actually, he was 18.</sentence><sentence id="151">And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to...to...uh...his mother.</sentence><sentence id="152">And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there.</sentence><sentence id="153">All the men were shot, but my father was not there.</sentence><sentence id="154">This is another long story.</sentence><sentence id="155">My father was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army.</sentence><sentence id="156">I believe when <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in 1916 or something like that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="157">And while <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in certain prominent Close Lithuanian life.</sentence><sentence id="158">They were ...and they were honored many times.</sentence><sentence id="159">My father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it.</sentence><sentence id="160">Uh...So before they told all the youngsters or after to go to another <span class="NPIP">side</span>, to the <span class="REGION">women's side</span>, they also announced that everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers.</sentence><sentence id="161">Every man who was a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh.,</sentence><sentence id="162">soldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of there.</sentence><sentence id="163">And indeed, they did.</sentence><sentence id="164">They took them to a different <span class="NPIP">place</span>, which was called the...the <span class="BUILDING">Yellow Prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">They called it the <span class="BUILDING">Yellow Prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And I know that my father was there.</sentence><sentence id="167">So at that time my father was not shot.</sentence><sentence id="168">It was only my brother and my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="169">Then the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> I remember.</sentence><sentence id="170">And later on when we were released from the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fort</span>, after being there...uh...and..-uh...my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that.</sentence><sentence id="171">He was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>.</sentence><sentence id="172">And he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go to see his family.</sentence><sentence id="173">He said, "Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back."</sentence><sentence id="174">And my father came to visit us.</sentence><sentence id="175">He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="176">She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="177">We knew about that.</sentence><sentence id="178">And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also.</sentence><sentence id="179">They were shot.</sentence><sentence id="180">We heard all kinds of stories.</sentence><sentence id="181">Who knows why?</sentence><sentence id="182">But, we really don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="183">We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were and respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of these...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="184">Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="185">They...when the orders came, they told the Jews have to leave their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span>...their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and belongings.</sentence><sentence id="186">Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and move to that designated <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="54.915833" long="23.888334">Kovno</span> which was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="187">And my mother and I...we just took the things that we had.</sentence><sentence id="188">Couldn't...tried to exchange our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with</sentence><sentence id="190">some Lithuanians, but I guess we just were not successful.</sentence><sentence id="191">Some people did.</sentence><sentence id="192">Some people gave up big <span class="BUILDING">mansions</span> for little <span class="BUILDING">homes</span>, and...uh...they moved in there, but there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for everyone so they...people who had those <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> took in their families, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing.</sentence><sentence id="193">I and my mother, we shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a neighbor of ours who...uh...was...we were close before the war and...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my brother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they acquired somehow from some relatives or friends in one of those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and they took us in and we...shared one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>, the four of us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: Can you...can you go back.</sentence><sentence id="247">You had told me before that while your father was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> your mother had taken his papers and tried to do something?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="251">Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers...and his medals.</sentence><sentence id="252">And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of our encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by Lithuanian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="253">And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="254">I'm sure they gave all the orders.</sentence><sentence id="255">They were involved.</sentence><sentence id="256">But I we didn't see them.</sentence><sentence id="257">So we felt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday.</sentence><sentence id="258">She always kept them on her.</sentence><sentence id="259">Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: You had gone ahead and you are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> now?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Yes, I'm in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="273">But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should back up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in, although we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a volunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some...for the Lithuanian Army...for the Lithuanian army before the war.</sentence><sentence id="274">And he was friendly with some...uh...people in high command.</sentence><sentence id="275">And he find out where we lived there a general who was I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they sent him to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="276">And...and he had left his wife and children in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, and my father knew them.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some packages over there or even lumber to heat the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> most of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were heated by lumber, good lumber.</sentence><sentence id="278">And he...he was quite friendly with them and tried to help that particular year.</sentence><sentence id="279">And right after the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> right before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, we were sitting in this <span class="BUILDING">lady's house</span>, Mrs. Mudrick was her name, and...uh...just talking about the future in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and things like that, where we're going to move <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> or whatever and I...I looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span>.</sentence><sentence id="280">It, it was about two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> away from ours in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span>, and I looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> and here was the General walking with his wife and was going back to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the...on the... They lived...they had a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Panemon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="281">And I kind of felt a great feeling because I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that <span class="BUILDING">Yellow prison</span> that he was in.</sentence><sentence id="282">And I pointed her out to my mother, "Look who's walking by here.</sentence><sentence id="283">Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly.</sentence><sentence id="284">I'm sure he knows us.</sentence><sentence id="285">Especially...she knows us, and maybe they can do something," my mother went out real quick.</sentence><sentence id="286">I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like...they didn't</sentence><sentence id="288">even know us or pretended anyway.</sentence><sentence id="289">And...uh...she told them who we were and they nodded and she begged them to see if they'Il...can do something about releasing my father.</sentence><sentence id="290">But needless to t say, nothing happened.</sentence><sentence id="291">That is one incident that stayed with me.</sentence><sentence id="292">Uh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
