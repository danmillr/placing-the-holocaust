<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="13">A: Well, that's a very interesting question and I will illustrate it by, well, telling you what happened to me.</sentence><sentence id="14">I -- I went to a German school, as a matter of fact I was the only -- during Hitler time already, from 1934 to 1938 to Kristallnacht, I was the only Jewish student in a s --s -- student body of about 280 in a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that was a [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="15">One of the assignments we had -- now thas -- this was about 1936, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of course was very, a-as we would say, a -- a roots -- you know, tracing your roots.</sentence><sentence id="16">They were interested in genealogy.</sentence><sentence id="17">So one of our assignments in social studies was</sentence></p><p><sentence id="20">Interview with Kurt Roberg , March 16, 2001 to trace our ancestry.</sentence><sentence id="21">How was I gonna trace my ancestry?</sentence><sentence id="22">My --1-- ma-- my mother contacted her sister, a maiden sister who lived with my -- in my mother's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home village</span>, and contacted my father's maiden sister, who lived in my father's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home village</span>, and they both yeah, tried to do -- trace our history.</sentence><sentence id="23">And Martha, which was the Roberg side of the family, got as far as great-grandfather, didn't get very far.</sentence><sentence id="24">And Aunt

priest and he, as a favor, for 10 mark or so, wrote out our whole genealogy and we were able to trace the f -- Marx family back to 1741.</sentence><sentence id="29">So I drew up a family tree based on this information.</sentence><sentence id="30">This took about oh, a couple of months to get that all written out by hand, turning the pages in the book and it became a matter of fascination for the priest himself.</sentence><sentence id="31">And I drew a--a family tree, and I turned it in and it turned out that Roberg, the only Jew in the class, could trace his ancestry in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> back further than my 29 Christian stu -- fellow students.</sentence><sentence id="32">And my teacher, who was very s-supportive, and nya -- he was not a Nazi by any means, he made a point of it, to -- yeah, tell the class that Roberg could trace his ancestry back further than any of the German boys.</sentence><sentence id="33">So it's a longwinded answer to your

War I, he went into his own business across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Freidberg's</span>, set up a cint -- competition, and ma -- then the inflation came, and he

Some families moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span>, which was 40 kilometers.</sentence><sentence id="126">25 miles away was the nearest large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, some moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">The remaining active members in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> were about a dozen families.</sentence><sentence id="128">There were some Jewish people who were not active, they didn't attend services.</sentence><sentence id="129">They, I guess were Jews by religion only, or th-they -- the Germans so nicely put it, Jewish citizens of a Hebrew faith or persuasion.</sentence><sentence id="130">And that was by -- by choice, they really didn't want to be identified with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> per se, and that was their choice.</sentence><sentence id="131">Give you an illustration, for -- we only had services in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> three times</sentence><sentence id="133">a year, on the high holidays, rush -- you know, Passover and Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</sentence><sentence id="134">Well, Simchas Torah was observed, and you know, but we had trouble getting a minyan together, of course, and we were, by German standards Conservative, not Orthodox, but the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of course was built, like m-m-most <span class="BUILDING">German synagogues</span> with the women in -- in the upper, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span>, whatever you call it, and the men downstairs and only men counted for -- yeah, for minyan.</sentence><sentence id="135">However, if you were 12 years old and you were gonna be Bar Mitzvahed the following year, you could already be counted as a minyan man.</sentence><sentence id="136">So it was that kind of a thing, or if things got very tough and we were nine, as a last resort they would say -- we would send one of the boys, sometimes me, over to one of the non-observing Jews, one of them was Solomon -- Solomon and say -- ask Solomon if he'll come to minyan, you know, and then reluctantly and grumpily would come and di--- um, sit in for minyan.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="156">Q: How many Jewish families were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence><sentence id="157">How many Jewish families were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Observing or otherwise, maybe 12 or 14.</sentence><sentence id="161">I really haven't counted them, I can -- but I have -- I have the records at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, I mean, I can make that available if you're interested.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: So, your family was observant?</sentence><sentence id="165">How would you describe your family?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="168">A: Well, we were traditionally observant.</sentence><sentence id="169">My mother came from a observant family, meaning my grandmother kept milchig and fleishig separate.</sentence><sentence id="170">My father came from an Orthodox -- well, an observant family.</sentence><sentence id="171">My father's family, it's a family of butchers,</sentence></p><p></p><p><sentence id="175">kosher butchers, but I guess the scene at the turn of the 20" century was really the -- I'm sure I'm not telling you anything new, you know, the German Jewish community had been, well, had the opportunity for the first time to assimil -- well, to try and assimilate or at least to practice by choice, and the tendency was away from -- from religious observations and to assimilate, to try and assimilate.</sentence><sentence id="176">So there were many Jews who felt primarily as Germans of Jewish faith.</sentence><sentence id="177">And I guess we were -- my father ate treyf occasionally, because when he traveled he couldn't observe all th -- so as a-- as a boy, as a young man already, he stopped eating kosher as he did at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and my mother the same way when she got out into daily life, modified, and it was called new kosher, neu- kosher.</sentence><sentence id="178">New kosher meaning you would eat milk and meat mixed but no pork, and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="179">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="180">Did you observe the Sabbath, Shabbat?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: We were aware of Shabbat, but we were allowed to ride our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span>, while on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, we were not.</sentence><sentence id="182">So Shabbat was -- it was a work day for us, we couldn't afford to keep the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> closed and I guess that sort of set the pattern.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Were your parents Zionists?\</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: We were sympathetic -- well, Zionism for us started in 1933 or "34.</sentence><sentence id="187">We -- the community, our congregation was too small to have a rabbi, but we did have a cantor who was a retired schoolteacher and had a pension and he was the cantor and also our, well, Hebrew teacher and he would officiate at all services, of course.</sentence><sentence id="188">And that was -- but you know, we -- we didn't -- we didn't have a -- a rabbi, per se.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="195">Q: What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="196">A: German, what else?</sentence><sentence id="197">I mean, well, again, as you probably know, German Jews tried to ma -- be very low key, be as un-Jewish in appearance, not that we were ashamed or -- you know, of being Jews, we were conscious Jews, but we were Jews in religious observance, not, you know, it was not an ethnic group other than by designation by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="198">I mean, we were -- we were aware of being Jews, and we wanted to be Jews, but I guess we had no choice anyway, so --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="199">Q: Did you feel very German as a young child?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="200">A: N-No, that's a tough -- I wa -- we never really thought about it.</sentence><sentence id="201">We knew we -- we -- we knew we were nem -- you know, German, we knew we were Jews, and of course, well, consciously, wh-when Hitler came to power, it was in 1933, I was nine years old, I remember distinctly when I came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in 1930.</sentence><sentence id="203">Before that I went a year to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, I was four years old.</sentence><sentence id="204">And we were taught from small child on not to make any, as it was known as rishiss(ph).</sentence><sentence id="205">Are you familiar with the -- with the term rishiss(ph)?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="212">Q: No, could you explain it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="215">Rishass(ph) I think is a Hebrew word.</sentence><sentence id="216">It -- it is to draw attention to -- yeah, don't make wave, don't make rishiss(ph) means don't -- you know, don't draw attention to your Jewishness.</sentence><sentence id="217">If -- so if you did anything that would be disturbing to the Christian community, if you flaunted your Jewishness, you would say that makes rishiss(ph).</sentence><sentence id="219">Rishass(ph) is, I think -- I don't know what it is in Hebrew, but I-- anyway.</sentence><sentence id="220">So we were -- we were taught not to make waves, to conform, not to draw attention to ourselves by being obnoxious or obviously Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="221">Do the things that were ascribed by the Gentile community as being typically Jewish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="232">Q: Such as?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="234">A: Be loud, be boisterous and you know, I mean, if you would see somebody with -- with -- with -- with -- with payos, obviously they're -- and that -- that was a Jewish trait.</sentence><sentence id="235">Or to walk straight, to be -- Jews were thought of as being non-athletic.</sentence><sentence id="236">My mother was very proud that we excelled in sports, my brother and I, and it was part of our -- well, that we belonged, we were as good as they were.</sentence><sentence id="237">And well, it was odd that even my brother and I, during you know, Hitler times in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, were allowed to participate in sporting events which in many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span>, Jews were no longer allowed to participate.</sentence><sentence id="238">And I remember Harry, my brother, Hans got a gold oak leaf and -- with some event we -- we had -- from -- from our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we had the sports event and I got a bronze even -- oak leaf.</sentence><sentence id="239">Now, I must also tell you that on crystal -- the night -- yeah, Crystal Night, or the day -- the morning after Crystal Night, when we found out, you know, what had happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not searched or destroyed or what, but we expected that maybe the Gestapo or city police would come and search the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="240">And we got rid of -- my mother got rid of anything that would be intimidating, like foreign currency wi -- my mother had a few British pounds, Palestinian pounds th -- that her sister had brought back</sentence><sentence id="242">from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1934, and the oak leaves that Harry and I had earned, because if they would come in and say -- see that we had oak leaves, maybe the feeling was, what are you trying to prove, you Jew bastards?</sentence><sentence id="243">You know.</sentence><sentence id="244">So she got rid of it, not to antagonize the police should they come, and should they find this and question it.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1540">A: And so we were aware of what was going on, you know, but my uncle was convinced that -- that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would remain neutral, that the Germans would need <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> as a <span class="DLF">window</span> to the world, just as they did during World War I and so he convinced my</sentence><sentence id="1542">mother to let me stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1543">And it made business sense, you come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, I was still of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> age, my father couldn't work, who is gonna support us, right?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1549">Q: What were your thoughts about that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1551">A: Didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="1552">My thought -- I mean, whatever the -- whatever the decision was, children weren't asked in those days and I was -- I was happy to stay with my uncle and finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and all.</sentence><sentence id="1553">I thought it was best for me to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> rather than starting to -- you know, and I studied English, I was learning English, and to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as prepared as I could be rather than coming in there having no trade, not knowing your language, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="1554">So it was -- was a rational decision and we were -- we were convinced that <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> would stay neutral.</sentence><sentence id="1555">So anyway -- so there was the story.</sentence><sentence id="1556">So they left on April 5", 1940.</sentence><sentence id="1557">While they were at <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, on April 10,1940, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and overran <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, and my mother was in panic.</sentence><sentence id="1560">Beginning Tape Three, Side A</sentence></p></dialogue>

id="1591">I mean, the individual policeman could have been sympathetic and knew what a -- that the German Jews were not -- you know, in -- were not sympathetic to the German government, but there were
