<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="149">Q: And what does that mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="151">A: He was very close to the -- the rabbi, and when he ki -- first of all, he supported him substantially.</sentence><sentence id="152">And when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beltz</span>, where the rabbi lived, is -- my father was called [indecipherable] Tomasheva, that was a big to-do.</sentence><sentence id="153">If the rabbi or his family, or his brother, who was the chief rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bilgori</span>, which was a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tomashev</span>, they stayed in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="154">This is something extra, extra special.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="159">Q: Mm.</sentence><sentence id="160">So your father was a prominent person?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="169">Q: And mother.</sentence><sentence id="170">So tell me about him.</sentence><sentence id="171">What do you remember about your father?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="175">A: Well, first of all, you'll have to bear in mind that we are dealing about a period where Jews were confined to their own cultural environment.</sentence><sentence id="176">And my father, for in-- to give you an example, was very friendly with the township judge.</sentence><sentence id="177">But being friendly with the township judge did not mean that the township judge invited my father for dinner, or my father invited the judge for dinner.</sentence><sentence id="178">But they were very, very friendly, you know, and th -- my father was very respected.</sentence><sentence id="179">As far as our material position in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span>, I would say we were considered one of the wealthiest people, and this had it's impact also.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: And your father was as a -- a business person?</sentence><sentence id="186">He ran a --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="189">A: My father, yes.</sentence><sentence id="190">My father concentrated on -- we -- we were millers.</sentence><sentence id="191">And some <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> we owned, and some <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> we leased and operated.</sentence><sentence id="192">But we were millers for generations, you know?</sentence><sentence id="193">And my mother was a very, very bright woman, very bright woman, very unusual woman, and she was running businesses on her own.</sentence><sentence id="194">She had a wholesale import, and -- an import business of tea, and coffee, and -- and spices, and you know -- it was a very large business.</sentence><sentence id="195">L-Large to an extent -- to give you it -- it's -- it will sound funny.</sentence><sentence id="196">When salespeople came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- it's going to be difficult to describe it for you in English, because in English the -- in Polish there is a difference between male and female when you refer to somebody.</sentence><sentence id="197">In English you don't -- who is Joan Ringleheim, who is Miles Lerman?</sentence><sentence id="198">But in Polish is, this is -- you know, defined in masculine, and in -- in -- in -- in</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="209">Q: In feminine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="211">A: In feminine.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="213">Q: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: And salesmen used to come and ask who is this, but referring to it, you know, as a man, Jarket Lerman, you know.</sentence><sentence id="216">In other words, they couldn't believe that a business of this magnitude, of this size, is run and operated by a woman.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="219">Q: So how did that happen?</sentence><sentence id="220">It's so unusual, it would seem to me, during that era.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="223">A: Yes, yeah, yes.</sentence><sentence id="224">You have to bear in mind that for women to be involved in -- in the p -- in -- in -- in the task of earning a living was not unusual in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, because you have to understand that going back not too many years, not too many decades, it was the nicest thing.</sentence><sentence id="225">The best thing that could happen to a man is to sit and study Torah, and his wife was the breadwinner.</sentence><sentence id="226">But the breadwinner, she had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stall</span>, you know, and was selling a herring, or you know, or some flour, or some sugar, you know, and scraped out a living.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="231">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="233">A: This is not what my mother did.</sentence><sentence id="234">My mother ran a very, very large <span class="BUILDING">business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="235">And it was difficult for th -- [indecipherable] I told you, it was difficult for them to conceive that a woman is on this level.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Did she come from a family where they were business people as well, is this what --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: Well, y-yes, my grandfa -- I remember my grandfather on the ma -- on the <span class="REGION">maternal side</span>, he was at -- he had a -- he was mun -- he was in charge, he had -- I was gonna call it a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, it was not a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, it was a plant, where they were making wooden shingles, because wooden shingles were used, you know, for <span class="DLF">roofs</span>, and this was th -- it's like having a -- a roofing business, you know.</sentence><sentence id="242">So, yes, they came from a business family, but not of the size, and not of the caliber that my mother developed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: So the kids of the family, did they help in the <span class="BUILDING">milling business</span> of your father?</sentence><sentence id="246">Didn't you help more with your mother?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: Depends.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="248">Q: Depends.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="250">A: It depends.</sentence><sentence id="251">This was not the only business we had.</sentence><sentence id="252">We had a wholesale business of liquor, which is, you know, this -- this -- you needed special license for it.</sentence><sentence id="253">So, my brother, for instance, when he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tomashev</span>, was in charge of the liquor business.</sentence><sentence id="254">My sister Peshe and her husband were in charge helping mother with her business.</sentence><sentence id="255">My older sister, Esther, and her second husband -- because she lost her husband at a very early age, were in charge of helping father with the <span class="BUILDING">mills</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">So everybody did something, you know, specifically, and mother and father were directing traffic, they were, you know --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="264">Q: And you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I -- I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">I was the youngest, you know, and my father died in 1938.</sentence><sentence id="268">Normal death, you know.</sentence><sentence id="269">When I say normal, it was not part of the Holocaust --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="274">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="276">A: -- it was 1938.</sentence><sentence id="277">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and the family decided now because I wa -- I studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span>, you know, so the family decided that mother is going to need help, and you know, and there will be a reshuffling of who will do what, and they decided that I need to interrupt my schooling and stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, which I regret very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="300">A: No, this was -- my being the youngest was a plus, because everybody felt that they -- you know, I'm the kid, the kid brother, and they need to be good to me, and they need to be good with me, and they need to play a role in, you know, in bringing me up, because bear in mind that mother is, you know, the impressive person she was in the world of business, she was an extremely religious woman.</sentence><sentence id="301">She bought a <span class="BUILDING">shaitel</span>, you know what a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shaitel</span> is?</sentence></p></dialogue>
