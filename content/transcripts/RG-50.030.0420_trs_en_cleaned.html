<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Your Majesty, I would like to thank you for agreeing to share with us your recollections of a very complicated period in your life, and critical period in <span class="COUNTRY">Romanian</span> history.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="3">Before we begin, for the camera, could you please tell us your name, when you were born and where you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="4">A: Now, this thing of the name is something which is very confusing to very many people.</sentence><sentence id="5">My name is Michael, as you know, but this -- I don't want to make too many explanations, but anyhow just tell you how things are.</sentence><sentence id="6">Of course, our family comes from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sigmaringen</span>, become the first -- the first king of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> was a Hohenzollern, like my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="7">But that ended with my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="8">So we, in fact, do not have a family name in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="9">The family name of Hohenzollern is the origin, but that does not figure in any document or [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="10">So that's why I said it's a bit confusing.</sentence><sentence id="11">So, the result is that we are called by our name and then add, of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="12">So that's how things are now.</sentence><sentence id="13">I was born on the 25" of October, 1921, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sinaia</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which unfortunately doesn't exist any more because the o-original one burnt down, and it was rebuilt in 1954 - 56, the modern one.</sentence><sentence id="14">So that's about all for the introduction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="26">Q: Thank you, thank you.</sentence><sentence id="27">Your majesty, King Carol returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in 1930.</sentence><sentence id="28">You were nine years old.</sentence><sentence id="29">As I understand it, he took charge of your education and upbringing at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="34">Can you talk with us about your relationship with your father in those years, and about the education that he organized for you?</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="38">A: Well, two things here.</sentence><sentence id="39">One was my personal feelings and personal relationship with him, and the second <span class="NPIP">part</span> was a j -- was about the schooling.</sentence><sentence id="40">My personal relationship with him, to put it quite frankly, was not all the very best.</sentence><sentence id="41">I don't know how many people in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> are quite aware of what went on at that period.</sentence><sentence id="42">I don't want to say too strongly, but his private life is the one that -- that other people know more about.</sentence><sentence id="43">As you know, probably, that he had a connection with a certain person.</sentence><sentence id="44">As far as I could recollect what I was told, that started when I was about two years old.</sentence><sentence id="45">And in the 20's he left <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and renounced his rights to the family and to the throne and to everything concerning <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence><sentence id="46">So then when he came back in 1930, with a promise that this person was not going to come back with him.</sentence><sentence id="47">He finally did bring it back.</sentence><sentence id="48">So this situation got, well let's say practically out of hand.</sentence><sentence id="49">Because of this, my mother had to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">So she left for good in 1932.</sentence><sentence id="51">So he had been away in the 20's, and my mother looked after me and gave me -- this is the way we [indecipherable] in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>, you know, the first seven years at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">And that's something that normally remains with one for the rest of your life.</sentence><sentence id="53">And the life after, when my father came was so totally different that it just was very, very difficult for me to really take it.</sentence><sentence id="54">Well, that's one part, but the part of my education where I must say I was thankful to him because he had an idea, which is certainly very well.</sentence><sentence id="55">He made a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me inside the <span class="DLF">palace grounds</span>, but in the [indecipherable] and we started with 12 boys in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, each one of them from another part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and from completely different social standings.</sentence><sentence id="56">From sons of simple peasants right up to sons of some industrialists, or intellectuals.</sentence><sentence id="57">So that helped me to, say to rub shoulders with a very good part of the Romanian people, even if at our age.</sentence><sentence id="58">And the teachers that we had were selected of some of the best run <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>, especially one <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="59">And then at the end of every <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, for about three weeks, we took off in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with everybody in it, the professors and all of</sentence><sentence id="61">us, in a different part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, we -- well, we took our lessons and courses in geography and history on the actual <span class="NPIP">place</span> where these things ac -- happened.</sentence><sentence id="62">So that is how I got to know my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, as much as possible, every little <span class="NPIP">corner</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">I mean not every, it's very difficult, but a lot.</sentence><sentence id="64">Well, that has served me all through my life.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="94">Q: You have just described a difficult relationship with King Carol.</sentence><sentence id="95">As you grew up in those years, did he talk with you and share his views about the political developments in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> that he was confronting?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="98">A: I forgot again.</sentence><sentence id="99">I forgot to mention one thing, that although my mother was gone, [indecipherable] with something was rather painful for me because he only let me go to see her twice a year for three weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span>, because she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="100">You know, she loved art so much, she f-found a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> there from 1932 and bought this <span class="NPIP">place</span>, and that's where I used to go and see her.</sentence><sentence id="101">And I can say that those six months in -- those few mon -- not few months, few weeks, I'm sorry, few weeks at the time, I could say that that really charged my batteries, because otherwise it would have been really, if I can use the expression, absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span>, sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="102">Now as far his political life and that, again, I don't think many people understand the situation at the time.</sentence><sentence id="103">I was never, at least not from him ever told what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="104">We learned a certain amount of political systems in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>, but that was very dry, not in practice.</sentence><sentence id="105">So in all these events that f-finally led up to 1940 when he had to leave, I knew about them, of course, as a <span class="DLF">side line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="106">But I had to try and find out by myself from various people, but I never got anything from him, from my father.</sentence><sentence id="107">And that was a terrible handicap when he left, because I was suddenly -- found myself in a position without actually knowing all the details.</sentence><sentence id="108">I knew a lot of things that were going on, but not all the details on how everything worked.</sentence><sentence id="109">And that made life really difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="128">Q: How did you find out what was going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="130">A: What?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="132">Q: How did you find out what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="134">A: Well, of course, I could see the newspapers and some other people -- and some of the boys used to tell me things that I always expected my father to say.</sentence><sentence id="135">So that's the -- that is a very sketchy thing and it's not the real basics of what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="136">That I didn't find out except much, much later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: Can you describe your reaction if -- if you were aware of the significance of this, of the rise of Hitler to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="142">A: Well, of course, that's -- everybody knew, I knew, we saw in the papers, we knew what was happening with him, yes.</sentence><sentence id="143">Well, I could put it then that in the later part of the 30's, all of Europe was catching fire, see, so we were unfortunately in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> geographically, in a very, very difficult situation from the east, then the pressures from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="144">We had alliances before with [indecipherable] many people knew, which when Hitler started bullying Europe, these alliances fell to pieces, unfortunately.</sentence><sentence id="145">So our part of Europe was left uncovered.</sentence><sentence id="146">We had maybe an advantage as a disadvantage because we have oil, and Hitler needed oil.</sentence><sentence id="147">We have the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> [indecipherable] part of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">I think he liked that <span class="NPIP">part</span> also.</sentence><sentence id="149">So the whole political situation was getting more and more complicated, more and more involved.</sentence><sentence id="150">But I just found these things out in a [indecipherable] so to speak, not the actual basics, not the actual mechanism of it.</sentence><sentence id="151">That was my difficulty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="162">Q: Did you have the same difficulty knowing what -- what happened in Romanian political life at that time?</sentence><sentence id="163">There was a -- this was a period when right wing parties began to appear in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="169">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="170">Of course [indecipherable] these people that used to come, wanting audiences to my father, but just very rarely other people, we had certain festivities.</sentence><sentence id="171">I knew a lot of them.</sentence><sentence id="172">I knew quite a lot of what they were and what they were doing, but that's about all.</sentence><sentence id="173">I had no actual proper contact with these people.</sentence><sentence id="174">They just sort of just -- you know, like a -- how shall I say, meet at a party, that sort of thing.</sentence><sentence id="175">But not in depth.</sentence><sentence id="176">Now that was very difficult.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="185">Q: Some historians have said that some of those right wing political groups, the Iron Guard in particular --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="187">Q: -- had great appeal to young people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="188">Were you aware of -- of their mass ap- appeal to young people here?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="191">A: Well, among the young people, yes, I have caught, how do I -- shall I say, from their point [indecipherable] long, because through their parents, I suppose, and themselves, they realized what had happened with me and my mother.</sentence><sentence id="192">Now that did -- I must say it was very, very gratifying because whenever we met these young people [indecipherable] the warmth was extraordinary.</sentence><sentence id="193">Maybe I didn't quite understand why it was happening, what the reason for it was, but this I found out years later, because they realized what it was which was happening with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="194">And then you mentioned the point about the extreme right coming up, and that [indecipherable] influenced politically my father.</sentence><sentence id="195">Because I must say something here, which I don't want to be badly understood.</sentence><sentence id="196">But this person that was the cause of my mother's sadness, she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="197">Not that I have any particular feelings about that, but I have a feeling of what -- because of her, what happened with my mother.</sentence><sentence id="198">And those extreme rights were [indecipherable] the Nazi fifth column, you know, were anti-Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="199">That, of course, connected with my father, from his private life.</sentence><sentence id="200">Because during the 30's I must also admit that <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> progressed</sentence><sentence id="202">enormously, if not politically, but economically.</sentence><sentence id="203">We have our money, the leu was practically at the level of the dollar in the end of the 30's.</sentence><sentence id="204">We had a standard of living like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="205">So s -- some good did come, very much good.</sentence><sentence id="206">The trouble was the pol-political part that was not quite as it should have been.</sentence><sentence id="207">And this background of my father with these others is a complicated matter.</sentence><sentence id="208">And then of course, some political tendency, like in all parts of Europe, you know, we still have this -- how shall I put this, sort of a Byzantine influence, which is completely different to what we know in the west, politically speaking.</sentence><sentence id="209">That also didn't quite fit in with some of my father's ideas.</sentence><sentence id="210">And that's why, towards the end of the 30's, he formed a sort of a [indecipherable] we like to call it, which was not quite the thing to do, because when the real trouble started, we didn't have the old political parties to lean on.</sentence><sentence id="211">And then you got the situation that the extreme right started agitating out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="212">Very complicated situation and he fell into that.</sentence><sentence id="213">Now, these are all things that I -- not studied, I'll say, but I found out many more details many years after.</sentence><sentence id="214">But at the time we were all very worried and I could not make out exactly what was going on in detail, because I wasn't told.</sentence><sentence id="215">I had to try and pick it up here and there.</sentence><sentence id="216">That's very much in a nutshell.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: What was your father's view about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>?</sentence><sentence id="246">What were his feelings, his personal feelings and his political feelings?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: About me personally?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: Abo -- about Jew -- Jewish people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Oh.</sentence><sentence id="254">Well, he never talked about them.</sentence><sentence id="255">Not a word.</sentence><sentence id="256">That is also something pretty extraordinary because we knew what was going on with Hitler and so on, but he never said a word to me.</sentence><sentence id="257">So I can't really say what he actually felt about that.</sentence><sentence id="258">I'm sorry, that -- just one of those things I couldn't --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="270">Q: An-and what did he think about the Iron Guard?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="272">A: Well, that --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: Did he -- did he speak about that?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="274">A: Well, the Iron Guard you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="276">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="278">A: Yeah, well that, of course, I could feel it more than hear it, to understand that he was, of course, not at all for that.</sentence><sentence id="279">He didn't want that at all.</sentence><sentence id="280">They were attacking him because of this person.</sentence><sentence id="281">And there were certain things that went on of course, which we also found out much later.</sentence><sentence id="282">Like the execution of these whole group of Iron Guard people.</sentence><sentence id="283">I still can't make out exactly if he approved this or if he instigated this, or it was done by some of the government people without him knowing [indecipherable] that I really cannot say, because I was not told.</sentence><sentence id="284">And even today I'm not very clear [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="285">Q: That execution of the group of Iron Guard people, including Corneliu Codreanu himself, took place as your father was returning from a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="286">This was actually a visit that you began --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="287">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="289">Q: -- with him --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="290">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>.</sentence><sentence id="292">Could you talk about that trip --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: -- to -- to, I believe <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span> and what your goals were and what the results were.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="299">A: Well, that again comes into the same <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> with me, because I was there officially with him, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and then we went to [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="300">But what was going on <span class="NPIP">underneath</span>, the discussions he had around these <span class="NPIP">places</span>, I never knew a thing.</sentence><sentence id="301">It seems inconceivable, this thing, in a way, but unfortunate that that's how it was.</sentence><sentence id="302">I just know that the English visit -- you know, the English royal family, and many of the English people, did not appreciate my father at all because of his private life.</sentence><sentence id="303">So, the official part, of course, had to go along as it normally goes, but couldn't exactly feel hostility, but you felt something that was not quite the same as another <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="304">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that was different and of course when we ended up in [indecipherable], of course I knew what Hitler was doing and I knew who he was and so on, but I was not involved.</sentence><sentence id="305">My father and him went up in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there, and what happened, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="306">What I heard that was being said, apparently, I c -- but I can't be sure, but Hitler must have said something about the extremists.</sentence><sentence id="307">In what way and how, I really can't tell.</sentence><sentence id="308">But whether what happened with Iron Guard execution was because of this, a-again, I'm sorry, I can't -- I really don't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="319">Q: You met Adolf Hitler at -- on that occasion.</sentence><sentence id="320">Was that the first time you had met him and can you tell us your impressions of him and the people around him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: Well, of course I saw them all around there the first time I have ever been to this <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="324">But [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="325">That was a very -- just to show you, there was a awkward thing that happened that's [indecipherable] neither here nor there in this whole thing, because everybody knew my passion for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and mechanics.</sentence><sentence id="326">So I happened to look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw his big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="327">So one of his aides, I think, was [indecipherable] so, are you interested in autos?I said well, yes.</sentence><sentence id="328">So they took me down and offered me to go in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> of his, ride it up to the</sentence><sentence id="330"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> at the little eagle's nest, what you call it, it was on top of the [indecipherable] and we went down, ju-just to show you I was out of all this thing that was going on in-<span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: And your father did not reveal in his attitude or -- or mood, what was happening?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: No [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="345">Q: In this same trip, when you visited the <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span> -- I know because I've seen a photograph of a dinner at <span class="BUILDING">Guild Hall</span>, where you were seated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="346">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="348">Q: Can you talk about him?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="350">A: No, I think we just talked, you know, what one talks at a big party like that, but nothing else.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="351">And some of the <span class="BUILDING">newspapers</span> had some funny jokes about that.</sentence><sentence id="352">They were wondering if I talked to him about fishing, because he was supposed to be a good fisherman, or something, but not -- you know --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="353">Q: So at this time you were not aware of or talking about the Munich accords and the results of this for <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="354">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="355">Not at all, unfortunately.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: When did you become aware of th anti-Semitic nature of political groups like the Iron Guard, and the League of National Christian Defense of -- of Achay Cuza, and -- and the National Christian Party that had both Goga and Cuza.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="360">A: Well, there was Cuza, of course I met him, but I didn't have very much contact with him, so on.</sentence><sentence id="361">But all through the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, the deg37 - deg38 - deg39, I could feel it was -- something was boiling up.</sentence><sentence id="362">And I was again, very much aware of what was happening, but without knowing all</sentence><sentence id="364">0 the underneath and how the mechanism was working.</sentence><sentence id="365">What was happening is -- well we were all very concerned.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="373">Q: Did you ever see the demonstrations that took place in the <span class="DLF">street</span> by these groups?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="375">A: No, no, no, we were all but closed in in this thing, and when we used to go out, any event or something locally, that was kept out.</sentence><sentence id="376">But, when he got to the [indecipherable] in the beginning of 1940, then of course I could hear them screaming <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, not yet.</sentence><sentence id="377">Now then -- I did find out that they were screaming because they wanted all the change because of what happened with Codreanu and the [indecipherable] this whole story has ever been brought up and [indecipherable] getting more and more acute.</sentence><sentence id="378">Not yet. [</sentence><sentence id="379">indecipherable] I didn't know.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: You made reference earlier, your Majesty, to the political reorganization that your father made here in na -- in the early part of 1938.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: Mm.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="557">A: Well, this was getting on, as I said before, when -- this is a little before the beginning of September, 1914, when he called back Antonescu.</sentence><sentence id="558">He made a prime minister, I think it was at the time.</sentence><sentence id="559">Accidentally, I happened to be just outside my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> when Antonescu was in there.</sentence><sentence id="560">And when he came out, he saw me there, he came straight up to me and just said -- he -- he always had this funny habit of talking in the third person, you know, about himself.</sentence><sentence id="561">A-Awkward.</sentence><sentence id="562">So he came up to me and she said General Antonescu guarantees the situation.</sentence><sentence id="563">Then he left.</sentence><sentence id="564">Now what did he guarantee, what was the situation?</sentence><sentence id="565">I had no idea.</sentence><sentence id="566">So we come to the last part of it, this was on the fifth of September.</sentence><sentence id="567">On or before that, he had another audience with Antonescu</sentence><sentence id="569">6 when Antonescu demanded that he give up nearly all his prerogatives to Antonescu.</sentence><sentence id="570">That just left him with a few -- put it little bit vulgar in a way, [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="571">So on the fifth of September, we could hear shooting going on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="572">The guards around the <span class="DLF">palace grounds</span> were reinforced [indecipherable], I met him in the <span class="DLF">garden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="573">But all that night we stayed awake, until about five o'clock in the morning, and then a courier came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antonescu</span> with a letter.</sentence><sentence id="574">It was given to him, he opened it, and as he was reading I could vaguely see his color was draining.</sentence><sentence id="575">And he gave this letter to this man that was the gray matter behind him, a man called Ludverrano, just gave it to him, so that he read it also, and then he said to my father in French, because he used to talk a mixture of languages, he said, nothing more to do.</sentence><sentence id="576">So I was, you know, sort of shaken out of a haze, so I just said, well, what's this?</sentence><sentence id="577">So then they read it to me, in which Antonescu demanded his abdication because of all sorts of things, the political situation, this [indecipherable] one thing, my mother and so on, a whole mixture of things, and that -- then -- demanding his abdication.</sentence><sentence id="578">So that was that.</sentence><sentence id="579">That's at five o'clock in the morning, we hadn't slept all night, and funnily enough there's a certain lady there, was a -- a -- present at this same thing.</sentence><sentence id="580">What she had to do with [indecipherable] I don't know, but anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="581">So I went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>.</sentence><sentence id="582">And about nine o'clock in the morning, the telephone rang.</sentence><sentence id="583">Now one of the ladies, she said, quick, get up, get dressed to take the oath.</sentence><sentence id="584">Now [indecipherable] slept for two hours.</sentence><sentence id="585">So that's what happened.</sentence><sentence id="586">I went back into the <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> after I sort of woke up.</sentence><sentence id="587">And there's Antonescu, the patriarch, the president of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme court</span>, and one or two others.</sentence><sentence id="588">Horia Sima was not there.</sentence><sentence id="589">They said he was, but he wasn't.</sentence><sentence id="590">So I took the oath.</sentence><sentence id="591">And as my father had given him all those prerogatives, he put under my nose [indecipherable] so many people didn't understand how I can, but he made me, forced me to sign it, that <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> became a -- a national legionnaire state.</sentence><sentence id="592">You probably don't remember all that stuff.</sentence><sentence id="593">Well, this was, again, because of my non-information of what had</sentence><sentence id="595">7 been going on.</sentence><sentence id="596">I did not quite understand what was going on really.</sentence><sentence id="597">So this situation was -- was again, kept quite out of [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="598">Now one thing I must say that I was extremely grateful to Antonescu in all this unpleasantness that he did bring my mother back.</sentence><sentence id="599">And I consider this one thing, that if it wouldn't have been for her all those awful years, I don't know what I would have done, cause she -- she kept me going, in a way.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1085">A: Ah, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1086">Well, he thought it was a -- because I was the head of [indecipherable] you see.</sentence><sentence id="1087">He was commanding it, but I was the head.</sentence><sentence id="1088">It's a very awkward situation there because that was all these arrangements that was left over from my father.</sentence><sentence id="1089">So he found, and I suppose it was fairly right, that once our troops were fighting anyhow, I should show myself among them.</sentence><sentence id="1090">Which was nat-natural, yes, but not, I don't think for any other reason, but just that, to be among them,</sentence><sentence id="1092">9 which I did, in two or three <span class="NPIP">places</span>, in [indecipherable] and some other <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the fronts in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> when it started, also.</sentence><sentence id="1093">But only once or twice, not more.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1105">Q: How did you finally convince Antonescu not to deport more Jews?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1107">A: This is a -- it's a very long story, but I'll try and concentrate it somehow, because we were so distressed about going into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, because it was none of our business.</sentence><sentence id="1108">I know the Romanians -- see, generations, you look at our history, all our troubles that we've had here had always come from the east.</sentence><sentence id="1109">So after the Russian revolution, slowly, slowly, all these years, we saw what was going on there, so this was certainly not in our mentality.</sentence><sentence id="1110">So the fact to take back Tr- Transylvania and -- I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchovina</span> was perfectly in agreement with that, but not any further.</sentence><sentence id="1111">So, as things were getting from bad to worse, we'd realized maybe before th-that this is going to end extremely badly.</sentence><sentence id="1112">We got together in a clandestine -- I sort of picked the words not quite right, if you like, on the sly, with [indecipherable] and our group of some officers, to try and find a way to get out of the war.</sentence><sentence id="1113">And this started already in the end of "42, it went all through deg43 and deg44.</sentence><sentence id="1114">That's how we had the -- well, there again you have Antonescu which is an awkward situation [indecipherable] with the Germans, doing everything with the Germans and at the same time he let people from these two parties go out to [indecipherable].They let them even have, some of them that were in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, radio transmitter.</sentence><sentence id="1115">I-It's one of these situations that doesn't make sense, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1116">But anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1117">So we sent some people out to try and contact the allies, that is the American and the Great Britain, to see what we can do.</sentence><sentence id="1118">We probably don't want to go on with this [indecipherable] we have to get out.</sentence><sentence id="1119">So these discussions and negotiations, recall they went on quite a long time til late deg43 and "44, when <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> said that we won't discuss with you any more, because you're bringing the Communist Socialist group in this.</sentence><sentence id="1120">We were all shocked about these things because what else we gotta do?</sentence><sentence id="1123">0 We have in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> an -- an population of 20 million people, about.</sentence><sentence id="1124">We had known, about 500 Communist members and another 300 sympathizers.</sentence><sentence id="1125">Well, what do they got to do with what -- this, you see?</sentence><sentence id="1126">We found that out much later, that it was the Soviet [indecipherable] that we should bring them in.</sentence><sentence id="1127">So anyhow, they try and get [indecipherable], the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> happened.</sentence><sentence id="1128">The situation was getting more and more dangerously acute.</sentence><sentence id="1129">So we finally decided that we must find the right moment to tell Antonescu that he has to stop this war, or make an armistice.</sentence><sentence id="1130">So if he doesn't want to, he's got to be put out.</sentence><sentence id="1131">That's not very easy to say, but, you know, their job was going up and down <span class="NPIP">inside</span> <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> all the time.</sentence><sentence id="1132">The Gestapo sitting here, next to the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Palace</span> and the German commander too, recall [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1133">It's not very funny, so to speak, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1134">We had -- just when the worst part is happening, the Russian troops were coming close to our <span class="DLF">borders</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1135">The Germans funnily enough, they took two Panzer divisions from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and put them up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1136">Maybe -- maybe you heard about all this.</sentence><sentence id="1137">But that gave us a sort of a little <span class="INT_SPACE">breathing space</span>, but we still couldn't do anything on our own completely, because we asked for help from the allies, which we didn't even get an answer from then.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And that's because of the Soviets, we knew that after.</sentence><sentence id="1139">So, to bring a very long story short, when the front collapsed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> in the north, Antonescu came back from the front in the 22"4 or something like that, in August, through an indiscretion [indecipherable] we heard the telephone conversation, from his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span>, saying that Antonescu is going back on the front on the 24", I think was.</sentence><sentence id="1140">Well our arrangement, which have already been done, was to call him on the 26".</sentence><sentence id="1141">We asked for strong American bombardment, for the air force to come here to hit certain <span
