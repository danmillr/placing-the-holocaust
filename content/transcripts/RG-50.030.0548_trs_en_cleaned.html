<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="246">Q: I see.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="248">A: There was nothing you could do.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Okay, okay.</sentence><sentence id="251">So let's go back, she has this address --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: So, she has this address, and she goes to this family, and they let her in, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was the more Protestant family.</sentence><sentence id="253">The sou-southern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was</sentence><sentence id="255">more Catholic, bordering <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">The northern part in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> was more Protestant, but there were also Catholic families, they just tended to have bigger families, I guess they didn't believe in birth control or whatever, they just tended to have bigger families.</sentence><sentence id="257">And that particular family also they had a bunch of daughters.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="264">There was about six kid -- five, six kids in the family, seven, whatever, I don't know exactly.</sentence><sentence id="265">And so my mother was 35 at that point, and they had a bunch of daughters all in their 30s, so my mother could blend in.</sentence><sentence id="266">My mother also did not look Jewish at all.</sentence><sentence id="267">My mother could easily have blended in.</sentence><sentence id="268">Some of the Catholics looked more Jewish than she did, so -- she was a little woman, she was slight, and she did no -- my friend here to see -- no, Mama, no, didn't look Jewish at all.</sentence><sentence id="269">So, she blended in.</sentence><sentence id="270">So they let her in, and while she was there, not very long, they said look, Annie, they're -- she went by the name Annie -- they said Annie, you know, we -- we want you to stay and you're welcome to stay with us, but you have to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the child, because our neighbors know that none of my daughters were pregnant, and when all of a sudden a baby cries, and a baby appeared, they know that something is up, and the baby will give us all away.</sentence><sentence id="271">And my mother realized, of course, they were right, and she certainly didn't want to jeopardize their life and her life and my life, so she set about finding a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me.</sentence><sentence id="272">And she really didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">But apparently, from what she told me, there was an org -- an underground organization</sentence><sentence id="275">consisting of doctors, nurses and medical students.</sentence><sentence id="276">And if you needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for a child, you could go there, and they would place the child.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="291">Q: But she didn't know them personally?</sentence><sentence id="292">She didn't know the [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="295">A: No, no, no, she just went to that organi -- it was an underground organization, like, you know, like anything.</sentence><sentence id="296">So, my mother went there and she said, I have a four months old that needs to be placed, do you have a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> for her?</sentence><sentence id="297">And they said, okay, on such and such a day, a couple will appear, and they will take your child away; they will take your child into hiding.</sentence><sentence id="298">And they tried to match up the couples with the ages.</sentence><sentence id="299">Like, if there was a teenager, they wouldn't give it a couple in their early 20s, that would look out of <span class="NPIP">place</span>, you didn't want to walk -- so, like I was four months old, so they gave me to a couple in their 20s.</sentence><sentence id="300">And my mother did, and --</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Must have been a tough day for her.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: And, as she describes, she packed my things, and she put a few special things in there, like a -- what do you call that thing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="311">Q: A rattle?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="313">A: A rattle.</sentence><sentence id="314">A special rattle and some other <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="315">And I had a little birthmark on my thigh, I think, but I don't have it any more, but I had that.</sentence><sentence id="316">And she figured if when the war is over, and she didn't -- nobody knew when it would be over, and a four months old, after a year you don't recognize your own child, she would ask for</sentence></p><p><sentence id="319">the things, at least she would be able to identify her own child.</sentence><sentence id="320">Which, by the way, is exactly what happened.</sentence><sentence id="321">And --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="322">Q: Smart lady.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="323">A: --I can just imagine my poor mother, two strangers come to the <span class="DLF">door</span>, and she handed me to two strangers, not knowing if she would ever see me again.</sentence><sentence id="324">In the beginning of the war from ol -- this is all what she told me, they would tell the parents where they took the children.</sentence><sentence id="325">The Nazis soon found out about that, and they would get the parents and torture them long enough that it would give away the address of the children.</sentence><sentence id="326">By the time I was hidden, my mother wasn't told anything.</sentence><sentence id="327">They wouldn't tell me wha -- what ci-ci -- what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> I went to, who I went to, where, she knew nothing, just handed me, and that was it.</sentence><sentence id="328">I was extraordinarily fortunate.</sentence><sentence id="329">Why?</sentence><sentence id="330">Because I came to a childless couple who were absolutely fantastic to me, who loved me dearly, who did everything and anything in their power to make things bearable...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="339">Q: We were talking about your foster parents.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="341">A: Yeah.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="343">Q: And -- and your luck.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: As I said, they were very -- they were a childless couple, extraordinarily nice to me, and what was my luck?</sentence><sentence id="349">Number one that they were childless.</sentence><sentence id="350">In a way that was very lucky because they put all their love and -- you know, devotion to me.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="354">Q: Yes?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="356">A: And for some reason, I stayed with them the whole war.</sentence><sentence id="357">They -- I guess we clicked.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="360">Q: So your earliest real memories would be of them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
