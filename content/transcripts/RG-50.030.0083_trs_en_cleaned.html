<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="52">Q: Tell me about some of your memories.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="54">A: As a child?</sentence><sentence id="55">Well, my memories were very, very good until L.... I was together with my family and with my neighbors and everybody else there.</sentence><sentence id="56">But then we were occupied by the Hungarians and a few years later we were occupied by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="57">So when the Germans came in, this is when I started seeing and feeling different things.</sentence><sentence id="58">Now the difference was that we weren't allowed to go out at night anymore.</sentence><sentence id="59">We weren't allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">shopping</span>, only at a certain time.</sentence><sentence id="60">But it didn't take long, maybe six weeks after the occupation by the Germans, that we were rounded up and we were taken to a...uh....<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="61">And that is to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uzhgorod</span> [Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U_horod</span>].</sentence><sentence id="62">That was the capital of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">Now that was something that was horrible in my life and actually what happened was maybe four weeks after the Germans were there, they took my brothers and my father away and they told us that they're going to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="64">You know, that they weren't going to be in the army, but they gonna be working.</sentence><sentence id="65">So my mother and, and us children--my grandparents were there--left.</sentence><sentence id="66">A few weeks later after they took my father and my two brothers away, this is when they rounded us up and...and took us to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> actually.</sentence><sentence id="67">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was, you know, we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span>, on concrete, but we had blankets that we took from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when we left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>.</sentence><sentence id="68">They ...uh...told us that we can...we've got to leave everything except only</sentence><sentence id="70">what we can take with ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="71">So I remember my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="72">He was...uh...a very old man.</sentence><sentence id="73">He was past 80.</sentence><sentence id="74">And he had a box...he had a Torah.</sentence><sentence id="75">I don't know how to explain it.</sentence><sentence id="76">The Ten Commandments or whatever...a Torah.</sentence><sentence id="77">And he did not want to leave it because he felt that wherever he is going to be, we will be needing it.</sentence><sentence id="78">How can we live without it?</sentence><sentence id="79">So, we had to deal with that.</sentence><sentence id="80">We...we wrapped that Torah up and we carried it with us. (</sentence><sentence id="81">Sigh) When we got to...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, the older people were using it.</sentence><sentence id="82">You know, they were still very religious and they felt that this Torah perhaps is going to save us or the world.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="114">Q: How did they carry the Torah?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="116">A: We carried it in...by...in our hands.</sentence><sentence id="117">You know we wrapped it up in sheets and whatever we had and we just carried it with us.</sentence><sentence id="118">But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>, every day it was somehow worse.</sentence><sentence id="119">Sometimes they wouldn't let us have water.</sentence><sentence id="120">Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and what we lived on is on soup.</sentence><sentence id="121">They gave us soup and...and bread.</sentence><sentence id="122">So that in itself was a horrible thing.</sentence><sentence id="123">But still you were with the family, especially me as a young adolescent.</sentence><sentence id="124">I wasn't paying much attention to that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: How old were you at this time?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: I was between 13 and 14 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="137">But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you know, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's got to report to a certain <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="138">And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with them.</sentence><sentence id="139">So my mother went along with him.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: With whom?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: With my grandfather.</sentence><sentence id="153">And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a...a prayer shawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it.</sentence><sentence id="154">So they made these men put on these _tallisen, these prayer shawls, and they told them to start praying.</sentence><sentence id="155">And while they were praying, they started beating on them and they started cutting their beards.</sentence><sentence id="156">So my poor grandfather... and my...my mother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his rescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...if you go near there.</sentence><sentence id="157">So this poor old man had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of the beard.</sentence><sentence id="158">And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard.</sentence><sentence id="159">So he continued crying for a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him.</sentence><sentence id="160">So she told...she gave him a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on his hat, you know.</sentence><sentence id="161">The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats.</sentence><sentence id="162">And that's how he walked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard.</sentence><sentence id="163">First of all, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to see himself.</sentence><sentence id="164">So we stood in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a few weeks and then when they got enough people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, for a full <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> load... It took about another six weeks to get these people together from all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence><sentence id="165">And they gave us...they lined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they told us they're relocating us.</sentence><sentence id="166">They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work.</sentence><sentence id="167">And they gave us a bucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, it was so packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person on...on him.</sentence><sentence id="168">So...then when we were packed into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> they locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and we stayed in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> until it...it was midnight and midnight the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started going.</sentence><sentence id="169">You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children.</sentence><sentence id="170">It was really,</sentence><sentence id="172">really chaotic there <span class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="173">We didn't know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="174">So it...you know, it was so noisy and it was so tense.</sentence><sentence id="175">I...[ don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of older people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill.</sentence><sentence id="176">So they were laying there with us.</sentence><sentence id="177">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, and we really didn't know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="178">The thing is that they...these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span>, they had <span class="DLF">windows</span> on top, small <span class="DLF">windows</span>.</sentence><sentence id="179">So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's shoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is.</sentence><sentence id="180">So as we were driving through the <span class="REGION">country side</span> I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see what's going...what's...what's going on there.</sentence><sentence id="181">And I saw the farmers showing to me like this (finger across throat).</sentence><sentence id="182">I...I really didn't know what they were saying.</sentence><sentence id="183">And...and a young adult it just didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something.</sentence><sentence id="184">But it was strange to see these farmers.</sentence><sentence id="185">They were all showing like this (finger across the throat).</sentence><sentence id="186">I told my sister.</sentence><sentence id="187">I told my mother that that's what they were showing me.</sentence><sentence id="188">Well, anyway when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> it sort of didn't sink in.</sentence><sentence id="189">I didn't expect that I was brought to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="190">I just didn't.</sentence><sentence id="191">But when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and they opened the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the SS with the dogs were standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a very big flame.</sentence><sentence id="192">And it smelled.</sentence><sentence id="193">It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something.</sentence><sentence id="194">And the SS were screaming, "Heraus!</sentence><sentence id="195">Heraus!</sentence><sentence id="196">Heraus!" "</sentence><sentence id="197">Get out!</sentence><sentence id="198">Get out!"</sentence><sentence id="199">Some of them were trying to go out and whoever couldn't go out, they were helping each other.</sentence><sentence id="200">Like my sister...I had two sisters coming with me.</sentence><sentence id="201">One was holding on to my grandmother because she was old and she couldn't walk very well, so she was trying to help her out.</sentence><sentence id="202">My mother was holding onto my brother and sort of trying to hold on to me to.</sentence><sentence id="203">But what they did is they pulled my brother away from her.</sentence><sentence id="204">They...they pushed my brother to the left and my mother and my other sister and me to the right.</sentence><sentence id="205">So my little brother noticed that my mother is going a different way so he started running after her and they started beating on him.</sentence><sentence id="206">And my mother</sentence><sentence id="208">heard his voice so she was...she looked back, so she was running back to my brother.</sentence><sentence id="209">And then they started beating on her.</sentence><sentence id="210">So she was pleading.</sentence><sentence id="211">She went on her knees pleading to that SS man to please let me go for this is my child and he won't be able to survive without me.</sentence><sentence id="212">He's so little.</sentence><sentence id="213">He was six years old.</sentence><sentence id="214">So after they beat her up, they pushed her to the left with my brother and there I remained with my sister.</sentence><sentence id="215">We were trying to run with my sister...my mother too but they wouldn't let us because when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> they already needed a manpower.</sentence><sentence id="216">Of course, at that time we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="217">So they wouldn't let us.</sentence><sentence id="218">And we looked pretty...you know, we looked pretty healthy yet.</sentence><sentence id="219">So they wouldn't let us run to my mother.</sentence><sentence id="220">So they started beating on us, on my sister and me.</sentence><sentence id="221">And my sister says to him, "You know, something smells terrible here."</sentence><sentence id="222">He says, "Well, we're just roasting pigs."</sentence><sentence id="223">And...uh...then you see these mothers coming down with little kids and they're...they're trying to pull these kids out of their mother's hands.</sentence><sentence id="224">And, you know, when you try to separate a family, it's very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="225">It's very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="226">People put up fights.</sentence><sentence id="227">It...it was so much screams.</sentence><sentence id="228">So there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="229">I remember that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="230">So the parents, the...the mothers that wouldn't give up these children and they were beaten up and the kids got hurt, so they grabbed these kids and they threw them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they really didn't look how they throwing them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span>.</sentence><sentence id="231">So at that time we saw that something horrible is happening the way these people were behaving to little children, to little babies.</sentence><sentence id="232">And, of course, on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> there were people, you know, very sick people going, you know, they were throwing sick people there and...and...and these children that gave them a tough time.</sentence><sentence id="233">They were just thrown on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>.</sentence><sentence id="234">And there were so many mothers that were running after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span>, and of course they beat them and they pushed them back.</sentence><sentence id="235">So that was the opening of these...of these <span class="DLF">train doors</span>.</sentence><sentence id="236">This is the first thing that I have seen there.</sentence><sentence id="237">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="332">Q: Go ahead.</sentence><sentence id="333">Keep talking.</sentence><sentence id="334">Tell..tell me more about...tell me more about what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="335">What happened with the--?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="340">A: Okay.</sentence><sentence id="341">Okay.</sentence><sentence id="342">So...uh...that...that big fire so maybe being that my sister and I was so young, it was like scary.</sentence><sentence id="343">It was...felt like you're going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fire</span>.</sentence><sentence id="344">And as we were walking, the people that worked there, they told us... they told us that they're gas...you know, they're...they're gassing more people than they can burn in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> so they had to...they have to burn them in the <span class="DLF">pits</span>.</sentence><sentence id="345">And we still...we thought that some person is just being cruel telling us that.</sentence><sentence id="346">So...and we walked, we walked, you know, they had a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of young people walking and as we were approaching these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there, there was...we heard music.</sentence><sentence id="347">There was a man is telling us that they are burning people because they can't burn them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="348">They can gas more than they can burn.</sentence><sentence id="349">And here we hear music!</sentence><sentence id="350">It was very, very confusing to us.</sentence><sentence id="351">When we got closer, our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span>...a...a... a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or whatever you want to call it, opened up and they told us to undress.</sentence><sentence id="352">And, of course, you know, the SS were walking around there and there was so many girls that didn't want to underess completely and they started beating on them and they had to get undressed.</sentence><sentence id="353">And then they started shaving our heads and...uh...1 remember staying there and these SS walking around us and if the girls would put down their heads, just trying to, just trying to hide, they would come up and they would take their whip and they would pull their heads up like this with the whip and they would look at us and then they would start whipping us.</sentence><sentence id="354">So we...we felt that there is something terrible going on but we didn't, still didn't think that maybe people are being put into a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> either.</sentence><sentence id="355">So then we took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they gave us a...uh...a striped dress and they gave us wooden clogs and that striped dress had a number.</sentence><sentence id="356">And that took place during the night.</sentence><sentence id="357">We kept on asking where's...where's my little brother.</sentence><sentence id="358">Where's</sentence><sentence id="360">my mother?</sentence><sentence id="361">Where's the rest of them?</sentence><sentence id="362">Because we thought we'll meet someplace.</sentence><sentence id="363">They didn't...you know we...they separated us right and left, my mother and my brother and my grandmother and my grandfather, my family went to the left and my sister and I were the only one from my family that I found myself with so we kept on asking each other where...where is the rest of them.</sentence><sentence id="364">Nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="365">Nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="366">Nobody knew.</sentence><sentence id="367">And then when they gave us the dress and they lined us up after a long, long time.</sentence><sentence id="368">You know, by the time they shaved a thousand girls" heads, it takes a long time.</sentence><sentence id="369">And...uh...it was...it was at night.</sentence><sentence id="370">I remember it was at night.</sentence><sentence id="371">And they let us into our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="372">They...you know, they took us to our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="373">When we got to that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>, there were, you know, like on the bottom there was three...uh...three different parts to that...to where we had to go and sit down or lay down.</sentence><sentence id="374">So I was on... remember, on top of that thing...on top of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> or whatever you would call it.</sentence><sentence id="375">And I would just sit there and my sister and we...we had...we were six girls to a <span class="NPIP">place</span>...uh...maybe that...that wide, and we would have to just lay there and we were just wondering what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="376">We just...we couldn't figure it out.</sentence><sentence id="377">So these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were made...they were made out of wood and there were cracks between them.</sentence><sentence id="378">So early in the morning they took us out around 4 o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="379">It was dark yet and I wasn't looking around too much.</sentence><sentence id="380">So they let us stay there for an hour and they were counting us and...uh...after they count us they told us we can go back in there.</sentence><sentence id="381">That was the first night.</sentence><sentence id="382">That was the first morning.</sentence><sentence id="383">When we got back in it was already about, you know, daylight and I took a look through the cracks and I saw people hanging on these <span class="DLF">wire fences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="384">It was such a terrible sight.</sentence><sentence id="385">I wasn't...I just wasn't prepared for all that.</sentence><sentence id="386">And I say to my sister, "Look what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="387">You know, look what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="388">People are...are hanging on these <span class="DLF">fences</span>.</sentence><sentence id="389">They're dead."</sentence><sentence id="390">They were got electrocuted because many of them...some of them were aware of the <span class="DLF">electric fences</span> and some of them thought maybe they want to escape or to go look for their parents or go look for their family.</sentence><sentence id="391">So they...they were hanging there.</sentence><sentence id="392">We were</sentence><sentence id="394">in all day.</sentence><sentence id="395">All day we were in.</sentence><sentence id="396">In the morning they gave us some soup and all day we were there and wondering what will happen.</sentence><sentence id="397">And, of course, we were locked in from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so there was no way to get out to see where we are, what's happening, what's going on because... because whatever happened, whatever they did with us, it was always during the night.</sentence><sentence id="398">So at night they...they brought in some bread and they gave us a slice of bread.</sentence><sentence id="399">And again during the night they were taking us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="400">It was also again a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="401">So we got to this <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> everybody in...

Finally, after a couple of days we wound up...it...it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="462">They took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and, again, we were walking from these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they took us in again to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but...but it was smaller.</sentence><sentence id="463">It was a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="464">It was a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="465">And they put us into these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> again and they gave us some soup.</sentence><sentence id="466">And the next day, again, they putting us out and they told us to get out again.</sentence><sentence id="467">For a hour we had to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> and they were counting us.</sentence><sentence id="468">And after that they gave us a slice of bread and some soup and they told us to march.</sentence><sentence id="469">We should go.</sentence><sentence id="470">And we...we marched and marched maybe for an hour and we got to a <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="471">When we got to the <span class="BUILDING">muniton factory</span>, they took these girls and placed them in different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="472">And they placed me near a... uh... near a...uh...like...it was like a pump, to pump the explosive into bombs.</sentence><sentence id="473">They were maybe [motioning] that tall.</sentence><sentence id="474">And I had to do it so fast that it was going with the machine and as the machine was working, I had to work with the machine.</sentence><sentence id="475">So, of course, in the beginning it was okay because I still wasn't that weakened.</sentence><sentence id="476">But after awhile, you know, the little bit of hair that we had became red from the poison,</sentence><sentence id="478">2 from that gunpowder.</sentence><sentence id="479">Our eyes were yellow.</sentence><sentence id="480">Our bodies were yellow.</sentence><sentence id="481">The reason why is because we worked night shifts and day shifts.</sentence><sentence id="482">So the night shift, and we worked the night shift, they closed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> so we had no circulation.</sentence><sentence id="483">So this poison was going into our system.</sentence><sentence id="484">When we worked during the day, it wasn't too bad because the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open.</sentence><sentence id="485">So there weren't that many girls that were falling, but during the night is when a lot of girls just fainted and just... just died because the body was full of poison.</sentence><sentence id="486">Well, anyway, we were working there for a few months.</sentence><sentence id="487">We got weakened and my sister...she's two years older.</sentence><sentence id="488">And at that time I just felt mentally that I can't go on anymore.</sentence><sentence id="489">Besides physically...1 was physically broken.</sentence><sentence id="490">So what she would do is she would give her slice of bread and she would...uh...she would say, "No, you're not gonna die.</sentence><sentence id="491">You're not gonna leave me here alone.</sentence><sentence id="492">Your not gonna die."</sentence><sentence id="493">She...uh ...she was like afraid of being alone.</sentence><sentence id="494">So...so I was trying to hold on to my life because I saw what she care...you know, the way she carried on.</sentence><sentence id="495">When we were walking back and forth to work...you know, it was an hour's walk, maybe more...and it was cold.</sentence><sentence id="496">So whenever we could pick up, like a rotten potato or something we would pick it up.</sentence><sentence id="497">Or if we would find paper...if we would find paper, we would put in into the...uh...into that dress that we had so that we should keep warm.</sentence><sentence id="498">And, of course, if we could find a rag on the <span class="DLF">road</span> sometimes, we would secretly want to pick it up and tie it to our clogs because at that time it was already snowing there in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and the clogs were falling off our feet and we ...if we wouldn't pick them up quick enough, then we would be walking barefooted.</sentence><sentence id="499">So...uh...1 remember one time...uh...we were walking on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew they were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and they let them wear the uniform.</sentence><sentence id="500">It's just that the buttons I remember were off.</sentence><sentence id="501">They had no buttons.</sentence><sentence id="502">And...uh... the men...they were...uh..., you know, big men with these big hats and we...we were trying to figure it out.</sentence><sentence id="503">We thought they were Russian.</sentence><sentence id="504">So...uh...believe me they</sentence><sentence id="506">3 looked like they suffered, but evidently what happened was they must have gotten more food than we did.</sentence><sentence id="507">So a French soldier threw some bread across the <span class="DLF">street</span> into our group.</sentence><sentence id="508">So the girl that was lucky was there and she picked it up, but the SS saw that she grabbed that bread and he started beating on her and beat on her and beat on her until she no longer could, you know, so she fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="509">And we just walked away, and we never saw her.</sentence><sentence id="510">But that would even happen if some girl would pick up...1 mean when we...when we wanted to pick up something from...that was laying on the <span class="DLF">road</span>, that... that would have to be like, you know, that the SS shouldn't see.</sentence><sentence id="511">You would have to look around and see because if they found you picking this up, you know, you were beaten up and it depended how strong you were whether you can take that beating or you can't.</sentence><sentence id="512">So...uh...and the girls were starting to get weak.</sentence><sentence id="513">You know, after...after awhile, you just can't take that punishment, the physical and the mental it's just...it's just you can't go on.</sentence><sentence id="514">We were there for a long, long time...for a long time going on.</sentence><sentence id="515">It was may...it was maybe 500 girls left at that time in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span>...in our...in our,...uh...you know, in our group.</sentence><sentence id="516">And as weaker as we were getting, we were trying to...we were trying to help each other sort of.</sentence><sentence id="517">So...the S...so the SS had one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> that the girls worked in...in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>, cooking for the SS people and us, we had another <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="518">It was, you know, cooked soup.</sentence><sentence id="519">So there was a girl in..in my...happened to be in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="520">She had a sister.</sentence><sentence id="521">She was lucky.</sentence><sentence id="522">She worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">SS kitchen</span> so, you know, she...she was surviving all right.</sentence><sentence id="523">But her sister wasn't surviving too well.</sentence><sentence id="524">So she sneaked some bread and brought it to her sister and they sort of...the Kapo caught her taking that bread to her sister.</sentence><sentence id="525">Well, they were both...both beaten up right there.</sentence><sentence id="526">And then they ordered all of us to come out and they took both of these girls and they hung them there on the gallows.</sentence><sentence id="527">I remember.</sentence><sentence id="528">L...I remember I still if | have nightmares, these faces come in front of me.</sentence><sentence id="529">If I think back on them I just, you know, I think they were trying so hard to survive and, therefore, they were punished.</sentence><sentence id="530">And they were so young.</sentence><sentence id="531">They were so young.</sentence><sentence id="532">And that was going on, but...uh....</sentence><sentence id="534">4 Excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="535">I don't want to do that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="741">A: I'll take a little bit of water.</sentence><sentence id="742">I feel we were still perhaps treated better than a lot of them because we worked...because we worked, but still, you know, after awhile you just can't take it.</sentence><sentence id="743">You know, you can't take it.</sentence><sentence id="744">So again, 1... couldn't get up in the morning anymore.</sentence><sentence id="745">And my sister would come and just literally stand me up because she knew that if I'll remain in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that I'll just disappear...that, you know, she'll never see me again.</sentence><sentence id="746">So she would stand me up and she would hold me up for the hour that we would have to stay <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the cold.</sentence><sentence id="747">It was so cold.</sentence><sentence id="748">And then she would drag me to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="749">She would actually drag me to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="750">And she would do her work and she would try to do my work.</sentence><sentence id="751">And...uh...it was...I just felt that I am not going to make it there in the end.</sentence><sentence id="752">But then all of a sudden, it was a long time.</sentence><sentence id="753">It was maybe nine months, a year, and we were already...we didn't look like people.</sentence><sentence id="754">We looked, you know, with...with deep red hair.</sentence><sentence id="755">I...It was like an orangey red hair.</sentence><sentence id="756">Our bodies were yellow.</sentence><sentence id="757">We were very skinny.</sentence><sentence id="758">I weighed maybe 70 pounds, 60

class="NPIP">inside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="764">They didn't take us to work.</sentence><sentence id="765">So what happened was they bombed.</sentence><sentence id="766">Every night when we were there, we were praying, praying they should bomb this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>, this <span class="BUILDING">munition factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="767">Even though we were there, they never let us out when the bombing was going on.</sentence><sentence id="768">They never let us out.</sentence><sentence id="769">They just locked the <span

go.</sentence><sentence id="772">But...uh...one day, it just so happened when we weren't there, that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was bombed.</sentence><sentence id="773">So that was the day when they gave us off.</sentence><sentence id="774">And next day they took us</sentence><sentence id="776">5 to...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that.</sentence><sentence id="777">They didn't tell us it was bombed.</sentence><sentence id="778">But they told us we won't...we won't be able to go there, but we're going to work someplace else.</sentence><sentence id="779">So they took us to work on a <span class="DLF">road</span>, to build a <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="780">Which was better because on a <span class="DLF">road</span> you were on the fresh air.</sentence><sentence id="781">And...uh ...you know, you tried doing as much as you can and even...you know, even if sometimes you got a...a...a whip, you could have, you know, you...you sort of overcome it faster than working constantly in this poisoned atmosphere.</sentence><sentence id="782">But still we worked on that <span class="DLF">road</span> maybe...uh...you know, a...a few months and again they locked us in.</sentence><sentence id="783">They locked us into this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span>.</sentence><sentence id="784">We were...we were very few

weren't needed there anymore and they're taking us to another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="794">So they put us on that open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and as I
