Jewish boys" school and myself being very eager uh to join him but that shouldn't happen though until after 1945 when we returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="4">Um, I don't remember much and I couldn't I imagine, of the actual German occupation but when it started rather.</sentence><sentence id="5">Uh the German occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> started . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="9">Q: Could we hold it?</sentence><sentence id="10">Let's ask a little more about your childhood only because people seeing this tape are not necessarily what traditional native Jewish family means.</sentence><sentence id="11">Uh, what for instance, uh, did you eat kosher at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence><sentence id="12">Did you light sabbath candles at <span class="BUILDING">home</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="17">A: Well, in uh in the early childhood, uh my parents didn't keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">Uh they did do it however later on when I, just after I was bar mitzvahed, uh they started keeping a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span>, and also my my mother would light the the sabbath candle.</sentence><sentence id="19">But we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> uh on the high holidays.</sentence><sentence id="20">Uh to please my grandparents I would once in a while go in on the sabbath also but that was really not the, uh something that happened too often.</sentence><sentence id="21">But my parents were very active in Jewish community life.</sentence><sentence id="22">In <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> my dad belonged to a number of Jewish organizations.</sentence><sentence id="23">He headed one of them and uh now if if only I can translate it properly - it would really correspond to what you would call a brotherhood here.</sentence><sentence id="24">Uh, it was meant as support organization where small independent un entrepreneurs, uh business people, tailors, etc.,</sentence><sentence id="25">what they, when in need they could loan money to get through a period of time.</sentence><sentence id="26">Then they would repay it.</sentence><sentence id="27">And it was often, it was all organized by this small organization which was quite powerful.</sentence><sentence id="28">And then at the same time the organization also got involved in the promotion of Yiddish culture.</sentence><sentence id="29">Uh they would stage uh performances when there were uh uh Yiddish actors visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, etc.</sentence><sentence id="30">Um, now there were at that time and there still are quite a number of Jewish associations in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, in spite of the fact of course that the community was and is rather small.</sentence><sentence id="31">Uh today the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> is about the same size as it was before the Second World War.</sentence><sentence id="32">Uh just around 7,000 people.</sentence><sentence id="33">And uh at that time there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish boys school</span> and there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish girls school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="34">Now they've been, uh after the war they were combined into one.</sentence><sentence id="35">And it takes the kids up through uh <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span>, through <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span>, but then for further education, uh the kids have to attend the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> or other <span class="BUILDING">private schools</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="55">Q: You were very young.</sentence><sentence id="56">Did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> of some kind?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="59">A: Yes, I did go to the new Jewish uh <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> which was located the same place as the <span class="BUILDING">girls" school</span> was at that time.</sentence><sentence id="60">Uh, I remember going to the uh <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>, mostly because I hated it when I was forced to take an afternoon nap.</sentence><sentence id="61">But uh I do remember some of the things that happened at at the <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>, where we were taught uh things that perhaps you wouldn't be teaching in <span class="BUILDING">Christian schools</span> in the sense that uh - well the old Jewish tradition of putting such great emphasis on children's education.</sentence><sentence id="62">Uh now I can mention here that the <span class="BUILDING">boys" school</span> took in uh the boys already at the age of five and started teaching them proper Danish etc.</sentence><sentence id="63">etc.</sentence><sentence id="64">Uh where as <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> only took in uh students at the age of seven.</sentence><sentence id="65">So also in the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span>, at the age of four or uh, you would be, uh they would start teaching you uh proper subjects.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="73">Q: What did they teach you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="75">A: Well, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="76">It's it's difficult today to say what I learned at the age of three, four and five or, but uh, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="77">Honestly I can't specify.</sentence><sentence id="78">I couldn't. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="83">Q: You probably sang songs . . .?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="85">A: Exactly, exactly.</sentence><sentence id="86">We learned how to spell.</sentence><sentence id="87">We learned the letters and that kind of uh stuff.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: What about outside of <span class="BUILDING">school</span>?</sentence><sentence id="92">Uh, what, your playmates, were they all Jewish?</sentence><sentence id="93">Was it a mixed group?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="97">A: It was definitely a mixed group.</sentence><sentence id="98">Definitely.</sentence><sentence id="99">And this was very typical of a Jewish family at that time and even today in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> because Jews have lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> since the 17th century.</sentence><sentence id="100">Uh during the early part of the 17th century the then king who was King Christian IV, declared a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, in the southern part of (ph), an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and that was, for good reasons he needed to have people come in and help finance his various wars, and uh he also uh wanted to what at that time must have been called industrialize the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so he took in people who knew about tobacco trade and tobacco manufacture.</sentence><sentence id="101">And uh, well the the Danish Jewish population really originated at that time but of course there was a big influx or/and revitalization of the Jewish community in the early part of this century when at the time my grandparents came in, there was a big immigration from <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> because of the pogroms in uh uh <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and uh the <span class="REGION">Baltic States</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="102">Now...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: So that then affected the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Well, it did uh and from what I've read, you know, there there were not always agreements between the different type of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">There were the old established Danish Jewish communities who had ancestors living in in in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> for perhaps up to 200 years or more, and then there were these new immigrants.</sentence><sentence id="113">And uh from what I've heard my parents tell at least, uh there was quite a distinction made between the two groups of Jews during the early part of this century but but of course this is a distinction which doesn't exist any more.</sentence><sentence id="114">Uh, now the Jewish population remained relatively stable uh between the wars but uh after the war there was some immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="115">And also uh there was a general Danish immigration although on a small scale to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and among them were some Danish Jews who went over there.</sentence><sentence id="116">There were some Danes who, uh Danish Jews who stayed on in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> after the end of the Danish or uh German occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="117">So the population the Jewish population in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> after the war, let's say in the late "40's, went down to about 5,000, 5,500.</sentence><sentence id="118">But then in the late "60's, as a result of the unrest and the difficulties in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, there was a new influx of Polish Jewish immigrants.</sentence><sentence id="119">Uh, a couple of thousand came in uh just around 1970.</sentence><sentence id="120">And now forms of course an integral part of the Jewish community.</sentence><sentence id="121">But again, uh you asked about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> - did I play with with uh non-Jews as well as Jews, etc.</sentence><sentence id="122">And and I said I certainly did.</sentence><sentence id="123">And this again has to do with the fact that although the Jewish population has received new waves of immigrants through the uh but not waves, but a few times this has happened, the Jewish population in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> has always been very much assimilated.</sentence><sentence id="124">Uh, when you speak about Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> you you don't classify them as such, as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="125">You classify them as Danes of Jewish extraction or Jewish religion or Jewish family.</sentence><sentence id="126">You don't distinguish between groups whether a person is a Catholic or Jewish or he is uh Lutheran or he's an atheist.</sentence><sentence id="127">Uh, this could be due to the fact also that the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> has for centuries not really been powerful.</sentence><sentence id="128">You know, something like 90- odd percent of the Danish population belongs to the <span class="BUILDING">State church</span> which is the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran Church</span>.</sentence><sentence id="129">But if you look at <span class="BUILDING">church</span> attendance in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, it's down to a few percent.</sentence><sentence id="130">So, this has to do with the fact that that you don't you don't feel that there is a difference between, when as a kid, playing with uh Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends.</sentence><sentence id="131">I I guess that to go on from there, there weren't anti-Semitists.</sentence><sentence id="132">There really hasn't, for a long, long time, has had no real meaning in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="133">Uh, what perhaps could be percei... uh conceived as anti- Semitism, anti-Semitism, in the sense that there's a word - to steal, from old, old Danish or northern which is called "to Jew" something.</sentence><sentence id="134">The person using that word, the non- Jew using that word, is not associating with something being Jewish, but it's an old, old word that was adopted in the language.</sentence><sentence id="135">You hear it very, very seldom today.</sentence><sentence id="136">I heard it as a kid, and I would react.</sentence><sentence id="137">But uh I feel confident that it was not, when the person used it about another person, it was not really to classify in an ethnic group.</sentence><sentence id="138">It was more that the word had become common usage and I think also that the events during the 2nd World War proved uh beyond any doubt that there is no basis for anti-Semitism in a society like the Danish, or in a north European environment.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="167">Q: Thank you.</sentence><sentence id="168">Let's take it back.</sentence><sentence id="169">You have grown up in this family, playing with other kids, Jewish and non-Jewish, what have you.</sentence><sentence id="170">You've been going to this <span class="BUILDING">boys school</span>, <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="171">Uh, but life changed.</sentence><sentence id="172">Life changed presumably when the Germans came in, or did it?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="179">Tell us what happened when the Germans first came.</sentence><sentence id="180">How did it affect your life, or did it affect your life?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="181">A: I don't think it did in the beginning. (</sentence><sentence id="182">OK) Uh, now you must remember that when the Germans came in and occupied Denmark the uh, on April 9, 1940, the Germans didn't call it an occupation.</sentence><sentence id="183">They came to support <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> against an attack from the Allied forces and quite openly they also came to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in order to secure their own passage up to <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="184">Uh, when the Germans crossed the <span class="DLF">Danish borders</span> in the early morning of April 9, 1940, there was a little armed resistance but the govern... the then-government and the then-king uh decided very fast to stop resistance simply because it was so evident it was an impossible task to stop the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="185">Uh, it would mean an incredible bloodshed if a serious effort was made to stop the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="186">So instead the Danish government decided to see if they could have a, if they could carry out negotiations with the Germans in order to reduce the German's, the German influence in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, while <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was being occupied by them.</sentence><sentence id="187">And in in the beginning it seemed that it was possible.</sentence><sentence id="188">The Danish government stayed on as a government.</sentence><sentence id="189">The Danish police force was allowed to continue.</sentence><sentence id="190">Uh the Danish army as such was disbanded and so was the uh the navy, but the police force remained the controlling uh force in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and of the many, no, let me put it another way - uh of course there was a lot of give and take between the Germans and the Danes at that time on on an official level.</sentence><sentence id="191">But one of the things that was made abundantly clear to the Germans was that the Danes would never accept the execution of the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="192">The Jewish issue was not an issue in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, and would not be.</sentence><sentence id="193">The government could not tolerate that it be made an issue.</sentence><sentence id="194">And this was respected by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="195">Uh, I don't remember much from the first few years of the war.</sentence><sentence id="196">Uh the clearest impact was from just a month before, when we speak about the war I mean, there were a lot of things from my childhood, but but this also actually goes to to to indicate that the changes in the daily life were not that many.</sentence><sentence id="197">But I remember clearly on August the 28th, 1943, uh we had our annual family tour of the <span class="DLF">Tivoli Gardens</span>.</sentence><sentence id="198">The <span class="DLF">Tivoli Gardens</span> are something completely unique for <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> - it's an <span class="DLF">amusement park</span>; it's a <span class="DLF">flower garden</span>; it's got 23 <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span>; and it's right smack in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>; and it, there is no entertainment or <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> in the world like it.</sentence><sentence id="199">I'm Dane and I'm proud of it and I'll insist there's nothing like it.</sentence><sentence id="200">And for a kid being taken to the <span class="DLF">Tivoli Garden</span> was usually the highlight of the summer season and we had been in, was normally once during the, early part of the season which starts in, around the first of May and then one the late uh part of the season.</sentence><sentence id="201">And I remember clearly that evening on the uh August the 29, I'm sorry - August 28, 1943, when leaving the <span class="DLF">Gardens</span> there was a crowd in the <span class="DLF">street</span> looking on as an enormous convoy of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> rode through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="202">Of course, as a kid, I didn't know that the cause of it was that it had come to an impasse between the Danish government and the German occupation forces.</sentence><sentence id="203">And on the following day the pow... the Danish government stepped down, refused to cooperate with the Germans any longer.</sentence><sentence id="204">And the Police Corps, the Danish police force uh was disbanded at, rather they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span>, a large number of the Danish police.</sentence><sentence id="205">But this I guess is one of the early, of earliest clear memories I have from the war.</sentence><sentence id="206">But there's another, there's another memory which perhaps, I don't know - I think it's actually half a year or year earlier - uh being called out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> by my elder brother in early evening to see a fantastic red hue over the evening sky and that turned out to be a sabotage, the effect of a sabotage of I think the <span class="BUILDING">Danish sugar factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="207">So that they shouldn't be supplying to the German troops.</sentence><sentence id="208">And you could see simply the fire lighting off the evening sky.</sentence><sentence id="209">It could have been half a year earlier but I'm not, I'm not completely sure of the of the date of that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="239">Q: Did your brother later tell you what this was?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="241">A: No, I 1 remember, I I remember having heard, hearing these are the <span class="BUILDING">sugar factories</span> going up.</sentence><sentence id="242">I remember that.</sentence><sentence id="243">Uh, then uh I remember after August 29, 1943, which was really the crucial day in the occupation history, the German occupation history of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, because uh I think to a large extent the Danish population wanted to disassociate themselves completely from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="244">Uh now one shouldn't forget that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for more than 100 years - that's not quite true - let's say from 1849 - has always been considered the big brother down south.</sentence><sentence id="245">We had, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> had wars against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1849 - we were lucky at that time - there were some other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> that helped us beat the Germans, but in 1864 we were severely beaten and part of the Danish, <span class="REGION">southern Danish territory</span> was taken away from them and and taken over by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">Part of that <span class="REGION">territory</span> was was given back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> after the 1st World War in 1919, but there's always been an an apprehension against these very very powerful Germans just south of the <span class="DLF">border</span>.</sentence><sentence id="247">So to go back to to August 29, 1943, I think for a large part of the population, there was a bit of an urgency to disassociate themselves from the Germans and they, I think many of them heaved a sigh of relief that finally the Danish government refused to further cooperation.</sentence><sentence id="248">Uh everybody knew I guess, I'm speaking about the adults, everybody knew no doubt that it would mean uh hardships because now the Germans were in total power, total control.</sentence><sentence id="249">But uh on the other hand uh people couldn't accept uh how the Germans were behaving in Europe and such because although the press was completely censored and controlled by the Germans - one shouldn't forget that the BBC was broadcasting all the time and although of course it was under strict penalty to listen to BBC everybody did it.</sentence><sentence id="250">And information about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and what had happened to minority groups, what was happening to minority groups, as to all the Jews in Europe, had started to had started to come up to their <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>.</sentence><sentence id="251">And...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="263">Q: What was, excuse me.</sentence><sentence id="264">What was the atmosphere of your family at this time, after the 29th?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="267">A: After the 29th, very much an atmosphere of apprehension, that uh something bad could happen and that we should be prepared for it and that perhaps we would have to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="268">This did happen, the talk about that, during the month of uh September.</sentence><sentence id="269">And now the whole atmosphere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="55.6694544" long="12.5893558">Copenhagen</span> changed very much uh because there was a curfew on after the 29th of August and you could feel that things were not going the right way.</sentence><sentence id="270">I think that even a kid at that time could feel it, and perhaps what the kid could feel most was the apprehension of his parents.</sentence><sentence id="271">And all the elders.</sentence><sentence id="272">Uh, but still I would say that when it happened, that day that my dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the early afternoon, and he usually worked very very hard - uh leave very early in the morning and come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> rather late - but when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said, pack up your or rather don't pack up your things, because we're not going to take any luggage, but put on as many clothes as you could possibly have on you without being very conspicuous uh - it did come as a surprise that we had to leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="273">And that was on, let's see now, September 30th, 1943.</sentence><sentence id="274">That means that it was actually the day before the you you might perhaps have heard that there was a warning issued to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and that was on October Ist.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="283">Q: Were you in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and did you hear ...?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="285">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="286">Because we heard it the day the day before and that had to do with the fact that my dad was so much involved in community work uh in uh within the Jewish associations, etc.etc.</sentence><sentence id="287">Uh but it was only the following day that the warning was issued from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="292">Q: You heard it the day before?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="293">A: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="294">Q: Your father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said you had to leave?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="296">A: That's right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="298">Q: What did you do?</sentence></p></dialogue>
