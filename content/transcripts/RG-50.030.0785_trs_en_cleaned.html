<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="214">Q: So, in other words, you lived on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="215">A: On -- on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> -- no, the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was attached, or the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was built on a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, because every owner had a lot behind the <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, let's say, you know, a lot of <span class="REGION">area</span>, where they would raise grain, and -- and cabbage and potatoes.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: You know, one of the reasons I focus on this, is because it's -- it is in some ways unusual for people to -- it doesn't sound like you lived in the middle of an <span class="NPIP">agricultural place</span>, insofar as you had a <span class="DLF">street</span>, you had both <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the side of the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="218"><span class="DLF">street</span>, and -- and it 1 -- sounds almost like a small residential area, but not a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that's a farm area.</sentence><sentence id="219">And -- and --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="220">A: Yes, some of those habitants, or the people who lived there, were of German extraction.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="222">Q: Oh, really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="224">A: Yes, so it -- it -- it was even referred like a German colony.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="226">Q: Really?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="228">A: Yes, because there were Polish people, and some German people were living in there, so the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> I can recollect, were <span class="BUILDING">brick buildings</span>, and pretty substantial, let's say, you know, there's -- they not dilapidated or anything like that, it was -- I think it was a fairly new colony.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="288">A: M-Most of people probably came from different areas, from around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span>, because I think it was a fairly new settlement, let's say, like outside of this larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wola Zarezycka</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
