<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="65">Q: Had you seen combat in Europe?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="67">A: Yes, I saw combat.</sentence><sentence id="68">I got into -- I was in the Normandy landings on the day after D-Day -- I -- after D-Day on -- on June seventh.</sentence><sentence id="69">I was up on the <span class="DLF">beach</span>, and my duties then were, again, I--I had a -- an interrogation team and we were interrogating prisoners of war.</sentence><sentence id="70">But under the -- at that point, of course, it was combat.</sentence><sentence id="71">It was combat and interrogating and shooting some more and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="72">Everybody was in combat then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="79">Q: On your way through Europe, did you -- did you encounter any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that had just been liberated?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="81">A: Through Europe?</sentence><sentence id="82">Yes, the only one that I encountered on the way through the -- in the campaign was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp Nordhausen</span>, which we came upon not knowing where we -- that there was a concentration until we -- til we ran into it.</sentence><sentence id="83">It was a -- it was a horrible experience.</sentence><sentence id="84">Knowing that my parents must be in one of those, I -- I sort of instinctively started looking around to see if I could see my parents.</sentence><sentence id="85">It wa -- it was a -- an impression that stayed with me for a long time.</sentence><sentence id="86">It was the -- bodies lying around, people wandering around in a daze.</sentence><sentence id="87">We tried</sentence><sentence id="89">Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 to, the little time that we had, we were moving pretty fast at the time, chasing the rest of the Germans in the direction of the -- of the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="90">And we were there for about a day or two, I did interrogate some of the guards.</sentence><sentence id="91">They -- some of them, as I recall, were Ukrainian guards that the survivors of -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> many of them by the way in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.535477" long="10.748686">Nordhausen</span> w-was one of the camps that had a lot of slave labors from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span>, a lot of Yugoslavs that I encountered there.</sentence><sentence id="92">They wanted those guards.</sentence><sentence id="93">And if I lost any of them on the way, I -- I-I can't remember.</sentence><sentence id="94">But they -- the guards were scared.</sentence><sentence id="95">I recall one guard, who absolutely refused to talk.</sentence><sentence id="96">And we had ways of, you know, interrogate -- ways of interrogate -- this -- this was not a friendly interrogation, so we made them talk.</sentence><sentence id="97">Not by physical force in any way, but by -- oh, various things.</sentence><sentence id="98">Like we have him take off his clothes.</sentence><sentence id="99">And when a man stands there in front of you without his clothes on, he'II start talking pretty soon, we found out.</sentence><sentence id="100">That's an interesting thing we learned over -- over the -- we sort of picked up as we went through the war and -- interrogation techniques that they didn't teach us in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="101">But he f-- he talked and I got -- I got his story, of course, I can't remember the details now.</sentence><sentence id="102">But I did get a-- the story of some of the atrocities that the -- they were -- they committed.</sentence><sentence id="103">I turned the people over -- the -- the guards over to the military police that picked them up and took them back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="134">Q: The guards that you said you -- if you misplaced them along the way, you -- you don't remember, do you know what happened to those guards?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="136">A: No, I don't.</sentence><sentence id="137">I have no idea.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="140">Q: You also said that you employed techniques that you didn't learn in <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">Can you tell me a little bit about your training in -- in some of the techniques that you were trained to use and some of the ones you learned along the way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="144">A: Yes, well, in the military I was -- I was -- I went to -- I was originally in field artillery.</sentence><sentence id="145">I went to <span class="BUILDING">officer candidate school</span> and became -- I was an artillery officer.</sentence><sentence id="146">And then I was, shortly after graduation at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Sill</span>, <span class="REGION">Oklahoma</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">artillery school</span> was, I was tapped for intelligence because of my background in languages and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="147">I was called one night -- one evening I was called in and was told that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, in quotes, at that time wanted me to go to -- wanted me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">intelligence school</span>, which was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ritchie</span>, right in-- in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> here, then called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Ritchie</span>.</sentence><sentence id="148">That was the <span class="BUILDING">military intelligence school</span> and we went through interrogation training and all kinds of intelligence training.</sentence><sentence id="149">Oh, we learned all kinds of things like Morse code, which I have never used in my life.</sentence><sentence id="150">Don't know anybody who ever did, and folder interpretation, map reading of foreign maps, which was important because some of the captured maps we had to -- to know what we saw, and we had all kinds of field training with those.</sentence><sentence id="151">These were</sentence><sentence id="153">Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 Maryland -- Maryland maps, maps of the -- of the <span class="REGION">Ritchie area</span>, but printed in various languages including Japanese.</sentence><sentence id="154">I remember one night that they dropped me off someplace at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and gave me this -- this map.</sentence><sentence id="155">And from landmarks and all that, you identified where you were and which way you were going.</sentence><sentence id="156">Well, that was important but in -- basically for me that was not a problem because I was fluent in German, of course, my native language, I also knew French.</sentence><sentence id="157">And that's the direction we went in, so once we got there, I could easily read those maps if-- if necessary.</sentence><sentence id="158">We were trained in order of battle, identifying -- we learned everything about the German -- we knew more about the German army, their uniforms, their -- their insignia.</sentence><sentence id="159">That was all part of -- of the training and the units, the organization of the German army, what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> looked like, what they were, how ba -- how strong they were, etcetera.</sentence><sentence id="160">That was all part of it because that was all part of -- of the interrogation process.</sentence><sentence id="161">And so when we -- when I got into -- to the combat are -- zone, interrogating the people was simple.</sentence><sentence id="162">One thing, for example, was that every German had what was called a soldbuch, a paybook.</sentence><sentence id="163">Now that soldbuch -- soldbuch had all his military a-assignments listed in there.</sentence><sentence id="164">And it was easy to figure out who he was and what he was.</sentence><sentence id="165">So the first thing we'd ask them is, give me your <span class="BUILDING">soldbuch</span>.</sentence><sentence id="166">And they would hand it over and you had them right there, that was -- now you knew.</sentence><sentence id="167">And so then you would say, oh you were from the 338"</sentence><sentence id="169">Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 Fiisilier-Batallion(ph), yeah?</sentence><sentence id="170">And he'd say yeah, and take it from there.</sentence><sentence id="171">Most of the interrogations were actually not difficult.</sentence><sentence id="172">Most of them talked.</sentence><sentence id="173">Now you ran into some, officers mainly, who said name, rank and serial number, that's all they would give you.</sentence><sentence id="174">But again, you -- we -- all of us, I think, found ways to -- to break them.</sentence><sentence id="175">For example is one thing, a German, regardless of whether you were friend or enemy, respected rank.</sentence><sentence id="176">So you made sure that the insignia you were -- you were wearing at the time, and we had a complete collection of it, were at least one rank higher than the man we had, and we could read that.</sentence><sentence id="177">So we -- we played that game, it was -- if you had time for it.</sentence><sentence id="178">Now a lot of -- most of it was right up in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, so you didn't have time to -- to play games.</sentence><sentence id="179">And at those times we would just play tough, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="180">Threaten, all kinds of things, you know, we would -- we -- we'd say -- we'd tell them, okay, we'll let you walk back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, right through the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="181">Of course they wouldn't do that cause they'd get shot.</sentence><sentence id="182">And things like that, and they would -- I don't really recall anyone I could not break in an -- in an interrogation, and I've interrogated thousands of them.</sentence><sentence id="183">Now, what we did with the information, and we -- we -- in my case, being in the <span class="DLF">front lines</span>, I would -- my targets were who was opposing us, how strong are they, where are they located, what kind of weapons do they have, where's their artillery.</sentence><sentence id="184">And I would immediately call in to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">artillery</span> to give them the coordinate of <span class="NPIP">locations</span> so that they</sentence><sentence id="186">could fire on it, and my infantry units that I supported would get all the information -- the -- the intelligence officer of the unit would get all the information that was relevant to who -- who was on the other side of the <span class="DLF">line</span>, what was their morale, how -- how strong were they, what kind of weapons did they have.</sentence><sentence id="187">And that went -- well, we had a lot of good results.</sentence><sentence id="188">One of the things that I and my team always did was when we had specific targets that we could identify, after we had pushed through the <span class="REGION">area</span> we checked those targets to make su -- to see if they had been hit like we -- and I think most of them were.</sentence><sentence id="189">So, it was -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> it was -- is rough, cause we were going from <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span> to <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span>, you know, one <span class="DLF">hedgerow</span> at a time, and you know, a hundred -- a hundred yards a day, things like that.</sentence><sentence id="190">But after that, of course, on the run, that was a little different.</sentence><sentence id="191">Once we broke through, it was -- it was a different story, it was easier then.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="240">Q: You mentioned in your interview for the Shoah Foundation that British intelligence was superior to American intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="241">Can you clarify that point for me?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Yes, I--I went to --I was shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in December of 1943.</sentence><sentence id="245">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> until -- until D-Day, so that was six months from -- in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="246">And at the time I was sent to -- from where we were out in the near -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> somewhere, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to study with -- with British intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="247">They</sentence><sentence id="249">had some <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and they -- they took us into -- and gave us some -- some information.</sentence><sentence id="250">The British had a lot more experience.</sentence><sentence id="251">We had absolutely no experience, we were new.</sentence><sentence id="252">We were -- all of -- not -- I'm not just talking about the -- the <span class="DLF">front line</span> type intelligence, but the OSS didn't exist until just about that time.</sentence><sentence id="253">And they had never, the people in the OSS were not what the British had trained for years and years as intelligence officers.</sentence><sentence id="254">We all learned fr -- by -- by doing.</sentence><sentence id="255">The -- I had some contact with OSS people afte -- on -- well, on -- actually still in Europe, but on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="256">They were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the same time, and I listened to some of their stories.</sentence><sentence id="257">They were dropped -- one particular I remember, who was an artist, or at least that is what he -- he faked.</sentence><sentence id="258">He was of Italian descent, a New Yorker who spoke Italian.</sentence><sentence id="259">He was dropped into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and he sat around painting.</sentence><sentence id="260">He was -- to the Germans he was an Italian painter visiting here, and was friendly right, to -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was a friendly <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="261">And that's the way he collected intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="262">But he said he had absolutely no idea what he was doing when he first got in there.</sentence><sentence id="263">He got in by parachute, got -- the French helped him -- French underground helped him.</sentence><sentence id="264">And then he -- he sat aro -- he tha -- he started painting and reporting and they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">equipment</span> to -- to report.</sentence><sentence id="265">And he was around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> and the Sherbrooke(ph) peninsula doing this artwork.</sentence><sentence id="266">Course na -- he brought nothing <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="267">He all gave that to -- to his French comrades there.</sentence><sentence id="268">But again, no</sentence><sentence id="270">Interview with Charles Stein 0 June 8, 1999 experience.</sentence><sentence id="271">Everything was -- whatever we did was done for the first time, on the <span class="REGION">U.S. side</span>.</sentence><sentence id="272">And now, as I said, the British, of course, had been doing their in- intelligence work, collection of intelligence all over the world with the -- with the <span class="REGION">colonies</span> and all that.</sentence><sentence id="273">So -- a-and in World War II, of course, they'd been in the war for three years before we came in, or almost three years.</sentence><sentence id="274">That was wa-why I said that their -- their intelligence was better, they were better organized.</sentence><sentence id="275">We were just learning, but we got there.</sentence><sentence id="276">We -- just like everything else, I think, in the -- in the U.S. Army.</sentence><sentence id="277">That army had absolutely no experience, we came from all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">Nobody -- there were no real soldiers at th-- in 1941.</sentence><sentence id="279">By 1944 we did the -- the biggest -- biggest job ever done in any -- any invasion.</sentence><sentence id="280">And it was successful.</sentence><sentence id="281">So I guess as Americans, we're -- we're quick learners.</sentence><sentence id="282">We picked up an awful lot from the British.</sentence><sentence id="283">They were very helpful.</sentence><sentence id="284">They taught us then.</sentence><sentence id="285">The <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that I went to in-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during that period were very informative, because we talked to people who had been there, who had been there, done that and told us how -- how they did whatever we were doing later on.</sentence><sentence id="286">That's -- that's about -- that's about it for -- on that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="330">Q: You mentioned that you learned some things on your own and you were successful in -- in your interrogations.</sentence><sentence id="331">And you mentioned one thing that they didn't teach you was to have your prisoner --</sentence><sentence id="333">Interview with Charles Stein 8 June 8, 1999</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="334">A: Strip.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="335">Q: -- get undressed, right.</sentence><sentence id="336">What other kind of things did you improvise?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="339">A: Well, there are -- there were -- for example, the -- the -- what they didn't teach us, they taught us that e-every soldier has a soldbuch, but didn't tell us what to do with it.</sentence><sentence id="340">That is we picked up ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="341">I -- I picked up the first one I looked at and I said, there it is.</sentence><sentence id="342">And I asked the man ha -- you were up with -- I told him, I didn't ask him, I told him, you were up from this and this regiment, or this -- and they said yes.</sentence><sentence id="343">And before that you were something else.</sentence><sentence id="344">One of the things that we did was when -- when time allowed, was engage in some small talk.</sentence><sentence id="345">Small talk about, well, you got your family back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, and that would open up suddenly, and then you lead into other things.</sentence><sentence id="346">I had some interesting interrogations.</sentence><sentence id="347">I had -- and this is -- this is one in a-- in a--ina billion, probably.</sentence><sentence id="348">Had a prisoner, this -- we were about -- we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time.</sentence><sentence id="349">And he had very little information, but he was willing to talk.</sentence><sentence id="350">He said tha -- actually, he deserted he told me.</sentence><sentence id="351">I'm not sure that that was right, but it didn't matter.</sentence><sentence id="352">But I noticed in papers that he had on him that he was a medical student at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Vienna</span>.</sentence><sentence id="353">And so I asked him a -- whether he was -- took anatomy from Professor Bernkopf(ph) Versowzer(ph) and his mouth opened and he se -- di-di-ta-ba -- how -- but how did you know?</sentence><sentence id="354">I said, ""m an intelligence officer, I know everything.</sentence><sentence id="355">And he just couldn't understand why,</sentence><sentence id="357">4 and then he started opening up and told me all kinds of things about what happened to his family and others.</sentence><sentence id="358">His mother-in-law was mentally incompetent and she was in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in a place that was known to me, that was the insane asylum in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span>, there was one big one.</sentence><sentence id="359">And she had been killed, and he told me that they were killing these -- well, handicapped people, mentally handicapped.</sentence><sentence id="360">They didn't need them, so they killed them.</sentence><sentence id="361">And you know, he was mad and so he said he deserted.</sentence><sentence id="362">Well, took him a long time to <span class="DLF">desert</span>.</sentence><sentence id="363">But th -- it-it's that kind of thing that -- that those are interesting little things that happened.</sentence><sentence id="364">There were many of them, of the different nature.</sentence><sentence id="365">For example, in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit I was with was holding one of the -- you know, the corners of -- of the thing.</sentence><sentence id="366">We were not penetrated, but we -- we -- we went in there to hold it, and that was in the famous Battle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hiirtgen Forest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="367">And there was a German lieutenant colonel in there with his troops, holding out.</sentence><sentence id="368">And we could -- it's a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dense forest</span> and we just couldn't get him out.</sentence><sentence id="369">And one day one of -- a couple of Germans came out with a white flag and said that they're currently -- name I -- I can't remember the name, but it was a rather, later on, well known in -- in -- in the history of the war.</sentence><sentence id="370">What was his name?Well, can't remember.</sentence><sentence id="371">Anyhow, so who was sent in to bring -- yeah, he was sick.</sentence><sentence id="372">He was very sick and he wanted to surrender.</sentence><sentence id="373">And so who was sent in to bring him out, of course?</sentence><sentence id="374">The only one who spoke German.</sentence><sentence id="375">And in I went and I got him out</sentence><sentence id="377">and we had -- the man had pneumonia very badly.</sentence><sentence id="378">But -- and, you know, interrogating him at this point was really not necessary.</sentence><sentence id="379">There was nothing he could tell us in the -- in the present situation.</sentence><sentence id="380">But he was on his own, just started talking as we carried him out.</sentence><sentence id="381">His own men carried him on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>.</sentence><sentence id="382">And we came out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and then we waited until he was evacuated.</sentence><sentence id="383">And he just told us all kinds of war stories, was just great.</sentence><sentence id="384">Good information.</sentence><sentence id="385">Not necessarily tactical information, but strategically important of how decisions were made and all that.</sentence><sentence id="386">Well, we took that down and got it back to higher <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and I don't know what they did with it, but at least the information was there.</sentence><sentence id="387">So

said maybe I ought to do -- make a little money, I had none.</sentence><sentence id="640">I had whatever I had saved from my army pay, which wasn't very much.</sentence><sentence id="641">I wasn't working, I had not found a way to -- to do anything and so I said why, why don't I do something else first?</sentence><sentence id="642">So I--I dropped <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and I dropped medicine and I went into the <span class="BUILDING">export business</span>.</sentence><sentence id="643">Opened my own busin -- I took -- well, first of all I had to learn something about the

good</sentence><sentence id="651"><span class="NPIP">place</span> to do, and we did.</sentence><sentence id="652">Went into business, we -- we got in contact with some manufacturers of <span

id="653">And we started writing let -- by that time, by the way, I had taken, soon as it came back, I started taking a Spanish -- I don't know why, but the G.I. bill was there and I didn't know what

1946.</sentence><sentence id="654">By that time we -- we got to the point where I n-- I needed.</sentence><sentence id="655">And so I wrote up a catalog in Spanish, we put that up and a -- a letter to all the customers and began working.</sentence><sentence id="656">Pretty soon we were making a little money, not very much.</sentence><sentence id="657">Not enough to live on, but there was still a

dollars.</sentence><sentence id="660">The dollar was no longer available for payment to foreign countries, there was a shortage of d-- of dollars, there was -- there were -- there were exchange

id="663">Well, that stopped, there were no more dollar</sentence><sentence id="665">Interview with Charles Stein 8 June 8, 1999 letters of credit and so we went out of business.</sentence><sentence id="666">And then started an interesting period.</sentence><sentence id="667">I didn't know which way to turn, I -- I'd never even looked for a job, I didn't know how to look for -- well, I-- I knew

that.</sentence><sentence id="679">And they -- they -- they thought that was -- that was good, so my major job was making up the payroll and invoices and making sure that money got to the <span

class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1232">A: Yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1233">In--I--TI mentioned that this was a new project that my friend told me about in the Air Force Intelligence.</sentence><sentence id="1234">What happened was the air force was the, in 1955 was getting into the -- the technological age of information processing.</sentence><sentence id="1235">They were the leaders in the thing.</sentence><sentence id="1236">They had come up with a project that was worked up with IBM and Eastman-Kodak, a combined project of information processing where the information, that is documents, would be photographed on microfilm, and at the same time, there would be an encoding placed on the microfilm and the coding was then read electronically from the film, and would -- and when you -- when you got the right -- right thing, looking for a specific document that contained a subject matter, th-the subject matter was coded.</sentence><sentence id="1237">And that was on there, and that would -- that then would print out the document that pertained to whatever you were looking for.</sentence><sentence id="1238">That was a -- a new way of doing it, you didn't have to have any</sentence><sentence id="1240">40 Interview with Charles Stein June 8, 1999 --any input, typewriter input that you had until that time.</sentence><sentence id="1241">We had to type punch cards and whatever, or type it into the computer and then it would come -- you -- th -- this way you could just photograph it.</sentence><sentence id="1242">Well, it was a novel thing, and that is what they -- they were hiring people to do that.</sentence><sentence id="1243">My job, I became a -- I was hired as the chief of the coding section, and I worked with the tech -- technical part, the -- the contractors on what they were doing and to make sure that we're do -- and we developed -- and again, we did this with the CIA, a -- a code -- a code dictionary, sort of.</sentence><sentence id="1244">An intelligence code, that for everything that was of interest to intelligence, would have a code number.</sentence><sentence id="1245">And then we would have -- this was my section then, readers read the documents that were coming in, intelligence documents, reports from all over the world, and numerically code what was in that document.</sentence><sentence id="1246">That document would then be photographed with the code input also onto the film, and it was available for -- for retrieval.</sentence><sentence id="1247">We had gotten that thing, it took a number of years to -- to do this, we worked from 55 to about -- by deg58 or "59 we had the first installation, and it worked.</sentence><sentence id="1248">We then expanded that to the rest of the air force, and I went out to help the installation of the thing at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Strategic Air Command</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1249">And in <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> at the Air Force Research and Development command and several other <span class="NPIP">places</span>, and we started sending out copies of what we had made the film into those.</sentence><sentence id="1250">And those were little chips, photo chips that ran through just --</sentence><sentence id="1252">similar to -- to punch cards running through when you" re searching, but these were photo chips and when you got a hit it would extract it and make a full copy of it.</sentence><sentence id="1253">Or you could view it on a-- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">microfilm viewer</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1254">That was the main project.</sentence><sentence id="1255">Now, it -- we got into -- more into different arrangements.</sentence><sentence id="1256">That unit then was taken over with a lot of the other air force intelligence into the Defense Intelligence Agency when that was established.</sentence><sentence id="1257">And I was still in charge of that, but I was working on new developments, now we were into computer information, handling a computer.</sentence><sentence id="1258">It was all intelligence handling.</sentence><sentence id="1259">I was not, at that point any more directly involved with the intelligence, but with the technical operation.</sentence><sentence id="1260">And it was that, and DIA just a follow on to the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="1261">And it was that thing that State Department got interested in.</sentence><sentence id="1262">And when I got into State Department, again, they formed a separate unit to start an information processing operation in the State Department, they didn't have any.</sentence><sentence id="1263">As I found out later, they didn't want any.</sentence><sentence id="1264">The <span class="BUILDING">foreign service offices</span>, they didn't want to have

questions.</sentence><sentence id="1278">And a certain congressman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> destroyed my buddy.</sentence><sentence id="1279">The man was so confused he didn't know what to say and the chairman of the committee excused him and said at this point you're not answering any more questions, but your sidekick answers the questions, so let him answer it and you're excused, and he wal -- had to leave the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">committee room</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1280">I sat there for the rest of it and I got through it and I got the money.</sentence><sentence id="1281">So -- however, was an interesting thing.</sentence><sentence id="1282">I was noticing that the chairman's assistants, the -- not a congressman, one of -- his -- his office manager, wi -- whoever he was, had an interesting head movement.</sentence><sentence id="1283">And being a good observer, I had noticed that when they asked first</sentence><sentence id="1285">Interview with Charles Stein 8 June 8, 1999 questions and I was watching that, and I noticed that when he expected a positive answer to something, his head would go this way.</sentence><sentence id="1286">And when the congressman asked a trick question, the guy went this way.</sentence><sentence id="1287">So my eye was on him, and I got through the thing, it worked.</sentence><sentence id="1288">I was right, that that was the way, that he knew -- these people know the answers.</sentence><sentence id="1289">When they ask a question they know the answer.</sentence><sentence id="1290">And so -- they want confirmation of their knowledge, and well anyhow, it -- that -- that was -- it was -- it was a sad thing.</sentence><sentence id="1291">I came out and poor guy <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I asked him to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1292">He wanted to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, I said, you should go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1293">I'll call you later, I'1l tell you what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1294">He said, but di-di -- do you know what -- I said, yeah, we got the money, we're all -- you're all right, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1295">He went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I called him later on and he had calmed down, and he said, he-hell, I--I can't even remember what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1296">And very shortly after that he left the State Department, you know, fortunately there was some higher up sitting in the back listening to this thing and they weren't happy with him, so anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1297">Well, we got the money and we had the department hire contractors, some of these big <span class="BUILDING">information processing firms</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1298">They came in and they started working on a program.</sentence><sentence id="1299">The program was, oh about half way through, and we got more money, because we showed that it was good.</sentence><sentence id="1300">This time we didn't have to testify any more, it was done in the higher-ups.</sentence><sentence id="1301">And they -- let's see, after about -- it was about two and a half</sentence><sentence id="1303">years into the -- into the program, that there was an internal thing.</sentence><sentence id="1304">Again, there's a political thing.</sentence><sentence id="1305">The assistant Secretary of State I worked for and another assistant Secretary of State, who wanted that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span>, the other one, th-the -- the enemy there, the other one was the assistant secretary for administration, who had the computer operation of the State Department, the payroll, in other words.</sentence><sentence id="1306">Payroll and personnel and whatever, but never anything subst -- substance -- substantive in- information, they'd never handle it.</sentence><sentence id="1307">But they saw something that hadn't -- that got money and all kinds of possible -- and they wanted it.</sentence><sentence id="1308">Well, it was a time when my assistant secretary wanted another job.</sentence><sentence id="1309">He wanted to be a -- what do they call that?A diplomat in residence at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1310">We had -- the <span class="BUILDING">university</span>, they have a diplomat in <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>, that a -- that's a cream puff, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1311">And usually that led to an ambassadorship.</sentence><sentence id="1312">People who were s -- who were selected for that.</sentence><sentence id="1313">Well, he was pretty close to that, he wanted an ambassadorship eventually, and he want -- but there was a job that he could have had, but they kept him because he had things going on in his o-operation that were not finished, they wouldn't let him go.</sentence><sentence id="1314">So he changed.</sentence><sentence id="1315">He sold us a-- he sold my -- my organization to administration.</sentence><sentence id="1316">And I said, I'm not available for that.</sentence><sentence id="1317">You can transfer it, but I'm --I'm out.</sentence><sentence id="1318">I--I wouldn't work for those people, I -- well, I knew them, I had worked with them before.</sentence><sentence id="1319">Well, he was friendly enough to say -- he was Jewish, by the way, the only other Jew in</sentence><sentence id="1321">Interview with Charles Stein % June 8, 1999 the <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1322">And he said, I didn't think you would, but I've got another job for you, if you want it.</sentence><sentence id="1323">We have a new inspector general and I've told him about how you go about doing your investigations and how you can do these things and -- and he's interested in you, because you've reviewed, you know what this whole department is doing, you've done a survey to -- to find out what they need, and he wants to talk to you.</sentence><sentence id="1324">And he's -- he's brand new, he just came an -- an ambassador who just came back and got the job as Inspector General.</sentence><sentence id="1325">So I made an appointment, went to see him and he said, yeah, I want you.</sentence><sentence id="1326">And I became a senior foreign service inspector.</sentence><sentence id="1327">Now again, I shifted jobs without try -- even trying, you know, I -- I-- I was asked to.</sentence><sentence id="1328">And when I got into the Inspector General's office, that I hadn't used before, cause they were not in the substantive area, I found that I was in -- in very good company, because most of the senior inspectors were former ambassadors for whom there was no other assignment, there was a limited assignment.</sentence><sentence id="1329">And so they became inspectors and they traveled around from one <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> to the other, to make sure that everything was all right, and they were doing, you know, reviewing the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span>, mainly.</sentence><sentence id="1330">The idea I came up with, that sold m-- sold me to -- to the inspection corps was that there ma -- are many things that are overlapping that are not being looked at in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, th-the various <span class="BUILDING">bureaus</span>, each one working as an independent thing, each one working with all the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> that their -- you know,</sentence><sentence id="1332">Interview with Charles Stein %deg June 8, 1999 the <span class="BUILDING">European bureaus</span>, working with all the <span class="BUILDING">European embassies</span>, but there's no -- no connection between them.</sentence><sentence id="1333">They're doing all kind -- I said, I would like to look into that.</sentence><sentence id="1334">He said that's a great idea, you got it.</sentence><sentence id="1335">So I started out on that and I became -- I was doing -- what'd we call that?</sentence><sentence id="1336">Well, the organizational reviews.</sentence><sentence id="1337">And I did some of those.</sentence><sentence id="1338">As I went on, I did all the -- the <span class="BUILDING">bureaus</span>, and particularly those that covered in substance more than an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1339">The <span class="BUILDING">scientific bureau</span> -- scientific and -- and technical bureau, for example, had these technical attaches out there that weren't talking to each other.</sentence><sentence id="1340">So, there -- it was a question of -- of getting information to them and -- I mean, getting information between them and not just reporting back to the <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> and the thing gets lost in the <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1341">And the <span class="BUILDING">consular offices</span>, for -- of course, there are <span class="BUILDING">consulates</span> in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and more than there are <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span>, and they're not talking to each other.</sentence><sentence id="1342">They're reporting in, it's all a one way flow, nothing goes out -- oh, excuse me -- to -- to all the others.</sentence><sentence id="1343">And so I started working on that and I usually got a couple of other officers assigned to me, some of the junior officers that were also working with the inspectors and we sat down and we ju -- started interviewing and looking into the records and all that, we find out how things were and sort of rewrote the -- the -- the job descriptions.</sentence><sentence id="1344">The -- the job [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="1345">I had one particular one that was of great interest to me, having been a refugee once, and that was, I came across, while I was looking at</sentence><sentence id="1347">these various organizations in the department of a special assistant to the Secretary of State for Refugee Affairs.</sentence><sentence id="1348">When I looked into that I found that the man was a political appointee.</sentence><sentence id="1349">He'd made big contributions to somebody and he had a few people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, but his work was being done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> at the U.S. mission to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1350">In the process I also found that there was a special assistant to the Secretary of State for international Red Cross affairs.</sentence><sentence id="1351">Now here we have the international Red Cross, a British a -- a Swiss organization, and they have a <span class="BUILDING">one man office</span> with one secretary who's a special assistant and who handles contacts with that.</sentence><sentence id="1352">But the international Red Cross is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and who handles the -- the br -- the work?</sentence><sentence id="1353">The <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1354">And this is a large <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the united na -- in the mission to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1355">The U.S. mission.</sentence><sentence id="1356">And I found a third one, a-a- another special assistant for a humanitar -- for -- not for humanitarian, for disaster relief affairs.</sentence><sentence id="1357">Again, all of them political appointees.</sentence><sentence id="1358">Well, I went -- so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and talked to the people there and looked and see what they were doing and they were hardworking people.</sentence><sentence id="1359">They were doing the budgeting for -- for these various operations.</sentence><sentence id="1360">They were representing the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> before the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and before all the various organizations that physically handled refugees and disasters and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1361">And I came back and I wrote a -- oh, about a 200 page report.</sentence><sentence id="1362">This was about a six months affair.</sentence><sentence id="1363">I wrote a rit -- I wrote a report and I said, reorganize</sentence><sentence id="1365">Interview with Charles Stein %8 June 8, 1999 the whole thing and my s -- my recommendation was that -- to get another position as an assistant Secretary of Affairs for Humanitarian affairs, all this comes under that subject heading and abolish these special assistants.</sentence><sentence id="1366">Have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> do the work and have <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> have a -- a regular <span class="BUILDING">office</span> doing whatever is necessary in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, such as you know, budget -- getting -- getting money and so forth.</sentence><sentence id="1367">And that was finished in 1990 -- in January of 19 four -- four -- 1974, I finished that particular report.</sentence><sentence id="1368">And then I went on and was doing -- I think the next one was consular affairs and I was just about finished with consular affairs when one day I get a phone call from the <span class="BUILDING">refugee office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1369">The deputy to this political appointee was a regular foreign service officer whom I knew, I had contact with.</sentence><sentence id="1370">And he calls me and he said, I have a problem.</sentence><sentence id="1371">We've seen your report and I think it's great.</sentence><sentence id="1372">They thought they were getting to be the assistant secretary job.</sentence><sentence id="1373">They were -- they were the biggest one, of course.</sentence><sentence id="1374">Anyhow, we tha -- we thought we -- we have a -- we have a problem, our man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, our -- the head of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> just informed us that he is retiring in August.</sentence><sentence id="1375">This is about the fifth -- I think it was the day after the Fourth of July weekend, I'd just come back.</sentence><sentence id="1376">And he said, you're the only one who knows what's going on out there.</sentence><sentence id="1377">How would you like to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>?</sentence><sentence id="1378">And my answer to that, and I remember that to this day and will always remember it, was don't bother me with details, send five tickets.</sentence><sentence id="1379">We had a meeting after that, he explained</sentence><sentence id="1381">Interview with Charles Stein deg June 8, 1999 to me what this problem was and I said yes, ?"</sentence><sentence id="1382">ll--T'll--T'll accept and I'll go.</sentence><sentence id="1383">And six weeks later we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> and I was running that <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1384">And I'd gotten, of course, I was at the time -- this -- the main job of that particular <span class="BUILDING">office</span> really, was handling the Russian refugees that were coming out by about 20 or 30,000 a year.</sentence><sentence id="1385">That was the beginning of the -- the major exodus from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1386">What they were doing, and I was doing for the next four years was dealing with the voluntary agencies, HIAS, Tolstoy Foundation, the International Catholic Migration Commission, the World Council of Churches and many others.</sentence><sentence id="1387">The -- the Polish American refugee, or Czech American.</sentence><sentence id="1388">All of those, all over Europe.</sentence><sentence id="1389">They -- tho -- they were physically receiving these refugees, most of them, of course, Jews.</sentence><sentence id="1390">All of them, probably.</sentence><sentence id="1391">And were trying to resettle them in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span>, in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span>, wherever.</sentence><sentence id="1392">And my job was to make sure that the U.S. money that went to these <span class="BUILDING">agencies</span> for handling that, was properly used, that they were doing their job, and make sure that they were doing what they were supposed to do in the resettlement process.</sentence><sentence id="1393">And I learned a lot about Russians during that period, and others, but mainly the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1394">Went to one of my jobs and the family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span>, the kids were in <span class="BUILDING">international schools</span>, which was a good experience for them, and my job was making -- reviewing the budgets, reviewing their budget requests and changing them where it was necessary.</sentence><sentence id="1395">They were all inflated, of</sentence><sentence id="1397">Interview with Charles Stein *deg June 8, 1999 course, the usual thing.</sentence><sentence id="1398">I was the first -- first stop.</sentence><sentence id="1399">And -- and actually, physically looking at them, periodically.</sentence><sentence id="1400">So every month I would be in one or -- or two, I'd be in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span>, and I'd be in -- in-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.133" long="11.567">Munich</span>, where many of them were.</sentence><sentence id="1401">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span>, which were the main parts and occasionally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span>, behind the Iron Curtain then, talking to our people.</sentence><sentence id="1402">And <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> is -- it was another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1403"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1404">Several <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> where they -- these people were, and working with them to expedite the process.</sentence><sentence id="1405">I had one critical, really critical thing.</sentence><sentence id="1406">That was, the Kurds in <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> would not let them out and it was a long process and finally they wouldn't let any -- finally they decide that yes, they could leave and so we would -- wanted to send in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and they wouldn't allow us.</sentence><sentence id="1407">And the international Red Cross, I involved them in it, and the international Red Cross was going to send in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and they wouldn't let them.</sentence><sentence id="1408">And finally there was a--a charter from -- Lufthansa had a charter service and the international Red Cross managed to get one of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, and they gave in.</sentence><sentence id="1409">Now, these people were to be brought out, the -- they -- ere -- ira -- ara -- Iranians gave in and let them go.</sentence><sentence id="1410">The people -- the -- the law, there was a special law that Congress enacted to let these people into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but it expired on a certain date, which was about -- we were one day away from that date when the thing -- when the Iranians gave in and the Red Cross took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> over, got the people up and got them to</sentence><sentence id="1412">Interview with Charles Stein * June 8, 1999 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1413">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to work with our <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> to make sure that these people get their visas.</sentence><sentence id="1414">It was just -- they had to get their passports stamped.</sentence><sentence id="1415">That was it.</sentence><sentence id="1416">What ha -- when they got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was unimportant, but before that date -- oh, this was the day.</sentence><sentence id="1417">I get to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and they're processing it, doing a good job, and they still got about a -- about a hundred people at five o'clock in the afternoon, the consul -- the U.S. consul says well, we're gonna have to continue that tomorrow, we're going <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1418">I said no, you're not.</sentence><sentence id="1419">He said well, yeah, but you know, the day is over.</sentence><sentence id="1420">I said, the law expires at midnight and as far as I'm concerned it's midnight in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1421">And it is five o'clock and it's noon, we got 12 hours to go, you've got to finish these people.</sentence><sentence id="1422">He says no, I can't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1423">I said, I want a <span class="DLF">line</span> to the assistant secretary for consular affairs, whom I knew well.</sentence><sentence id="1424">I had done a job for her before I left and we had good -- good relationship.</sentence><sentence id="1425">And he got -- he says okay, so he got the <span class="DLF">line</span> through.</sentence><sentence id="1426">He couldn't refuse me, so he got the <span class="DLF">line</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1427">And I talked to the lady and I said, I've got a reluctant [indecipherable] I'm -- we're doing the Kurds, and she said yeah, yeah, how you doing?</sentence><sentence id="1428">I said we -- there's still about a hundred left that have not, and -- been visa'd and your man here wants to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, he wants to close up.</sentence><sentence id="1429">She said, let me have him.</sentence><sentence id="1430">I said -- handed him the

Well, by about 10 o'clock that night we were finished.</sentence><sentence id="1434">Everybody had their visa, stamped with today's date -- with that day's date and the next day we got them on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and sent them to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> But those are the kind of things that you -- the troubleshooting type things that -- that you had to do every once in awhile.</sentence><sentence id="1435">Had to intervene in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> with the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="1436">The Russians in -- in-- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> were treated very nice, they had them out on the -- on the li -- li -- just like they have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span>, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brighton Beach</span>, they all live out there.</sentence><sentence id="1437">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> they had them out on the -- on -- near the <span

id="1442">The government gave them.</sentence><sentence id="1443">They were still in that mode.</sentence><sentence id="1444">And we had some serious problems there, the people were intimidated by them.</sentence><sentence id="1445">And I told them, don't be intimidated, you've got -- they had Russian speakers there, and they were -- I--I--I told them how -- how to talk to these people.</sentence><sentence id="1446">Just yell at them.</sentence><sentence id="1447">Tell them to go away, they get nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1448">One more word out of you and you're out,

good people.</sentence><sentence id="1457">And in that particular case, and there were a lot of them there, the word got to all of them, I was the United States government.</sentence><sentence

that -- that -- that did it.</sentence><sentence id="1461">When the government says you gotta be quiet, you're quiet.</sentence><sentence id="1462">So we're -- you know, it was game playing, but -- it was -- it was acting.</sentence><sentence id="1463">I did not go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hollywood</span> after that.</sentence><sentence id="1464">That's -- you know, experiences like that, that was -- that was my job.</sentence><sentence id="1465">And of course I saw a lot of misery too, people coming out and having to sit in those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in some <span class="REGION">areas</span>, they were not too pleasant.</sentence><sentence id="1466">Some intellectuals, people with -- who had status and -- and now were begging, in
