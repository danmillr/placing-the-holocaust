<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="80">Q: Was there any conscious -- political consciousness about 2</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="82">"As No, my parents were both -- I guess they both felt -- especially my dad, that they belong to the Russian Italian Embessy.</sentence><sentence id="83">I guess that my mother didn't.</sentence><sentence id="84">My mother was really very high politicalized person, but she was much broader, my father was not.</sentence><sentence id="85">And my father belonged to that category of Jews who had aligned themselves with the Russian Communist Party to a great extent.</sentence><sentence id="86">And really thought of themselves as Russians not as Jews.</sentence><sentence id="87">And felt that they had been totally accepted in the world of Russians on .</sentence><sentence id="88">That is what he felt.</sentence><sentence id="89">And so one of my uncles had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span> and came back and was disappointed in it.</sentence><sentence id="90">I never met him really from the time I was a child until the time I was an adult, I was never really able to talk to him about his feelings or his experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">Pakistan</span>.</sentence><sentence id="91">Now my other uncle had run a communist army and went out and fought in the army and stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="102">Q: The reason I am asking this is I am trying to get a sense of how the weren't practicing at all.</sentence><sentence id="103">What really -- how you identified with being Jewish?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="106">A: I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="107">I didn't until I was in my teens.</sentence><sentence id="108">Until way way after the war.</sentence><sentence id="109">As far as I could see there were the Germans and they were the enemy.</sentence><sentence id="110">And then there were all the French speaking people.</sentence><sentence id="111">And they were the good guys that included the French and the Belgiums.</sentence><sentence id="112">And then of course, the Flemish (ph) Belgiums.</sentence><sentence id="113">And, I wasn't really too conscious of the Dutch.</sentence><sentence id="114">But I was conscious of the British as being the good guy which was a little bit confusing later on.</sentence><sentence id="115">Because, I knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wellington</span> was the bad guy.</sentence><sentence id="116">My historical concepts got very very mixed up.</sentence><sentence id="117">But at that time the British were good and the French were super good and the Germans were super bad.</sentence><sentence id="118">And so I really put down all the horrors of war to the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys.</sentence><sentence id="119">And I wasn't really conscious of the bad things that they were doing to the Jews because they were equally bad things to people that I knew and saw around me.</sentence><sentence id="120">Now by the time we got to the South of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and I got myself situated or I didn't, my history did.</sentence><sentence id="121">I got me situated in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where there were many many Jews living as well, even though I still considered myself French.</sentence><sentence id="122">I began to get a sense of the bad things that were being done to the Jews and -- but I still wasn't clear that I was a Jew at all.</sentence><sentence id="123">I just thought that these were poor people who were being treated shamelessly, and so it was kind of difficult.</sentence><sentence id="124">But later on -- oh, maybe about seven or eight or ten years ago, but no more than that, I met somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">Quite by accident, who had been the daughter of one of the villagers in one of the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that we lived in.</sentence><sentence id="126">And she and her husband had been running a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and distributing leaphlets to their <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tickets booth</span> on <span class="DLF">42nd Street</span>.</sentence><sentence id="127">And, I was teading a French book and that got us into a conversation which finally ended up by telling her where I was from and she said "Oh my goodness, she was from there.</sentence><sentence id="128">When did I live there?"</sentence><sentence id="129">Very suspiciously she asked me this and I told her and she looked at me and she said "Oh, were you the Belgiums or the Jews?"</sentence><sentence id="130">So which really brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me the fact that I wasn't the only one that considered myself not a part of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span>.</sentence><sentence id="131">Because there were many -- I don't know, there were quite a few maybe 20, 30, Jewish people who were living there, you know, under village arrest.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="158">Q: You wete aware that you were Jews but you weren't aware of the double risk?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="160">A: Absolutely not.</sentence><sentence id="161">I didn't realize that anybody was at a double risk.</sentence><sentence id="162">And I was a small child and quite innocent.</sentence><sentence id="163">My knowledge of war came from literature.</sentence><sentence id="164">And in literature there is no such thing as this.</sentence><sentence id="165">At least not the literature that you read when you ate six or seven years old.</sentence><sentence id="166">There ate good guys and there are bad guys, and that is basically it.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="174">Q: Let's go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="175">I want you to tell me a little about what you were, your family knew about Hitler or Naziism (ph) before <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="178">A: I knew nothing.</sentence><sentence id="179">My father, I really don't know.</sentence><sentence id="180">My father obviously knew everything that my mother did because she would have shared it with him.</sentence><sentence id="181">My mother was a clinical scientist and she said that when I was born, she cried and cried and cried and cried because it was 1933 and she could see what was coming.</sentence><sentence id="182">So she was very aware.</sentence><sentence id="183">And I know that when I was a child there had been many many conversations about immigrating.</sentence><sentence id="184">And my father kept saying no, we will be okay and my mother kept saying, no we got to go.</sentence><sentence id="185">At one point they -- my mother and I, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> (ph) where my maternal grandparents were living and we went to where my maternal grandmother was living.</sentence><sentence id="186">You see my maternal grandparents and my maternal grandmother were living and to try to get them out.</sentence><sentence id="187">At one point my maternal grandparents did leave <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> (ph) and they went to visit their son who at this time, that's the man who had gone to live on _____ at one point.</sentence><sentence id="188">And he was now living in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> with his wife and two children.</sentence><sentence id="189">I guess maybe that he didn't even have two children at that time.</sentence><sentence id="190">Yeah, but anyway they went to visit him and they decided they really wanted to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span>, they didn't feel comfortable.</sentence><sentence id="191">They felt that maybe they were too old to take on this culture.</sentence><sentence id="192">My mother and father argued with them that a Spanish culture was something very foreign to them.</sentence><sentence id="193">French or <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> culture would be something they would be much more familiar with, at least through their education, etcetera etcetera and tried to convince them to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="194">They declined this as well and went on back.</sentence><sentence id="195">And then in 1937 my mother and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> (ph) and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span>, and tried to get my grandparents to leave, to no avail.</sentence><sentence id="196">So that is how much my patents knew, a great deal, a great great deal.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="216">Q: What do you remember about this when it happened, how things started changing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="218">Pats Well, we didn't stay.</sentence><sentence id="219">But how it happened was very sudden, it happened overnight.</sentence><sentence id="220">It happened in one or two days.</sentence><sentence id="221">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> one day and the school teacher told us that they were passing out flowers in a corner and we should take these flowers and take the petals off of them and put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baskets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="222">Because, the next day our armys would come on through on their way to fight the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="223">And so we did this to the flowers and a great deal of hooplah and horay horay, we ate going to be saved.</sentence><sentence id="224">The next day we were excused from <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="225">And, my <span class="BUILDING">parents house</span> was on a main toad which was a two-lane <span class="DLF">highway</span> but was still a main <span class="DLF">road</span>.</sentence><sentence id="226">And, the troops came marching down the main <span class="DLF">road</span> where everybody who lived anywhere near was out on the <span class="DLF">streets</span>.</sentence><sentence id="227">And people had bread and they had cheese and they had wine and lots and lots and lots of wine which they gave to the soldiers wishing them well and wishing them luck and children would throw petals on the soldiers marching by.</sentence><sentence id="228">It was very glorious and very very glorious and three days later they came back or four days later or something, you know.</sentence><sentence id="229">The wat was won, the Germans had walked all over them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="242">Q: How was the mood?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="244">A: Well, they went from total elation to total defeat, I mean not good.</sentence><sentence id="245">There is a very very powerful poem written by -- I believe it is .</sentence><sentence id="246">It just basically sets the tone for this you know, it says: The month of May was the month of roses and the month of lilies, and the month of June had a dagger in its heart.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="250">Q: Were the people in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> trying to deal with this in any certain way?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="252">A: I don't think -- I may be wrong.</sentence><sentence id="253">But I really don't think, apart from the political groups, that people in <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and maybe more <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> than that to, were really so aware of the Nazis as being different from the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="254">Don't forget that the French and the Germans had these conflicts for centuries.</sentence><sentence id="255">And the most recent one was in 1914 and it was a question of land grabbing and wanting more power and this had already been done through the Eastern Army that was what <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was all about.</sentence><sentence id="256">And that's what parts of were all about and so I think, although I have no reason to say that, other than what I have read since.</sentence><sentence id="257">But people were probably more conscious with the fact that this was another devastating war that was going to take place.</sentence><sentence id="258">But, I don't think that anybody thought of it as strictly political war or even any political overtones.</sentence><sentence id="259">I think that came quite a bit later.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="269">Q: Now, while you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, did you come in contact with German troops?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="271">Pats No, not at all.</sentence><sentence id="272">While I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and when my father went to work one day, oh -- within a week or so of the occupation and his boss said to him that he felt that my dad should take his family and leave.</sentence><sentence id="273">That he wasn't a <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> number one, and that he was a Jew, number two, and that he was at great, great risk.</sentence><sentence id="274">So he gave my father what amounted to six month salary and he said "God Bless You," and when he gave my dad a letter of introduction to his <span class="BUILDING">sister factory</span> in __ and we left.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="279">Q: Let me just ask you one question while we are on that.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Sure.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="281">Q: So even the short time and we are talking a few weeks --</sentence></p></dialogue>
