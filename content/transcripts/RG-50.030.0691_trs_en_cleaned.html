<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="482">A: I didn't have too much, I guess the excitement, and all that stuff, that you don't think about it, I was just trying to get out of that fiery <span

off.</sentence><sentence id="489">So I stuck my parachute under some bushes there at the edge of the <span class="DLF">field</span>, and ran through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and got to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I didn't know going to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is that I was getting deeper in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span>, but I

rattles like a tin can, you know, so I heard rattling, so I just dove under some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> right there and pulled them down kind of over me and laid there, waited, and hear when the Germans come up, he's -- I could reach out and grab his pant leg, he was so close, but he was looking way out ahead, he wasn't looking down at his feet.</sentence><sentence id="494">And I don't know, it seemed like I laid there for a day, it was probably an hour or something like that, and he kept looking out there, and I didn't breathe for a couple hours, I don't think.</sentence><sentence id="495">But anyhow, they finally went away and then I just walked through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and -- and I got my maps and there -- they had maps

where I was at, and I located myself and then I started out to cross this one <span class="DLF">road</span>, a <span class="DLF">divided highway</span>.</sentence><sentence id="497">And then I heard a

growing in the middle of it.</sentence><sentence id="498">And around the corner I get -- hear them coming.</sentence><sentence id="499">So I dove into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and hear a bunch of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> and everything else was coming by, and guys in, I don't know, looked like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored cars</span> or something, I didn't -- I wasn't able to really look, I was -- buried myself in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span>, hoping they</sentence><sentence id="501">Interview with Chasten Bowen " April 26, 2013

across an old deserted -- I don't know was a pigpen or whatever it was, but it was pretty dilapidated.</sentence><sentence id="507">So I went in there cause it had been raining, and I got all wet and

know if it was a fake, or what, but they said he knocked a bowl of soup out of one of the guy's hands.</sentence><sentence id="1068">So a bunch of them jumped on him and put a blanket over his head and slugged him to death.</sentence><sentence id="1069">It was just, you know, dog eat dog type attitude.</sentence><sentence id="1070">And then they had these guys, you maybe heard of <span

40.</sentence><sentence id="1079">And one day they took -- took -- I heard -- I don't know how many, but th -- 17 of them went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span>, and I guess were tried,

out two of them were from <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span>, they were twins, and one had had a scar up in his shoulder, and they put a scar on the other one's shoulder just like it.</sentence><sentence id="1082">And they had -- one would be up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span>, up in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span>, another would be down in <span

evidence, because you know, he'd be -- be real obvious around someplace, and he said no, I was, you know, here.</sentence><sentence id="1083">I wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="1084">And here that they -- they finally coupled the fact together that this -- they were twins, and the Germans finally caught them both.</sentence><sentence id="1085">And later on they were both killed.</sentence><sentence id="1086">They killed all those SOE guys, the British guys.</sentence><sentence id="1087">And the Russian guys</sentence><sentence id="1089">Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 --ILused to talk to some of the Russians, they'd speak a little bit of English, and one of them used to tell me all the time that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> would never survive because we produced so many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and stuff like that, and we would financially and everything, fold after the war, that we couldn't stand all that production, and stuff like that.</sentence><sentence id="1090">A few little conversations like that we had with the Russians, you know, that did speak some English.</sentence><sentence id="1091">And they -- I don't know if you've ever seen the [indecipherable] but I didn't know til after the war that they had a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> up there, the Russians, a lot of them disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="1092">They would take them up there and there was a like a--a medical examination.</sentence><sentence id="1093">They'd stand them on some scales, and they had a <span class="DLF">hole</span> right behind the scales, there in the <span class="DLF">wall</span>, and a gun back there, and they'd turn around like that, and shoot them right through the back of the head.</sentence><sentence id="1094">And they eliminated a whole bunch of Russians that way by -- by make -- make them think they were giving them a medical, they were standing on the scale, then bam, they're gone.</sentence><sentence id="1095">And the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> there was -- I've been there a few times after the war, after I been out of there, and they still have the hooks on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> where they used to hang the prisoners, and they would cut them, their legs and bodies, and bleed -- let the blood drain out of them into the <span class="DLF">drain</span>, because then they would burn them in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> upstairs, and they had these little trollies that they'd lay them on and wheel them up there, and then wheel them into these <span class="INT_SPACE">chambers</span> up</sentence><sentence id="1097">Interview with Chasten Bowen April 26, 2013 there, had about, I don't know, eight or 10 of these <span class="INT_SPACE">cremation chambers</span> up there, wheel them in there and cremate them.</sentence><sentence id="1098">Cause they had bodies stacked by the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> all day long.</sentence><sentence id="1099">The -- used to see so much inhumanity to man, that you couldn't understand.</sentence><sentence id="1100">You're already a prisoner, and you'd be sta-- we'd stand up there -- we counted -- they called it appel.</sentence><sentence id="1101">My number was 78,336, but -- and we weren't tattooed, and we used to ask the kapos, the fa -- the kapos told us that we were not tattooed because we were trading material.</sentence><sentence id="1102">I guess -- we -- we assumed that that was going to be trading for German prisoners, you know, that we're -- we captured or something.</sentence><sentence id="1103">We didn't -- and know -- don't really know to this day what it was all about, why we weren't tattooed.</sentence><sentence id="1104">But there were about -- later on I found there were about, probably about 50,000 prisoners there, you know [indecipherable] 78,000, but they were dying off so fast, and I later fi -- learned after the war that -- from the archives at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span> that the diet was designed to starve you to death in about three months.</sentence><sentence id="1105">Keep cycling prisoners through there, cause they needed ru -- labor, slave labor to work in the pri -- in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and stuff, you know?</sentence><sentence id="1106">So that was one way of just getting rid of them, starve them to death, rather than shoot them, or some go to -- took energy and took people.</sentence><sentence id="1107">I've heard all sorts of rumors, I don't know why, but I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1108">I've heard that the -- they used to lie in the -- you've seen where the pictures of the Jewish people lined</sentence><sentence id="1110">Interview with Chasten Bowen 8 April 26, 2013 up by ga -- by these <span class="DLF">pits</span> and they'd shoot them and drop in the <span class="DLF">pits</span> and they'd cover them up.</sentence><sentence id="1111">But the people that had to mow them down, those people had mental problems because they didn't -- you know, they were killing other humans.</sentence><sentence id="1112">So that's why the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> came into being, so much.</sentence><sentence id="1113">That was to -- cause it wasn't such a personal thing.</sentence><sentence id="1114">So -- but it's [indecipherable] because when we stand up for appel to be counted, these SS guys would stand up there, they count your heads, and they had to have the count right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before they would excuse you, go back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span>, or where you're gonna go.</sentence><sentence id="1115">Sometimes it'd take three hours, and it -- guys -- some of the guys were -- I weighed 82 pounds when I got out of there, s- some of the guys were skinnier than I was, couldn't stand up.</sentence><sentence id="1116">And you'd try to help them stand up, and the SS guys would wade in there and knock his brains out with a rifle butt, and make the prisoners put him on a gunny sack, four of them carry him over and stack him by the bodies by the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="1117">So it's just -- and there was these two wheel <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> running around all day, picking up bodies and hauling them to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1118">So it was just not a very good environment.</sentence><sentence id="1119">And you just wonder -- I used to wonder about how can people be so cruel, and just -- you're already prisoners, you know, why make it even worse?</sentence><sentence id="1120">But we had a guy whose name the ger -- the German SS guy up there was named Hauptman.</sentence><sentence id="1121">And he would stand up there when we were out there, and ge -- weather got kind of cool, and he</sentence><sentence id="1123">Interview with Chasten Bowen " April 26, 2013 had a little bucket, and he had a little cup in it, and he'd say -- he'd pull back his uniform, show he had woolen underwear underneath.</sentence><sentence id="1124">And he'd say, cold, cold?</sentence><sentence id="1125">And then he'd throw -- take a s-scoop up a bucket of this water -- a scoop of this water and throw it out over us, you know, like spray us, you know, with a little bit of water.</sentence><sentence id="1126">He'd say cold?</sentence><sentence id="1127">He just kind of tormented, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1128">I don't know what he did it for, but it -- how -- I don't know how people get some enjoyment out of that.</sentence><sentence id="1129">Anyway, that was my feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1130">And one day the Americans came over and bombed the -- when we were <span class="NPIP">outside</span>, I was telling you before, living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the rocks were -- after that bombing, why, we were asked, will you come down and guide us?They said, if you were soldiers, you have the discipline to help us with the wounded.</sentence><sentence id="1131">And they had a guy in there, I don't know h -- the -- he spoke a British accent, like he was -- be-been trained in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> or something, and he would talk to us, you know, he was the guy that they used for communication to us.</sentence><sentence id="1132">And then the -- they had another guy in there named -- he was a Dutchman from du -- <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span>, he spoke good English and he spoke German also.</sentence><sentence id="1133">So they'd communicate through him, and he gave us lots of information.</sentence><sentence id="1134">But anyway, they come down and got us, they says, you will help us with the wounded people in the bombing.</sentence><sentence id="1135">Took us up there, and I didn't help anybody, cause I had no shoes, I was running through this fire and nails and stuff out there, and wood and stuff, and I was</sentence><sentence id="1137">Interview with Chasten Bowen * April 26, 2013 going as slow as I could.</sentence><sentence id="1138">And I saw a wooden -- wooden shoe laying over there, and so I kneeled down and put that wooden shoe on my left foot, and the German guards over there picked up some board and started beating me across the back, and you know, knocked the wind out of me.</sentence><sentence id="1139">It seemed like I climbed -- I crawled about a mile, probably about 20 feet, but it seemed like a mile, and just got -- almost knocked me out, cause I couldn't hardly breathe, you know, knocked the wind out of me.</sentence><sentence id="1140">And I didn't help anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1141">I just act like I was help -- trying to help some, put out the fire, something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1142">I just went around, but I didn't do a darn thing, but no one bothered me after that.</sentence><sentence id="1143">Finally, I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> I was in, but I sure didn't help anybody.</sentence><sentence id="1144">Some of the guys, I guess, had to help somebody, you know, I didn't.</sentence><sentence id="1145">But anyway, when the Luftwaffe guy came through to look -- he's -- I guess he was going to say, look at the bomb damage, he told the -- the other SS guys that.</sentence><sentence id="1146">And he came in.</sentence><sentence id="1147">Well, we had a guy, Ben Sharf(ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Prague</span>, <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span>, he was our waist gunner.</sentence><sentence id="1148">He spoke German from his ancestor was German.</sentence><sentence id="1149">And so we said, Ben, you gotta go

26, 2013 they talked a few minutes, and then the SS tried to break it up, and he pulled his rank on them and told them to stand back, and so he talked about five minutes to Ben, and he told Ben that they didn't work very good with the Gestapo and the SS, but he'd do what he could, but we should be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span>, he agreed.</sentence><sentence id="1156">And we thought, well, that's encouraging news, but -- and he left.</sentence><sentence id="1157">And it was, I don't know, a month later, when I hear about a contingent of about 150 Luftwaffe people came

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1544">A: Well, you don't want the Russians to get ahold of us, they wanted to just keep us as prisoners, cause we were material that they could trade, or hold
