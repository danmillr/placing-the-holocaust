always in silence.</sentence><sentence id="1552">They moved us around and we moved around because we wanted to be with certain girls and we didn't want to be divided and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1553">So there was always a big doing on and they didn't do anything to us.</sentence><sentence id="1554">Anyway they divided us.</sentence><sentence id="1555">Part of us went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and part of us went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shtutthof</span> [ph].</sentence><sentence id="1556">And they added some Hungarian girls but I don't know if ever anybody told you that.</sentence><sentence id="1557">Before we left we were examined internally.</sentence><sentence id="1558">Because perhaps we were hiding some gold or something.</sentence><sentence id="1559">So and then we got brought to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and when we were brought to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we saw that there were not only SS men but soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1560">But first of all it was a relief that we left, we were going out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because nobody in their right mind ever could fathom that that would happen.</sentence><sentence id="1561">So they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we were, again there was nowhere to sit you know.</sentence><sentence id="1562">Just the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1563">But we stopped quite often because there were air raids because we drove, we didn't know where we were going.</sentence><sentence id="1564">We drove through the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> we went all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1565">So when we arrived at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> the next day and I do think it was my birthday.</sentence><sentence id="1566">And it wasn't the 16" or 17".</sentence><sentence id="1567">I believe it was my birthday.</sentence><sentence id="1568">And so we found out that we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1569">And they put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1570">I found out just a few years ago that it used to be a <span class="BUILDING">tobacco warehouse</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1571">Right now I have a picture of it because I told you, I got in touch with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and they sent me pictures.</sentence><sentence id="1572">I have pictures of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> we were.</sentence><sentence id="1573">And there they write that we arrived between the 16" and 17" but I'm quite sure we came there a little earlier.</sentence><sentence id="1574">And it was clean.</sentence><sentence id="1575">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were only two stories.</sentence><sentence id="1576">Like one on upper and one lower Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 34 November 29, 2012 so that wasn't -- before we had three stories.</sentence><sentence id="1577">And they were smaller ones.</sentence><sentence id="1578">Only about two together and we each had our own little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span>, kind of.</sentence><sentence id="1579">And the soup was better.</sentence><sentence id="1580">And there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1581">I mean we were in <span class="NPIP">heaven</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1582">And but the first night the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> started to shake and we didn't know what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1583">It was an air raid.</sentence><sentence id="1584">And some girls yelled to the others who were up there.</sentence><sentence id="1585">Don't move.</sentence><sentence id="1586">What are you moving.</sentence><sentence id="1587">The whole thing shakes.</sentence><sentence id="1588">We had no idea that the bombs are falling all around us.</sentence><sentence id="1589">And so we started going to work.</sentence><sentence id="1590">At first they put us on a shift and I mean we went to different <span class="NPIP">places</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1591">Mostly oil companies, we were cleaning up.</sentence><sentence id="1592">You know that's what we were doing first, to clean up.</sentence><sentence id="1593">But I remember they brought me to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my first job was to wash <span class="DLF">windows</span> and I have said to the fellow, could I have some newspaper and he said what do you need newspaper for?</sentence><sentence id="1594">I said well to wash the <span class="DLF">windows</span> you will see.</sentence><sentence id="1595">And when I was finished they couldn't believe it, what a good job I did.</sentence><sentence id="1596">And we got a little better soup.</sentence><sentence id="1597">And there were other people working there but we found out later on were Dutch people and French people, not they weren't -- they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1598">And they were also working in these <span class="BUILDING">factories</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1599">To clean up after the air raids, but you know just to clean up.</sentence><sentence id="1600">And the air raids were continuous.</sentence><sentence id="1601">During the night and during the day like we would go in the morning and there were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> standing nicely and on the way back there was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1602">You could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> was hanging on and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> was on the other hand hanging there.</sentence><sentence id="1603">I mean they did a real good job I can tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1604">And but the British knew and the Americans knew where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1605">That there were a group of women.</sentence><sentence id="1606">They're not going to bomb us.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1665">Q: The <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1667">A: Where we stayed and even where we worked.</sentence><sentence id="1668">And so we were there a few weeks.</sentence><sentence id="1669">And I just found from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, I got this literature and it says let me tell you.</sentence><sentence id="1670">We went to <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niue Graden</span> and we arrived there on the 13" of September and we left there on the 8" of February.</sentence><sentence id="1671">So we were there the whole winter.</sentence><sentence id="1672">We went to <span class="BUILDING">work</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1673">People worked all over, but my group went to work in a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> because they built little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because don't forget the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, they had nowhere to live.</sentence><sentence id="1674">And so we were building little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and so I was ina group where we're working in a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1675">And so we each got a shovel and started shoveling the sand and we had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that you know little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they put sand there.</sentence><sentence id="1676">And we had a Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 35 November 29, 2012 foreman who was an old German, skinny guy who was very decent.</sentence><sentence id="1677">And he saw that I seemed to be a good worker.</sentence><sentence id="1678">And it's funny when they see that you are a good worker, they always kind of find you a good job.</sentence><sentence id="1679">So he stopped me and he said you are going to be the switcher.</sentence><sentence id="1680">So I became the switcher on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and you know there was a fellow who was the driver of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I was the switcher.</sentence><sentence id="1681">And the driver, he was a communist and he had to go to the police, I believe every night or once a week so that he didn't run away or something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1682">But the air raids were unbelievable and so when the air raids were, the thing was we had to watch out where the - - it was called flak.</sentence><sentence id="1683">That <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">anti-aircraft</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1684">You know it splinters, it splinters and if that caught you, you were dead.</sentence><sentence id="1685">So when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>, when these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were empty we would turn them upside down.</sentence><sentence id="1686">We could do that and we would hide under, yes and you could hear ping, ping, ping, you know how these things are falling on it.</sentence><sentence id="1687">So we were there for a while until I told you til the second, til the eighth of February.</sentence><sentence id="1688">And then they moved us again.</sentence><sentence id="1689">Oh by the way, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niue Graden</span> it's today a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1690">And I had a friend.</sentence><sentence id="1691">Her name was Ruth Pinchovsky and she, that name afterwards oh she married a fellow, Fayon and you know she was fighting with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> that they shouldn't allow to put a <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="1692">But anyway, I have a picture of the <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span>, a part of the <span class="BUILDING">shopping center</span> and there is a tablet where it says that we were there.</sentence><sentence id="1693">That's what I read from.</sentence><sentence id="1694">And anyway so they moved us to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiesstack</span> on the eighth of February right.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1724">Q: How do you spell that?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1726">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiesstack</span>, T-I-E-S-S-T-A-C-K. And I was chosen to work right outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1727">I was making big bricks with <span class="DLF">holes</span> you know.</sentence><sentence id="1728">Like I had a helper.</sentence><sentence id="1729">She was mixing the cement with a stone and then I would put it in the form and bang it down and make it so solid and then you put out this form.</sentence><sentence id="1730">You lift it out and you had this brick.</sentence><sentence id="1731">But you had to work hard otherwise it would fall apart.</sentence><sentence id="1732">And then somebody came and they put it in the, it would be dried and they would make new <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1733">And it's a strange thing.</sentence><sentence id="1734">I remember most everything but I could not tell you who was living with me in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where I was.</sentence><sentence id="1735">What it was like.</sentence><sentence id="1736">They sent me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> a picture of that <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1737">It doesn't say anything to me.</sentence><sentence id="1738">I remember that there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining hall</span> which was a long <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and I remember exactly where I was working.</sentence><sentence id="1739">But I couldn't remember that <span class="NPIP">place</span> what it looked like or who was with me.</sentence><sentence id="1740">Because very shortly after that one Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 36 November 29, 2012 day we went from work, which was around, I say you know that it was in, still in February but nobody wants to believe me.</sentence><sentence id="1741">We went from work and we were standing to go in and as we were standing the siren sounded and they told you that the flyers were already crossing the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and that was called a full alarm.</sentence><sentence id="1742">And we told the guard who was a soldier and he was a nice guy.</sentence><sentence id="1743">He was a decent guy.</sentence><sentence id="1744">He was kind of heavy rotund and we called him puppy and we said puppy look, there's an air raid.</sentence><sentence id="1745">Can't we go in.</sentence><sentence id="1746">and he says you know I cannot let you go in because you have to be counted.</sentence><sentence id="1747">And as we were standing there it became a full alarm.</sentence><sentence id="1748">That meant the flyers really are already over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the bombs started to fall.</sentence><sentence id="1749">And it killed puppy but of course he wasn't killed by the bomb but he was quite killed by the flak.</sentence><sentence id="1750">The girl next to me, her name was Tuli Klasa, she was killed and I started running like crazy to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining hall</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1751">And to this day nobody wants to own up whose <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> it was.</sentence><sentence id="1752">Do you know?</sentence><sentence id="1753">They used to fly over us.</sentence><sentence id="1754">It was in the spring of 45, when they were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> to <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1755">So they were going over us every day.</sentence><sentence id="1756">And because near us was a <span class="BUILDING">power station</span> and this was like you know at that time radar didn't work so well.</sentence><sentence id="1757">But this was a point they knew they had to fly over in order to go to the, on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1758">And, but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was gone and because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was gone, they had to move us.</sentence><sentence id="1759">And they left us there a few days.</sentence><sentence id="1760">There was like a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and we were sleeping there on some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="1761">More <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1762">Because also luck was that we were the only ones who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1763">The others, because it was early like must have been 4:30 so the girls still didn't come back from work.</sentence><sentence id="1764">They worked outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> except we were near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1765">Yet nobody, only a few people was hurt and a few people was killed.</sentence><sentence id="1766">Otherwise everybody would have been gone.</sentence><sentence id="1767">And it was one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> which went in, got into trouble and had to let go.</sentence><sentence id="1768">In order to save the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and themselves they had to get rid of the bomb.</sentence><sentence id="1769">And they fell on us.</sentence><sentence id="1770">And I tried to find out about this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1771">I wrote to a number of <span class="BUILDING">war museums</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and they don't know anything about it.</sentence><sentence id="1772">I wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">war museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and there was such a clever guy who said sent me back an email.</sentence><sentence id="1773">I should go to my <span class="BUILDING">home office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1774">Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> would be in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I could go to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1775">He had no idea what I was talking about.</sentence><sentence id="1776">So til this day nobody wants to own up and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">war museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span> and I spoke to an officer and I said I'd like to know what happened to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was gone and because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was gone, we were moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1777">And there half of the girls who would have survived died there of typhoid.</sentence><sentence id="1778">So anyways after a few days we went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and as we were Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 37 November 29, 2012 waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there was an air raid.</sentence><sentence id="1779">We were sitting there on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and we just didn't move.</sentence><sentence id="1780">I mean we are not afraid of air raids.</sentence><sentence id="1781">And we couldn't go anywhere because -- and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and early in the morning we arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1782">We didn't know where it was.</sentence><sentence id="1783">And we had to carry some jackets or something.</sentence><sentence id="1784">Air force, it was heavy like <span class="NPIP">hell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1785">And we schlepped it to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then we arrived in the morning.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1848">Q: What day was this, do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1850">A: That I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1851">I am saying the things that I am saying but nobody wants to corroborate it with me that it was sometimes in end of February.</sentence><sentence id="1852">And they said it isn't so but my figure I'm sure it's so.</sentence><sentence id="1853">And when we arrived they had a <span class="DLF">block</span> there and there was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1854">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> no nothing and we had to lie on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and it was terrible because one was lying on top of the other and when you had to go the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> you had to step one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1855">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> didn't work and we had no water.</sentence><sentence id="1856">We had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1857">There was nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1858">It was complete chaos there.</sentence><sentence id="1859">I mean most of the people were dead.</sentence><sentence id="1860">It was typhoid was --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1861">Q: This is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> you're talking about.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1862">A: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> yes.</sentence><sentence id="1863">It was horrendous.</sentence><sentence id="1864">We hardly got anything to eat and water was, there was no water.</sentence><sentence id="1865">As I told you, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> didn't -- I mean you couldn't even go.</sentence><sentence id="1866">You know we went around the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1867">It was terrible because -- it was just awful.</sentence><sentence id="1868">And then one day there was a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1869">And we didn't know the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> was full of corpses.</sentence><sentence id="1870">And they made us drag those corpses to a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> because they wanted you know, they knew that they had to, that they're going to lose so they wanted to clean it up kind of.</sentence><sentence id="1871">So we did that and when, certain hours they said enough and so we just dropped the corpse and went back and you saw like a row of corpses lying there and you know you become so not feeling.</sentence><sentence id="1872">You know you become so nothing.</sentence><sentence id="1873">You know, you know that it's goes on, this is what you're going to be like and you fight on.</sentence><sentence id="1874">And then the Germans ran away.</sentence><sentence id="1875">And then they brought in Hungarian soldiers.</sentence><sentence id="1876">And they didn't give us anything to eat either.</sentence><sentence id="1877">So we went, tried to find some food and the Germans had storage.</sentence><sentence id="1878">You know they stored potatoes and turnips and things like that under straw.</sentence><sentence id="1879">Like earth and straw Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 38 November 29, 2012 and it was like, like big <span class="DLF">graves</span> you know but a huge thing.</sentence><sentence id="1880">So we went there to dig it up and these damned Hungarians they started shooting and they killed girls.</sentence><sentence id="1881">And you know what, it's a funny thing.</sentence><sentence id="1882">I'm the only one who remembers that.</sentence><sentence id="1883">When you will read anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiesstack</span> they don't talk that Hungarians were there, but they were there.</sentence><sentence id="1884">Anyway and then they left.</sentence><sentence id="1885">And then there was no one.</sentence><sentence id="1886">There were just a few of us who still were able to walk around.</sentence><sentence id="1887">And they were (sound skip) including myself and we felt that Red Cross must be coming.</sentence><sentence id="1888">You know somebody must be coming so we wanted to prepare for that.</sentence><sentence id="1889">We found a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1890">Believe you me it was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1891">And it was hard for us to carry that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1892">We carried it on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> to the entrance of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1893">And as we were standing at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> somebody started shooting at us and the girl next to me was shot at but the bullet went into -- she had a blouse with a, with a pad and it went into the pad, but nothing happened to her and as we were standing there a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> arrived with a white star.</sentence><sentence id="1894">Who the hell knew what it was?</sentence><sentence id="1895">You know we have no idea what it was.</sentence><sentence id="1896">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">turret</span> opened and there was this young man and he said that the division of all the allies came to liberate us.</sentence><sentence id="1897">He said it in German.</sentence><sentence id="1898">Atdalem Aleit Mezhde [German expression -- ph] he said and they started driving in and the soldiers came walking.</sentence><sentence id="1899">And I spoke a little English already at that time.</sentence><sentence id="1900">And he told, the first thing he told me is that Roosevelt died.</sentence><sentence id="1901">Because Roosevelt died on the 12"" and we were liberated on the 15".</sentence><sentence id="1902">And I like an idiot was crying.</sentence><sentence id="1903">I never cried throughout my whole three years but I cried.</sentence><sentence id="1904">So now when I give a lecture, I tell the children that I am ashamed of my tears because Mr.Roosevelt could have saved thousands of Jews and he didn't do anything so that's why I'm ashamed of my tears.</sentence><sentence id="1905">Anyway so this British army came in.</sentence><sentence id="1906">This was the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they liberated and they saw the horror because most people were dead and there were thousands of them.</sentence><sentence id="1907">And they got in touch with their <span class="BUILDING">head office</span> and the first thing they did, they put up <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1908">So at least we could get washed.</sentence><sentence id="1909">And there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> not far from where we were.</sentence><sentence id="1910">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span>, which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">armory town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1911">Of course the German soldiers were not there anymore and that they changed into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hospital town</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1912">And they tried to take us all the sick people first so I was, you know I wasn't sick.</sentence><sentence id="1913">I was walking around.</sentence><sentence id="1914">So you should have seen.</sentence><sentence id="1915">They put down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span>, the soldiers put down a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1916">Before you knew there were ten naked ladies lying there because you were not allowed to take any of their clothes because it was full of lice.</sentence><sentence id="1917">Right.</sentence><sentence id="1918">Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 39 November 29, 2012 Anyway so I was one of the last ones going out.</sentence><sentence id="1919">And we're coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> and there was a square and I was put up with some other girls in one of these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1920">And there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I don't know how smart I got, said I'm going to go and work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1921">So I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1922">And I stole some butter and I put it in my chest and I ran <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I wanted to bring it to the girls butter.</sentence><sentence id="1923">And before I came it was running down.</sentence><sentence id="1924">Anyway, so then the Red Cross started coming and they had clothes for us because after all we had nothing and I got a leather jacket.</sentence><sentence id="1925">It was an old leather jacket, but it was a leather jacket.</sentence><sentence id="1926">I got Eisenhower jacket.</sentence><sentence id="1927">Yes, oh yes, but my director on our own before we were liberated, there was nobody, we couldn't walk around and there were <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1928">You have no idea what the Germans had <span

otherwise I would have been dead a long time ago.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2914">And right now I'm sick and I'm very much alone and that is worse than anything else you can

92.</sentence><sentence id="2916">And he is now in a <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>, but in a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2917">And I phone him and he cries.</sentence><sentence id="2918">He doesn't stop crying.</sentence><sentence id="2919">He says you know what.</sentence><sentence id="2920">When I was young I did all these things and now this, it doesn't leave me and I'm just a wreck.</sentence><sentence id="2921">And so it comes back more than before.</sentence><sentence id="2922">It haunts us much more.</sentence><sentence id="2923">And this is the bad part.</sentence><sentence id="2924">And you see, a person like you can understand it.</sentence><sentence id="2925">But how could you tell that to your

class="Question"><p><sentence id="2935">Q: You did?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2936">A: Yes, I met her cousin in, Dasha, I met her cousin in 1998 I believe because this friend of mine whom I told you.</sentence><sentence id="2937">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> at the same time and he was standing in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and I phoned him and he says come on over.</sentence><sentence id="2938">I have a visitor here.</sentence><sentence id="2939">Come on over.</sentence><sentence id="2940">So I went to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and her cousin Dasha was there and we talked, you know but nothing much.</sentence><sentence id="2941">You know like visiting in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2942">You talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> or whatever it was.</sentence><sentence id="2943">Because he comes from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dasha</span>, and he knew her as a young girl and her parents.</sentence><sentence id="2944">Her father was their family doctor.</sentence><sentence id="2945">And so he says I have to go now.</sentence><sentence id="2946">He says I have to go now too -- and so she left and we went downstairs and we crossed the Mensa square and I said to her, tell me, how can she say that she didn't know she was Jewish.</sentence><sentence id="2947">So she said to me, my mother, her daughter said, mommy when she looks in the mirror, doesn't she see who she is?</sentence><sentence id="2948">You know.</sentence><sentence id="2949">I tell you.</sentence><sentence id="2950">I cannot understand it.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2951">She came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> in 1947.</sentence><sentence id="2952">That means she was ten years old.</sentence><sentence id="2953">Her cousin Dasha who was older came back at the same time from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and her cousin Dasha, her parents weren't there.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2954">They were all killed.</sentence><sentence id="2955">And her grandparents.</sentence><sentence id="2956">Didn't she ask what happened to uncle so and so?</sentence><sentence id="2957">I mean even you are ten years old.</sentence><sentence id="2958">You know the bad person is her father.</sentence><sentence id="2959">I hate him because he was such a bureaucrat.</sentence><sentence id="2960">He didn't want that anything should interfere with his climb.</sentence><sentence id="2961">He wanted to become ambassador.</sentence><sentence id="2962">You know being a Jew he was afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2963">Maybe they wouldn't promote him you know.</sentence><sentence id="2964">So they all became, they all were baptized in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2965">I mean she's such a smart woman.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2966">Not only that, she was teaching history so didn't she teach history what was going on in Europe.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2967">Didn't she know?</sentence><sentence id="2968">I mean how could, if I] would meet her I would say Mrs. Albright you are such a smart person but you are such a damn liar.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2969">Anyway what I am doing now research on, in her books, if you seem to have the book, on page 276 there is an article, by (sound skip) by the name of Eugena Smolkova that she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and she was pulled out by an SS man and that's how she survived.</sentence><sentence id="2970">You know went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2971">This is a bloody lie.</sentence><sentence id="2972">Because we were not, we were not in the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span>, we were selected in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2973">And when she arrived she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niue Graden</span> which is a lie too because we went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, we went first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Freihaven</span>, and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niue Graden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2974">So the whole thing doesn't make sense.</sentence><sentence id="2975">And not only that, you know I have the book where everybody is listed who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span>, to, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> right?</sentence></p><p><sentence id="2977">Interview with Liselotte Epstein Ivry 56 November 29, 2012</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2978">Q: Right.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2979">A: I cannot find her.</sentence><sentence id="2980">They cannot find her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">beit Terezin</span> so we don't know who she is.</sentence><sentence id="2981">She writes there that no, that she, her daughter is working for a Mrs. Albright.</sentence><sentence id="2982">So I told your friend Michaela, I said why don't you ask this daughter which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2983">Because we cannot find her.</sentence><sentence id="2984">Her name is Eugena Smolkova.</sentence><sentence id="2985">We cannot find her anywhere.</sentence><sentence id="2986">So this is my latest thing and I want to write to the publisher.</sentence><sentence id="2987">And I don't want to say they should change it now, but in case there's a reprint.</sentence><sentence id="2988">Either you leave the whole thing out or say the truth how it is, because Eugena Smolkova can't be found to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
