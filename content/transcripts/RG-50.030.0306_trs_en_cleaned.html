<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="70">Q: What <span class="NPIP">year</span> was this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="72">A: It was in "38 to "39.</sentence><sentence id="73">I remember being--just coming in, and then suddenly they would, they would attack bearded Jews in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and then if they saw somebody that they thought lived in that <span class="REGION">area</span>, they would just beat them up, too.</sentence><sentence id="74">And that happened.</sentence><sentence id="75">That's about all, but there were a number of Zionist movements and even Revisionist* movements, so that the Jews had quite a free life there.</sentence><sentence id="76">The government had no discrimination, officially.</sentence><sentence id="77">Of course, if you wanted to have certain jobs, then there were discriminations, so, in general, I would say <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> had a certain enlightened attitude towards the Jews.</sentence><sentence id="78">We were not affected, other than by having those 10,000 refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, by what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until May the 10th.</sentence><sentence id="79">When we woke up and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> was bombed by the Germans and we discovered we were at war, we were invaded.</sentence><sentence id="80">It was very fast and the 13th or 14th of May they had already reached almost the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span>.</sentence><sentence id="81"><span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> is very small and as you know, the king capitulated within a week, I think.</sentence><sentence id="82">Because we had a small <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> right at the sea shore, my father took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and just left everything in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and reached that <span class="NPIP">place</span>, but we stayed only there for one day, because we heard that the Germans had already occupied, were already reaching the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span>, and so we followed the flow of those thousands of refugees that clogged the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and occasionally were attacked by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span>, you know, just came down, swooping down and machine-gunned the refugees.</sentence><sentence id="83">And I had a small-- my brother is 15 years younger, so I had him.</sentence><sentence id="84">He had whooping cough and I was just carrying him on my back and he was just having his spells on my back and vomiting on us.</sentence><sentence id="85">It was a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we used to be on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and then hide, jumping off the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and just going by foot.</sentence><sentence id="86">The French at first hadn't opened the, hadn't opened the <span class="DLF">border</span>, so we were camping there for I think two days without having food or anything and then suddenly they opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we could come down to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="87">Somehow I thought that--because everybody was going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arras</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">northern cities</span> near the <span class="DLF">border</span> because they hoped that they would get to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>.</sentence><sentence id="88">We--my father--found some kind of a private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and they brought us down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">And we found later on that most of those refugees who tried to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arras</span> were bombed at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and killed.</sentence><sentence id="90">He managed to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and we stayed there for one night when my father again heard that we had to register as refugees, especially if we weren't Belgian, and so he went to the police.</sentence><sentence id="91">There he--that's when he had--at first he was a very great admirer of the French, he thought they were--the French revolution was really the representatives of what a republic should mean--and a freedom-loving republic.</sentence><sentence id="92">And that's when he had--the first time, he asked, and he said that we would like to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> if we could, and the man said, "You dirty Jew," and hit him and said, "You better report tomorrow to the--" what they call the caserne de tourelles,deg which is a <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span>, where then we found that all the refugees were being channeled towards various parts of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">The second time that we realized how antisemitic actually police was, was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>.</sentence><sentence id="94">There were many refugees from all <span class="NPIP">over</span>, most Jews.</sentence><sentence id="95">And <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was then a Fascist country and was just going into, was then entering the war.</sentence><sentence id="96">There was an Italian worker who was totally uneducated.</sentence><sentence id="97">The police was assigning to each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>, you know, a person in charge, and I say my father was the most educated person in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and he was a really respectable-looking man, but they took the Italian worker who was drunk and uneducated and put him in charge because, he said it openly, "I'm not going to put any Jew in charge of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span>."</sentence><sentence id="98">So that was the thing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: How long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: Only 48 hours I think--72 hours.</sentence><sentence id="130">Because we--they-- didn't want to have Jewish refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span>, and so they evacuated and we went with other Belgian non-Jews into-- we ended up after a long ordeal on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> in <span class="REGION">central France</span>, in the Ardeche.</sentence><sentence id="131">It's a small state, a small department, which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> had about 4,000 inhabitants and we ended up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> where we stayed for three months over the summer.</sentence><sentence id="132">It was a <span class="DLF">farm</span>, I became a farm boy.</sentence><sentence id="133">As a matter of fact, I keep in touch with the farmer I met.</sentence><sentence id="134">I have been several times to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> 50 years later.</sentence><sentence id="135">He's still alive.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="143">Q: How did you connect with the farmer?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="145">A: Oh, they put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="146">They put us up in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that was--that only worked during the winter because they didn't have electricity and in the winter there was enough water to get the--to farm the--it was a silk, they were doing, something was just silk thread or something--and we were <span class="BUILDING">barracked</span> there, at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="147">And within a few--when in June we came there in May, the end of May.</sentence><sentence id="148">On June 18th, I think, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> capitulated and Petain(r) took over.</sentence><sentence id="149">The Belgian refugees who were non-Jewish were repatriated.</sentence><sentence id="150">There was also another Jewish family who also was--chose to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>.</sentence><sentence id="151">The reason why is because rumor spreads very quickly that there were camps all over <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, especially near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span>, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.617833" long="3.004194">Saint-Cyprien</span>, Anjouleme, Corse, where the conditions were extremely difficult, and they said they were very harsh towards the Jews in particular, and so we heard about it.</sentence><sentence id="152">And as a matter of fact, we heard that the oldest sister of my mother, her husband, her daughter, and her grandchild were there, and there were conditions so bad that they also chose to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="153">And when 5 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Barracks turret</span> (French).</sentence><sentence id="154">6 Petain, Henri (1856-1951); French marshal who corroborated with the Nazis and lead the French Vichy government during W.W.II.</sentence><sentence id="155">Bruce Wetterau, World History (New York: Henry Holt Publishing, 1994), 838.</sentence><sentence id="158">another Jewish family in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called Saint-Julien du Corse, population including I think the animals, was 600 people; but it was spread over miles and miles.</sentence><sentence id="159">It's a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span>.</sentence><sentence id="160">We chose to stay there, until the winter came, in which we then moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span>, which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brive</span>.</sentence><sentence id="161">And there we--suddenly on November, I think in November, were told that we had to report to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span>, the next morning, just to take the bare essentials, leave everything else and leave and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span>.</sentence><sentence id="162">And that's in November "40.</sentence><sentence id="163">We then reported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence><sentence id="164">That was a real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="497">Q: How did you know this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="499">A: Because the daughter, because the daughter of the oldest sister of my mother, she managed to get--to smuggle out with her daughter, to get from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to the <span class="REGION">occupied area</span> and from the <span class="REGION">occupied area</span> to the non-occupied and because of that cousin of mine, Michael, who was in the army, everybody knew, had followed him.</sentence><sentence id="500">Because they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theonville</span> and then they went to <span

go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> and we knew that the son of one of my--had also reported, and then one of the other sons, who is still now in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, he jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>--from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span>--and came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and told that woman, that daughter, and then she subsequently was deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lyon</span>.</sentence><sentence id="503">So that's how we knew what happened to our family in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and we all knew that they were sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so that's how we--but also the, there were some people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> that my father was in touch with, Jews, and not the French.</sentence><sentence id="504">The French Jews kept apart.</sentence><sentence id="505">They thought they were not going to be touched; it was only the foreign Jews.</sentence><sentence id="506">But the foreign community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span> knew about it and the <span class="BUILDING">rumor mill</span> went and you see when we had my cousin Hela, the one that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, and she told us about all these people who had been deported.</sentence><sentence id="507">They always said they had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moulins</span> they were sent away and we also knew about that boy, my cousin, who was my age, just a little younger, that

cousin who's husband--who had just been</sentence><sentence id="510">0 married just before the war--who's husband had been again sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, so we knew about those things, but we didn't know.</sentence><sentence id="511">I mean, we all had this picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.269612" long="11.468478">Dachau</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="51.021507" long="11.249238">Buchenwald</span>, which we knew from before the war.</sentence><sentence id="512">The horrible things happened, the people starved to death, you know and they're worked, and also two of my cousins had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> and again the one that jumped from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> told us about it, so we knew about it, but I can't precisely know how it happens.</sentence><sentence id="513">And then we saw <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span> was a horrible camp and we knew also that the majority of the people who had been sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"

about it.</sentence><sentence id="515">It's funny thing is--because I didn't hear from Rivesaltes after that and then I had a book here about the camps in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they say the result is the major source of deportees of the zone libre"*--non-occupied.</sentence><sentence id="516">All right?</sentence><sentence id="517">And we go on and then when we got in in July of

with all the students for mandatory work in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>.</sentence><sentence id="525">I was working at that time near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montpellier</span>, in a big

class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span>, I also managed to get some kind of a certificate from my father--a medical certificate that he was ill, so when they couldn't get me, the young guy, because I was, I was, they couldn't supersede the ruler, the government's rule of service.</sentence><sentence id="530">They let me go, so I didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span>, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span> the second time, but they let me go and since they couldn't get me.</sentence><sentence id="531">They let my father go, too.</sentence><sentence id="532">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="43.312444" long="3.470833">Agde</span> then had just been a sort of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span> to send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="42.768583" long="2.87175">Rivesaltes</span> out again.</sentence><sentence id="533">And so I went back and I went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> with my group.</sentence><sentence id="534">Did a stupid thing because I went without the pass, and when I was there
