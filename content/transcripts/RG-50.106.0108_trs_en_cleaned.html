<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="41">A: Today is the anniversary, yes.</sentence><sentence id="42">My father came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> about 1943, he was an officer in the Polish army and participated in the effort to recruit volunteers during the war, prior to Pearl Harbor.</sentence><sentence id="43">But of course -- and he was located with a mission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span>, <span class="REGION">Ontario</span>, across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>, but obviously with the advent of American Japanese war, the mission lost its purpose</sentence><sentence id="45">and liquidated its activities and most of the people returned to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and Europe.</sentence><sentence id="46">However, my father was offered a job in the war industry, he was a chemical engineer and they were highly sought at the time, so he was admitted to the <span class="INT_SPACE">United States cell</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">By the time the war ended, he was making all sorts of efforts to try to find whether we survived the war and where we a -- where are we and obviously trying to bring us over.</sentence><sentence id="48">Us meaning my mother, my younger sister and myself.</sentence><sentence id="49">Th-The first and obvious step was to apply for passports and permission to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="50">My mother received that from the government, who -- which at the time was a purportedly government of national unity, but it was only a transitional period before the communists could solidify their grip on that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and on the government, and they gave permission to my mother to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and join her husband in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span>, but did not give a permission to the two children, ages at that time, what was it, 1948?</sentence><sentence id="51">I was 20, my sister was 18.</sentence><sentence id="52">So I determined to escape from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and through contacts, family contacts, underground connections, I managed to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish coal freighter</span>, which was leaving Polish port city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdynia</span> and was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="53">I guess the excitement of actually trying to escape and join my father was so overwhelming that I did not have any nostalgic or any reflective thoughts about leaving my <span class="REGION">native land</span>.</sentence><sentence id="54">To me it was escape from a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span>, which was becoming worse and worse.</sentence><sentence id="57">And I was going first so that my sister could follow me on what we thought naively would be a safe route.</sentence><sentence id="58">And of course, I managed, I succeeded, my sister didn't and was caught by the communists and briefly imprisoned.</sentence><sentence id="59">So, the feelings were not dramatic at all, except in terms of excitement and going to my father, whom I had not seen for 10 years.</sentence><sentence id="60">And I think I described in my previous interview, some of the feelings that I had when I was arriving in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and trying to locate my father.</sentence><sentence id="61">But that, pretty much, I think should answer your first question.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="85">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence><sentence id="86">So, then you were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with your father and later joined by your mother and your sister.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: [had two years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> English, so you can appreciate.</sentence><sentence id="94">A similar experience to American kids learning foreign languages in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">It is essentially a very, very superficial knowledge of -- of language.</sentence><sentence id="96">I walked around with a dictionary in my hand wherever I went, so that I-- you could --I could look up words and communicate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="101">Q: You were how old?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="107">A: I turned 21, you may recall from the interview, I managed to arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> three days before my birthday, my 21" birthday, on which the then American immigration law would cut me off as a minor child of an American citizen and would make me wait for a number of years before I could get under a Polish quota.</sentence><sentence id="108">But up until January 12, 1949, I could come in non-quota, and I made it within three days before the deadline.</sentence><sentence id="109">I was very fortunate.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="113">Q: So you were able to become a citizen?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="115">A: In due time.</sentence><sentence id="116">I -- I -- in thr -- the law at that time -- I was married in 1951, two years later, and as a husband of an American citizen, I didn't have to wait five years, I could become a citizen after three years.</sentence><sentence id="117">But I did not automatically become a U.S. citizen as a minor child.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="127">Q: You don't speak very much English.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="129">A: And I am several years older than my contemporaries, because the first thing that I did is to enroll again in an <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span>, and had [indecipherable] to be sure, and try to graduate from an <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span>, even though I was already</sentence><sentence id="131">a graduate of <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span>, and I had attended first semester of a <span class="BUILDING">polytechnic</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="150">Q: And how were you received by other kids?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="152">A: The other kids were very, very nice.</sentence><sentence id="153">Curious, open, positive.</sentence><sentence id="154">It was especially more -- more reflective, more thoughtful.</sentence><sentence id="155">Kids tried to befriend me, tried to learn something from me.</sentence><sentence id="156">I-It was very interesting and very positive.</sentence><sentence id="157">I have encountered absolutely no -- no negative reception.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="164">Q: Were there other refugee children in your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="166">A: In my particular <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, no.</sentence><sentence id="167">I found some other people who survived the war from Europe in my college years at <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="170">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="176">A: Thad one particular friend, whose name of course, now escapes me.</sentence><sentence id="177">But at the time, I discovered that he was a young Jewish boy, maybe a few years younger than I, but who attended the <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span>, who told me about his war experiences, and he was Jewish and his mother, in the last couple years of war, kept him in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barrel</span> somewhere.</sentence><sentence id="178">It -- and he lived in a barrel and that stayed with me.</sentence><sentence id="179">But in <span class="BUILDING">Hamtramck High School</span>, it was just the typical <span class="BUILDING">American high school</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="184">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="186">A: Proud, and loafers with pennies in them and stuff like this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="188">Q: What appealed to you in particular about being in that <span class="BUILDING">high school</span>, having those friends, being in that teenage -- well, you weren't a teenage -- but being -- it was a teenage culture.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="190">A: Oh, the girls were very pretty by my standards.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="192">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="194">A: And I -- that was probably the most positive thing and -- and I remember -- I was just reflecting on it recently that I took to the <span class="BUILDING">prom</span> a lovely Hispanic looking girl that was just absolutely beautiful and I barely knew her, but I asked her to go to the prom with me, and she did.</sentence><sentence id="195">The negative feelings were awareness of great loneliness, because I didn't really fit with the crowd, didn't do anything with them, e-except encountered them in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="196">And I did achieve a sort of a fame</sentence><sentence id="198">when in the <span class="BUILDING">speech class</span>, by good old -- run by good old Mrs. Homestead, I was given an assignment to learn and recite a poem, and I did.</sentence><sentence id="199">And in perfected English, which came with considerable difficulty at the time, I managed to impress the class.</sentence><sentence id="200">Forget what it was.</sentence><sentence id="201">How do I love thee, I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="211">Q: And so it took awhile before you were comfortable with English?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="213">A: There are two curious stages that I believe not only I, but a number of people that I spoke, who -- to -- to who were in a similar situation, go through.</sentence><sentence id="214">One is, you begin to --1--I forget which came first.</sentence><sentence id="215">You begin to dream in English and then you begin to think in English.</sentence><sentence id="216">Maybe thinking comes first and then you begin to dream in English.</sentence><sentence id="217">And then you make this great, slow transition that is so wonderfully described by a woman who became quite a celebrity, the author of the book, "Lost in Translation," Eva Hoffman.</sentence><sentence id="218">I enjoyed that book very much.</sentence><sentence id="219">Very, very similar experiences in some ways, and in some ways different.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="227">Q: Mm-hm.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="229">A: Within two years, because in spite of the -- in spite of being with the father, I felt estranged from him.</sentence><sentence id="230">He wanted me to be 11 year old that he left behind, and I was 21.</sentence><sentence id="231">So that may have contributed to my th -- early decision to -- to marry, and I met a lovely Polish American girl who spoke Polish and whose parents were very, very interested in her marrying a -- a Polish fellow, of course.</sentence><sentence id="232">So I did that, sort of -- well,</sentence><sentence id="234">this was the first girl I knew really intimately and so I married in 1951, and th-- even though we were both in <span class="BUILDING">college</span>, the children came.</sentence><sentence id="235">First my son, born in 52, then my first daughter, born in "53.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="243">Q: And what are their names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="245">A: Matthew and Elizabeth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="247">Q: So those are not Polish names?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="249">A: Well, he was called Maczik(ph) and she was called Elzunia(ph), which is ina diminutive form, Elizabeth.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="251">Q: But their actual legal names were?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="253">A: Oh, Elizabeth and Matthew.</sentence><sentence id="254">Which is curious because the two girls born of the second marriage, 20 years later, have their legal names in Polish, even though their mother was not Polish at all.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: So was that mainly your idea, or mainly your wife's idea?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="259">A: No, I--I went along with the -- with the -- it was a joint decision of the wife and --and myself to -- to give them that -- that identity, which first they hated and then they loved it when they discovered -- my daughter, my middle daughter, Krisha(ph) got into the <span class="BUILDING">University of Virginia</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charlottesville</span>, I'm convinced, by writing a very beautiful essay on how to -- how it feels to be a child of -- of the Polish immigrant.</sentence><sentence id="260">And that was a very impressive piece of writing.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="265">Q: So, with your second family you were more focused on your Polish roots, would you say?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="266">A: I wouldn't say that that was the case.</sentence><sentence id="267">If anything, in the second family, I was more focused on being a better father, because the second family -- the first family was -- and life of the first family was characterized by an intense effort to become Americanized.</sentence><sentence id="268">To learn the language, learn the language well, be able to command it.</sentence><sentence id="269">After all, I decided to become a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="270">And the second and -- and the -- and the fathering or the parenting was largely traditional in the first marriage and -- and largely unexamined.</sentence><sentence id="271">And so I now, in retrospect of 70 years of age, I think that I was a much better father second time around.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="278">Q: Going back to your earlier years in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, how did you decide to go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="280">A: Hm.</sentence><sentence id="281">I was first interested in speech and government and | studied a number of courses.</sentence><sentence id="282">But by chance again, which I don't believe in, I was offered a job as a young assistant to two elderly gentlemen who were conducting a Polish radio program on <span class="BUILDING">WJLB station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="283">At that time this was one of the <span class="BUILDING">booth stations</span> that specialized in ethnic programs.</sentence><sentence id="284">And every morning there were one or two hours of Polish language programs.</sentence><sentence id="285">Music, news, advertising.</sentence><sentence id="286">And I started as a</sentence><sentence id="288">Interview with Wallace Witkowski 8 September 1, 1998 -- of what you call today, a disc jockey.</sentence><sentence id="289">And then finally wound up, while already in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and using a nom de plume, giving news commentaries.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="301">Q: What was your nom de plume?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="303">A: Well, Jan Alexander, which was sort of a compromise.</sentence><sentence id="304">It could have been Polish, it could have been some other nationality, so we -- we -- I deliberately fudged it a little bit.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="307">Q: Did you -- you choose the name?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="309">A: I think -- I think I did.</sentence><sentence id="310">Some -- something struck me.</sentence><sentence id="311">I seem to recall that the reason I chose it was deliberate, but it was a connection to either the Polish -- first Polish newspaper which -- which was published in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> over 300 years ago, or s --in--there was some reason, there was some rational -- there was some rationale behind choosing that particular assumed name to broadcast under.</sentence><sentence id="312">So that was, at that time -- however, I looked at the broadcasting and I did not see much future for the ethnic broadcasting, I felt that it would keep me a little bit too much in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ethnic community</span> and I wanted to -- not to limit myself.</sentence><sentence id="313">And I married --</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="314">Q: Wh-When you were broadcasting, were -- were you broadcasting in Polish?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="315">A: In Polish, yes, so I continued my Polish and that's why I was -- I was picked by the owners of the program because I had good diction, good ra -- what we called the radiophonic voice and therefore they thought that was a good addition of a good,</sentence><sentence id="317">fresh voice to their broadcast.</sentence><sentence id="318">And the young lady that I married, her father was a lawyer.</sentence><sentence id="319">And so I worked part time in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> as a clerk, and then I thought hm, I like dealing with people, I like helping people, I-- why not?</sentence><sentence id="320">And so I -- by that time I was in the third year of my college education at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wayne</span>.</sentence><sentence id="321">And at that time <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span> had a so-called combined curriculum.</sentence><sentence id="322">If you could maintain a certain level of grades, B minus I think it was, in the first year -- first three years of undergraduate studies, you could go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>, and assuming that you maintain your level of grades in the first year of <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>, you would then receive credit for the f-fourth year of undergraduate sta -- study and get your B.A., which is what I did.</sentence><sentence id="323">And then two more years and then I had my L.B., which was later changed retrospectively to J.D., juris doctor, doctor of laws.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="334">Q: And where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="336">A: Same <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span>, since I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>.</sentence><sentence id="337">I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State</span> in 19 -- from the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in 1956.</sentence><sentence id="338">And for the next six years, I joined my father-in-law in private practice, which was mostly probate and real estate and very simple neighborhood ethnic -- ethnic practice because obviously we turned our bilingual skills into assets by -- by working with the Polish community.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="342">Q: So you often dealt with your clients in the Polish language?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</sentence><sentence id="349">Towards the last two years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span>, around 1960 or so, I was even appointed by two successive mayors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> as a member of the community relations commission, which was a so-called racial commission.</sentence><sentence id="350"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> had a very checkered history of racial relations and they wanted some -- they -- they -- people appointed people to these commissions.</sentence><sentence id="351">They wanted representatives of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ethnic communities</span> to kind of dialog and -- and work together on racial problems of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>.</sentence><sentence id="352">But then, of course, I had to resign from that commission and give up my practice when in 1962 I was offered a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, which was to last three years, and it was again in -- in the area of both languages, because it was handling the claims for World War II losses by the -- by the American nationals who suffered these losses in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and it required knowledge of Polish.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="358">Q: Now these would be American citizens, probably of Polish descent who had property [indecipherable]</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="359">A: Most of the claimants, interestingly enough, were survivors of the owners of property in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, very often relatives, a substantial number of them Jewish, who laid claims to compensation for reasons that the whole family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was wiped out by the Nazis, that they were the next of kin now.</sentence><sentence id="360">But there were a number of requirements.</sentence><sentence id="361">The ownership of the property in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had to be established to -- ownership had to be established that it -- let me start again.</sentence><sentence id="362">Owners had to be</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="371">Interview with Wallace Witkowski 6 September 1, 1998 American nationals at the time of loss, they could not have had it -- it's a legal issue that I don't go into because it -- I don't think it's -- it's too technical.</sentence><sentence id="372">If someone subsequently became an American citizen, it didn't count because he was not a citizen of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the time of loss.</sentence><sentence id="373">The language of the agreement between the United States government and government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, communist government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> specified that these losses, these claims will be compensated only to the extent to -- to -- to -- to which the owners were Americans at the time of loss.</sentence><sentence id="374">Do dogs bother you, Marcia?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="385">Q: And the content of the work, did that have appeal for you?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="387">A: That was very, very appealing from the point of view, not only being interesting, but also permitted me to utilize my knowledge of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, my knowledge of Polish history, my knowledge and insight into -- of character of many of these losses.</sentence><sentence id="388">Maybe not so much the character of the losses as being able to deliver to my <span class="COUNTRY">government</span> a -- a f--a---a sort of a sober objective, hopefully, assessment of not</sentence><sentence id="390">only the possibility that these people really lost claims.</sentence><sentence id="391">There were a lot of outrageous claims that were based on total fiction sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="392">And being able to -- to assist my superiors in saying that this is not probable, we better check this through our <span class="BUILDING">field office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="393">And in fact, in 1963, within a year, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> for three months to help run the <span class="BUILDING">field office</span> that was verifying claims of American citizens by going through the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, checking the land records if they existed, checking, investigating with the neighbors and people who still lived there, whether such and such family really owned the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> or really had the <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> or -- or -- or owned the -- an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span>, and that was very rewarding, I-I think.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="404">A: It was also very gratifying because I went on official passports, so it's a native boy who -- who did well, comes back with the official U.S. passport, not the tourist passport.</sentence><sentence id="405">And I was given all the privileges of the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span> and | --i-it was an accomplishment.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="410">A: Oh, I had many, many aunts and first cousins and we got together, it was a great time.</sentence><sentence id="411">It was also a lot of fun, in addition to working very hard and trying to -- trying to adjudicate -- not adjudicate, but recommend an adjudication of these claims.</sentence><sentence id="412">So it was a very good experience, from a professional point of view, which later qualified</sentence><sentence id="414">Interview with Wallace Witkowski a September 1, 1998 me to be offered a job in <span class="REGION">Western Pacific</span> when -- when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> in deg70, which I men -- may have mentioned before.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="484">A: It's very hard to articulate, but any person born abroad, coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, tries very hard to become Americanized, at least it's a typical, let's say, pattern.</sentence><sentence id="485">I mean, there will be staunch individualists who will refuse to become American, they will</sentence><sentence id="487">be French or they will be German, or they will be this and that, for reasons of either because they think that their ethnic background or cultural background is superior to the American -- many, many foreigners come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with a rather superior feeling about their own culture.</sentence><sentence id="488">It's a defense mechanism of sort, I believe.</sentence><sentence id="489">Here, I was trying to absorb American values, American customs, American tradition.</sentence><sentence id="490">I wanted my children to be American, after all, they are my roots in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="491">I simply wanted to be able to live in this society and function in this society the best I could.</sentence><sentence id="492">Returning from <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> made me aware that I don't have to prove to myself anything, or climb yet another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span>, or -- for example, when I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span>, I resumed my career at the Federal Trade Commission, and there I discovered that I really don't care about the antitrust in which I was working at the time, that it dealt with economic and shifting issues.</sentence><sentence id="493">I spent two or three years battling a -- a ca -- in -- in -- fighting in a case in which the law was changed after -- after a couple years and I felt the -- like standing on a shifting sand.</sentence><sentence id="494">I realized also that I'm not happy not dealing with people.</sentence><sentence id="495">So then I switched in my career to consumer protection, because the Federal Trade Commission has two main functions.</sentence><sentence id="496">The antitrust -- enforcement of the antitrust laws, which it shares with the justice department, and the consumer protection fo -- mission.</sentence><sentence id="497">And I felt much more comfortable in the <span class="REGION">consumer protection area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="498">And in fact, I continued from a year or</sentence><sentence id="500">two after I returned from <span class="COUNTRY">Micronesia</span> until I retired in 1994 -- four.</sentence><sentence id="501">So that was the rest of my career in the government.</sentence><sentence id="502">I -- I was an enforcement attorney, and a senior attorney, thought of well, getting good reviews.</sentence><sentence id="503">But I realized that I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for three years and I stayed in the government 32 years.</sentence><sentence id="504">I was qualified to retire, and I was getting -- I was ready to move on, and in the meantime, personal crises, my second marriage failed also.</sentence><sentence id="505">I started worrying about myself, who am I and what am I doing with my life and what's going on?</sentence><sentence id="506">And I started examining my life probably around the age of 50, not before.</sentence><sentence id="507">By that time I was a father of four.</sentence><sentence id="508">I was bravely putting them through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and supporting them and giving the older children educations.</sentence><sentence id="509">Thank God the two younger ones came 20 years later, I was able to take a breather before the -- the last two daughters went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span>.</sentence><sentence id="510">But I gave all of them education, except that I was examining and beginning to question all the values in which I grew up.</sentence><sentence id="511">I was a churchgoer, I actively participated in a number of activities in the parishes to which I belonged to.</sentence><sentence id="512">But as many contemporaries will tell you, not all of my needs were satisfied.</sentence><sentence id="513">I went into <span class="BUILDING">therapy</span>, first of all, because I really got scared when my second marriage failed and I felt unhappy and I felt alienated and I felt a failure.</sentence><sentence id="514">And so, started my spiritual journey with reading such semi-spiritual but still thought provoking books</sentence><sentence id="516">Interview with Wallace Witkowski degs September 1, 1998 as memoirs of Carl Jung, "Memories, Dreams, Reflections," or even M -- what's his name, ems -- George Peck or Scott Peck?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="553">Q: Scott Peck.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="555">A: Scott Peck, "The Road Less Traveled."</sentence><sentence id="556">One of the unfortunate developments caused by the age that I -- I forget names, <span class="NPIP">places</span>, things.</sentence><sentence id="557">We call it senior moments, but I'm sure you've heard that name before -- that term before.</sentence><sentence id="558">Peck was an influence.</sentence><sentence id="559">A number of other things that I read were also very helpful in beginning to turn to -- to what do I believe in and where am I going and what's happening.</sentence><sentence id="560">And in the meantime I also discovered in therapy, both individual and group that a number of years may have passed since the war, but the experiences, the feelings, the emotional and psychic wounds remained from that period.</sentence><sentence id="561">Not only the fear that absolutely paralyzed many of us for a long period of time during the years of very brutal Nazi occupation, but also a feeling of total helplessness, that there was not much we could do about it.</sentence><sentence id="562">I spoke about the feeling of helplessness when I saw and heard that my friends from <span class="BUILDING">grade school</span> were killed or murdered wa -- together with their parents.</sentence><sentence id="563">I witnessed situations in which I stood there and couldn't do anything while some people were brutalized by other people.</sentence><sentence id="564">I personally cowered when -- when a man in a uniform with a gun in his hand told me to do things, and I had to obey him.</sentence><sentence id="565">Open up my briefcase, show him what I had.</sentence><sentence id="566">That was, by the</sentence><sentence id="568">Interview with Wallace Witkowski 4 September 1, 1998 way, a briefcase in which I carried music.</sentence><sentence id="569">I was, at that time trying to study <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> a little bit, didn't last very long, but I was stopped by a German patrol and the same feeling of being absolutely helpless and violated.</sentence><sentence id="570">These things stay with us and the sense of injustice, a sense of outrage at the power being imposed on you against your will.</sentence><sentence id="571">So perhaps that explains why I chose to work for the government and maybe make less money than in private practice, because eventually in private practice I would have made a lot more money than -- than working for the government, a rigid grade system and all that stuff, you just got so much money and that's it.</sentence><sentence id="572">Although I am not complaining, I was -- I was a high grade and I have a nice, comfortable retirement, which is -- totally satisfies me.</sentence><sentence id="573">Spiritually, I went through a sort of a -- I don't know how to describe it, awakening.</sentence><sentence id="574">I searched for a system of beliefs that would more be responding to my instinctive need to correct something that is wrong, because at times I did not feel sinful, at times I did not feel guilty.</sentence><sentence id="575">Although by the presets of my <span class="BUILDING">church</span>, I was a sinful, guilty lost soul and I had to really try very hard and sacrifice a lot before I would maybe gain salvation.</sentence></p></dialogue>

discovered that there are other people who seriously want to translate the text of this teaching into Polish.</sentence><sentence id="631">There were already at that time going on, translations into a number of other <span class="COUNTRY">languages</span>.</sentence><sentence id="632">And to make the long story short, through a process of submitting samples of translations and reviewing them and commenting on them, the Foundation for Inner Peace, which is a publisher of the course, chose a young man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, young man from my point of view, relatively speaking, the man in his 40's, and -- as a translator and me as an editor of his translation.</sentence><sentence id="633">We essentially were translating and making sure that the trans -- the substance of each sentence, each paragraph and chapter is -- is correctly rendered in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="634">And we just completed the task of translating 1200 pages of a very, very deep metaphysical work.</sentence><sentence id="635">And Friday I will be in the state of New York in -- ina teaching foundation, where we will be talking about the publication of that.</sentence><sentence id="636">So that was my great, great project of translating, of course, volunteering, and what happened is -- and I'm rambling, even though I thought that I would be doing more legal work of some sort after I gra -- after I graduate -- after I retire from the government, I discovered that practice of law is so bureaucratically impeded by various bar associations and I need to join and I need to | -- be licensed that -- that I na -- just naturally evolved that I am a translator today.</sentence><sentence id="637">In the meantime, I picked up</sentence></p><p><sentence id="640">Interview with Wallace Witkowski u September 1, 1998 other pe-people and other projects that I acted as a translator or an interpreter.</sentence><sentence

the organiza -- or- organizing the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> took place, I was, as you can tell from the interview in 1990 -- first of all, I donated a number of books and pamphlets and materials to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, because when I was handling the American claims for property lost in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, when I was working for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, and when I was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>, I managed to reach the people, the survivors who</sentence><sentence id="654">Interview with Wallace Witkowski 8 September 1, 1998 are running the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Historical Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.233028" long="21.017">Warsaw</span>.</sentence><sentence id="655">And I obtained from them a number of unique publications, such as witness accounts of liquidation of ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="50.293009" long="19.162475">Sosnowiec</span> or of some other -- Bialystok, rather obscure publications, of which there weren't very many, you know, issues available.</sentence><sentence id="656">You couldn't find it in a <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="657">But I brought all of these things with me.</sentence><sentence id="658">And when the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> opened, I thought I would donate all of these things to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and that's how my cooperation with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> started.</sentence><sentence id="659">I turned over all of those <span class="NPIP">things</span>.</sentence><sentence id="660">There weren't very many, 10 - 20 books maybe, pamphlets, but they are today in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span>.</sentence><sentence id="661">And then I think you then come in and you have read my interview in 1990, so you know where I felt that I needed to testify as a witness to what I knew from a unique perspective of being this boy scout troop leader who had a boy in my troop who told me the story about his brother being lost and then militia taking him, communist militia taking him to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which the Jewish survivors lived and saying to the little boy, it -- is -- were you kept here?</sentence><sentence id="662">And the kid said yes.</sentence><sentence id="663">That's -- that's the version that I received from my -- from my member of my troop.</sentence><sentence id="664">So I felt duty bound to give testimony to the truth as I know it.</sentence><sentence id="665">So that's how the interview came about.</sentence><sentence id="666">And then I realized that I can be of help in the oral department.</sentence><sentence id="667">And I no longer remember -- but I know that I submitted my offer to -- to translate.</sentence><sentence id="668">That was lost somewhere and somebody -- on somebody's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> for a year, then I --</sentence><sentence id="670">nothing was done about it.</sentence><sentence id="671">One day I enquired, aren't you interested in somebody who knows both languages and can translate?</sentence><sentence id="672">Yes, yes, submit an application.</sentence><sentence id="673">Well, okay.</sentence><sentence id="674">I don't know what happened to -- finally I -- I was put in touch with the oral history department and was asked to help them in translating more significant key testimony of witnesses who were testifying in Polish.</sentence><sentence id="675">And over the last two, three years, I lose track of it because these were long translations, long projects.</sentence><sentence id="676">I worked on the Mordowicz translation, which is an incredible story of a man who twice escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and lived to

Druzhinikov(ph), and also lived -- and what was particularly moving about it was the fact that she admits in the course of the interview that in crucial moments in her life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was her Jewish girlfriends who saved her life.</sentence><sentence id="678">That was a very wrenching job to do.</sentence><sentence id="679">It was a type of work that I could work on, and then I had to go away from it for days sometimes, sometimes a couple weeks before I could return to it.</sentence><sentence id="680">It was just too devastating to relive with this person, what she had to say.</sentence><sentence id="681">I'm delaying giving you the name because I -- I have a mental

class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="682">Why, the most difficult</sentence><sentence id="684">Interview with Wallace Witkowski *deg September 1, 1998 question to answer.</sentence><sentence id="685">Because you see, more than 50 years may have passed since those years of Nazi occupation in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span>, but the events and the feelings stay with us and somehow I feel that this is my way of doing something, because then I was not able to do anything.</sentence><sentence id="686">And secondly, on a deeper level, it is my feeling that in some way I am engaged in some act of expiation or -- or contrition on behalf of my countrymen, for things that they did, or failed to do when they could have.</sentence><sentence id="687">Now, I do not minimize the mutual accusations between the Christian Poles and the Jewish Poles against each other.</sentence><sentence id="688">Anti-Semitism certainly was and is alive, unfortunately, which is a curious phenomenon because there are no more Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and yet, something in -- something has caught both groups in -- in -- in this vicious circle.</sentence><sentence id="689">Now there is a controversy about Poles putting up Christian crosses in -- in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in which both Poles and Jews died, and Jewish tradition, of course, requires that nothing be done there [indecipherable].</sentence><sentence id="690">And -- and there are radicals in both groups that foment discord.</sentence><sentence id="691">So I-- somehow I -- I just feel that whatever I can do to just assist the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in its mission, I'II do it.</sentence><sentence id="692">And even though I am now in the process of moving to <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> and I will be spending most of my time in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span>, I will be connected by modern technology with <span

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="748">A: Well, it's been asked of me a -- a number of times previously, including some video interviews.</sentence><sentence id="749">This ties in very deeply with my spiritual values.</sentence><sentence id="750">I think -- think that not only the mission of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, of teaching people that intolerance, prejudice, discrimination, all these ugly phenomena that characterize our life on earth, have to be eradicated, eliminated.</sentence><sentence id="751">But we have to, ever so slowly, try to awaken to the fact that we are all members of oneness, we are all children of God, we are all brothers, we are all oneness, and as long as we continue looking at other people as separate and distinct from a -- from us, we -- we are not going to find our way back to our creator.</sentence><sentence id="752">And I am a firm believer in that.</sentence><sentence id="753">And I, in this sense too, I see my work for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> as -- as possibly indirectly contributing.</sentence><sentence id="754">Iam extremely impressed with the skill and enthusiasm and -- and -- and -- and energy with which the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was created, is being supported, is being developed and continues its work.</sentence><sentence id="755">And I want to be a part of it, but I also want to be a part of the general effort to teach all of us, and the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is doing its share, showing other, equally egregious holoca -- Holocaust-like experiences of other ethnic groups, be</sentence><sentence id="757">Interview with Wallace Witkowski % September 1, 1998 they Armenians or -- or just because some <span class="REGION">county</span> is in <span class="REGION">Asia</span>, that should not matter less than a mil -- million people were killed because they were Asian rather than they were other group, religious or ethnic.</sentence><sentence id="758">So I guess this is the best I can articulate at this point, why I committed to -- to -- to work for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="773">A: I only have concern that a lot of what I said is not going to be of -- really of -- of -- well, maybe it will be of peripheral value, peripheral value to you to -- to -- to see what kind of people volunteer.</sentence><sentence id="774">But I think the -- that -- that I volunteer for a slightly different reason than let's say a -- a typical, if I may use that word, survivor volunteer works for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="775">There is a deep, tragic, desperate effort to make sure that the people who died, didn't die in vain, without any -- any lessons to be learned from it.</sentence><sentence id="776">So I can -- I respect my -- I-- I--I--I am in awe of these people who come and travel a long distance sometimes, to spend a couple hours in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>, just being escorts, or -- or guides.</sentence><sentence id="777">My commitment is the same and yet somewhat different, because even though all the men in my family died as a result of the war, except my father, who survived the war, but I had uncles.</sentence><sentence id="778">One, a pilot who died in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span>, another persecuted and -- and killed by the communists, I feel that I have the need to assist in preserving the story of the Holocaust and teaching.</sentence><sentence id="779">In one of the interviews I said six million or seven million died, and they're silenced, so</sentence><sentence id="781">Interview with Wallace Witkowski %8 September 1, 1998 somebody has to speak in their <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="782">Even if I am just translating little pieces of the -- of the story, I--I hope that I am making a contribution.</sentence><sentence id="783">And I'm waiting for them to give me more while my brain is still functioning.</sentence><sentence id="784">After all, I am 70.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="803">A: No, I cannot think of anything.</sentence><sentence id="804">The difficult part of it is that even though that interview in 1990 was a two videocassettes long, I can still not -- I still cannot make myself look at it.</sentence><sentence id="805">Like I probably will not be able to listen to this interview that you're conducting with me today.</sentence><sentence id="806">It is helping me in a sense that somehow I unburden myself, that I -- that I lessen the weight of memory by talking about it, but I don't want to review it.</sentence><sentence id="807">No, I cannot think of anything else that I would like to add.</sentence></p></dialogue>
