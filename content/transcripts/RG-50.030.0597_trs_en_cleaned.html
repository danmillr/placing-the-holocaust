they had a married son, two or three kids; and a married daughter with some children.</sentence><sentence id="1617">And then the youngest daughter was, like, in her 20s.</sentence><sentence id="1618">And she was -- I didn't even know at the time she was expecting her first baby.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1619">But it wasn't hardly to see.</sentence><sentence id="1620">And at that time I didn't even know where the babies came from.</sentence><sentence id="1621">Now, I do.</sentence><sentence id="1622">Anyhow.</sentence><sentence id="1623">So -- so on the weekend I met them and

Yiddish to me.</sentence><sentence id="1639">I understood but I didn't speak it that good.</sentence><sentence id="1640">But it's very similar to German.</sentence><sentence id="1641">So I knew what they were saying.</sentence><sentence id="1642">So she introduced me to everybody and she showed me what to do.</sentence><sentence id="1643">How to use this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> and this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1644">A few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> she taught me at my age, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1645">I never worked.</sentence></p><p><sentence id="1646">I had to sew the buttons with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1647">And if you don't put it exactly in and the

get it the right way.</sentence><sentence id="1650">And she was so fast because she's been used to it, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1651">And then there was another machine that made the hems and another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span> for the <span class="DLF">buttonholes</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1652">I had to work all three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span>, and make

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1657">And then I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the evening.</sentence><sentence id="1658">And before I had dinner she used to say to me -- there was only her and her husband living there -- she said, while the dinner is -- while you're waiting you can wash this <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1659">She made me do the housework before -- after a whole day in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1660">Well, anyhow -- but then this was going on for quite a few months.</sentence><sentence id="1661">September came around.</sentence><sentence id="1662">I forgot about it <span class="BUILDING">school</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1663">You know, and nobody mentioned a word.</sentence><sentence id="1664">And I was just working, working every day.</sentence><sentence id="1665">But then she was getting ready to have her baby.</sentence><sentence id="1666">And her name was Fannie.</sentence><sentence id="1667">And so she says, well -- when she couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">work</span> anymore I was on my own.</sentence><sentence id="1668">And then all the work what the two of us did I had to do myself.</sentence><sentence id="1669">So instead of going at nine o'clock in the morning I had to go eight o'clock and seven o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="1670">And instead of staying until five or six, I used to stay until seven, eight o'clock.</sentence><sentence id="1671">Five days, six days, seven days a week, I couldn't keep up.</sentence><sentence id="1672">And I don't know what happened.</sentence><sentence id="1673">One day I remember I was going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and the <span

before 7:30 in the morning you get a return ticket.</sentence><sentence id="1678">So if you give them tuppence and a half, Ha'penny, you get a ticket to go back at night.</sentence><sentence id="1679">So she says,</sentence><sentence id="1681">make sure you get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> before 7:30.</sentence><sentence id="1682">And she gave me tuppence and a half, the Ha'penny.</sentence><sentence id="1683">And that's all the money I had.</sentence><sentence id="1684">I never had pocket money or wages or anything, only food and sleep, <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1685">So I tried to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> -- every time I came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>, there was a <span class="DLF">line</span> from here to God knows where.</sentence><sentence id="1686">All these big guys waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1687">They probably had families to support.</sentence><sentence id="1688">They saw me, they said, that kid's probably working for pocket money and they used to push me on the side and get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1689">And I tried to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> but I couldn't push those guys away.</sentence><sentence id="1690">I was trying to get very hard.</sentence><sentence id="1691">If I was lucky I got on it and I had my ticket to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1692">But I remember one day I tried so hard and they pushed me on the side.</sentence><sentence id="1693">And -- there be another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> in a minute.</sentence><sentence id="1694">Half a minute later the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> came, no more return.</sentence><sentence id="1695">What I'm going to do?</sentence><sentence id="1696">I had to give them the tuppence and I had a Ha'penny left.</sentence><sentence id="1697">I came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I was crying.</sentence><sentence id="1698">So the woman that was working, the one woman, she says to me, what's the matter, Puppala?</sentence><sentence id="1699">Puppala means little doll.</sentence><sentence id="1700">Why are you crying?</sentence><sentence id="1701">So I said, I missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">return bus</span> this morning.</sentence><sentence id="1702">So she said, big deal.</sentence><sentence id="1703">So you're five minutes late?</sentence><sentence id="1704">I said, no, no, no, no, no.</sentence><sentence id="1705">It's not I'm late, I have no money to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1706">She said, what it is tuppence?</sentence><sentence id="1707">Big deal.</sentence><sentence id="1708">Here's tuppence.</sentence><sentence id="1709">And I made a Ha'penny that day.</sentence><sentence id="1710">That's the first money I ever had of my own.</sentence><sentence id="1711">Isn't that something?</sentence><sentence id="1712">I cried because I didn't make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">return
