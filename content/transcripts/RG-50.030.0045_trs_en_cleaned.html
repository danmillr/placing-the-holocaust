<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="51">Q: Right.</sentence><sentence id="52">Uh, tell me about when you uh, what were the circumstances in which you were taken <span class="NPIP">overseas</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="91">Q: Was the fighting very heavy at that point?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="93">A: Uh, well, we had a lot of pockets of resistance.</sentence><sentence id="94">The German people, the Volksturm and the SS would drive the local farmers into shooting at us.</sentence><sentence id="95">If they didn't shoot at us, they would shoot the farmer.</sentence><sentence id="96">And they made feeble attempts at trying to shoot us naturally and the SS, uh, troops kept moving back in towards the interior of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and, uh, the, well, you know, this went on a couple of months.</sentence><sentence id="97">I'm trying to talk here in a few minutes and describe, uh, uh, a couple of months of activity--it's very difficult.</sentence><sentence id="98">The, uh, thing that I remember was we started to see our men being killed and because of our men being killed, a couple here and a couple there, we would kill whole squads of Germans the way they mowed down the, uh, prisoners and, uh, their opponents.</sentence><sentence id="99">And sometimes the <span class="DLF">hillsides</span> would be covered with bodies of the Americans, or a <span class="DLF">hillside</span> would be covered with the bodies of the Germans, and then later on when they were trying to march the political prisoners that were in, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> inmates or, uh, slaves on <span class="DLF">farms</span>, they would, uh, march them ahead of them trying to get them out of our way so we wouldn't see what we they had done to these people apparently.</sentence><sentence id="100">Anduh....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="109">Q: Did you see any of this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="111">A: Yes.</sentence><sentence id="112">These bodies were lying along the <span class="DLF">roadsides</span> where they'd fallen in exhaustion or they were shot because they weren't going fast enough and, uh, it was a terrible thing but, uh, it was practically a common occurrence in the last days of the war.</sentence><sentence id="113">From April 15th to the end of the war we saw this in many <span class="NPIP">places</span> and, uh, uh, the, uh....</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="117">Q: Was that your first contact with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="119">A: Was, was in April, about the 15th of April, yeah, we started to see the where they had been marched ahead of us because, uh, in because of the nature of the spear-heading, the 11th Armored was a part of Patton's 3rd Army which you see here on my cap, this is the 11th Armored Division, and I was in the 56th Engineers, and that's this little insignia right here which is our uniform insignia.</sentence><sentence id="120">And the 11th Armored patch was ordinarily worn on your shoulder and, uh, there there were several armored divisions.</sentence><sentence id="121">We were one of them.</sentence><sentence id="122">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">4th Armored</span> was a sister division, and we were leap-frogging ahead, uh, in spurts as it were until and then we'd rest for a day or two until the infantry caught up to, to, uh, contain the <span class="REGION">lands</span> that we had just over-run.</sentence><sentence id="123">And that's when we would see these prisoners who had been walking ahead of us for a couple of days.</sentence><sentence id="124">We'd catch up to them and we'd see the ones who had been, uh, uh, had died along the <span class="DLF">roadsides</span>.</sentence><sentence id="125">And by the hundreds in some cases, and then just here and there and then they tried to bury some and they were, made half-hearted attempts because they took too much time to bury them.</sentence><sentence id="126">They were trying to hide the, the ones that had died and then there were so many of them they just left them after a while.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="135">Q: All right, tell me if you would where you were as you were about to approach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="137">How did you get there?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="138">A: Well, uh, we were in a combat command.</sentence><sentence id="139">And Combat Command A is the one I was in ordinarily.</sentence><sentence id="140">Uh, we were down in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="141">We were, we forked out.</sentence><sentence id="142">A combat command, one would go to the left, one would go to the right and sometimes a third combat command called "CCR," or "Reserve," would take a central point.</sentence><sentence id="143">And there would be three prongs of us armored, uh, divisions spanning out and covering as much <span class="REGION">territory</span> as we could; and taking it in and and opposing and and mowing down the opposition with our heavy guns, our 75, uh, millimeter guns and three-inch guns on, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank destroyers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="144">And, uh, we kept going and going and until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="145">That was CCA, but CCB went, uh, to the north ofus...</sentence></p></dialogue>

weren't even out working anymore.</sentence><sentence id="609">They were just kept in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they'd feed them with a few crusts of bread and it was a real mess.</sentence><sentence id="610">Everything was smelly.</sentence><sentence id="611">There were no latrine facilities and, uh, they were doing it out in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in you know their bowel movements and so on--such as they had, which wasn't very much.</sentence><sentence id="612">And I was a medic and I was amazed at having been in, having taught first aid before I went in the Army and being a medic at times in the Army on maneuvers, I was a medical aide, corpsman we called them.</sentence><sentence id="613">Uh, I was quite stricken, uh, stricken I should say by the fact that the genitals, or genitalia of the men and the women were the last things to apparently go because they looked normal.</sentence><sentence id="614">The women's breasts had 2 shrunk quite a bit, but their nipples and, uh, and looked normal.</sentence><sentence id="615">And the men's penises and testicles were about normal.</sentence><sentence id="616">And the rest of them were absolutely bones and, uh, with skin stretched over them.</sentence><sentence id="617">And that's the one thing that I'll never forget is, is the condition of, of the things that are needed to reproduce life.</sentence><sentence id="618">They're the last things to go, as far as I could see.</sentence><sentence id="619">In other words, Mother Nature was trying to save the reproductive organs.</sentence><sentence id="620">It was the one thing that struck me out of looking at all these thousands of dead whenever we buried them.</sentence><sentence id="621">And as I said, we had these, uh, they couldn't dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> fast enough so we got our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> to dig the <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, push the dirt out and then was a, uh, was a token for the Germans to get shovels and start to shovel the dirt back into the <span class="DLF">trenches</span>.</sentence><sentence id="622">Well we'd have been there for another two weeks burying them if we had to do everything by hand.</sentence><sentence id="623">We did dig a few <span class="DLF">trenches</span> by hand, but we then used the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozers</span> because there were so many.</sentence><sentence id="624">They had them stacked up by the hundreds waiting to be buried.</sentence><sentence id="625">They couldn't dig the <span class="DLF">graves</span> fast enough by hand, so that's why we got the German, uh, civilians in there to, uh, handle them.</sentence><sentence id="626">They put them down in the <span class="DLF">graves</span> and laid them side by side and then they would throw a few shovels of dirt in and I'll never forget as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span>, as Al pushed the, uh, stone and sand back into the <span class="DLF">trenches</span>, you would hear a stone crunching the ribs and the bones of the poor bodies down below.</sentence><sentence id="627">It was, because this was backfill for the <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> was made out of backfill and from the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and there were a lot of hard stones mixed in and when they pushed the stones in they further crushed the poor things that were laid to rest in that, uh, <span class="REGION">area</span>.</sentence><sentence id="628">After the war they said that they moved the bodies to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper camp</span>--see this was down at the lower level, the <span class="DLF">sports field</span>.</sentence><sentence id="629">Then there was another lower level down around on the quarry level and, uh, there's now a third <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> up on the top where the, uh, the old <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> used to be for the experimental prisoners in the upper part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span></sentence><sentence id="630">The <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> is gone now that was in between, the electrified fences are long gone and shortly after we got most of the people into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">medical tents</span> away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> even.</sentence><sentence id="631">We moved them out into <span class="BUILDING">field hospitals</span>; we burned the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> down because they were that smelly and filthy from all the you know unclean--there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span>, no la...no facilities for latrines.</sentence><sentence id="632">They had these <span class="DLF">ditches</span> in the <span class="DLF">streets</span>, and when the rains came, it would wash everything down the hillside.</sentence><sentence id="633">So all that's gone now and it's, it's a <span class="DLF">graveyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="634">They said they moved the bodies from that <span class="DLF">sports field</span> or <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> but when I went back in 1975 the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> had grown over it already in 35 years.</sentence><sentence id="635">I went there 35 years later and, uh, the, it was so changed.</sentence><sentence id="636">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> now.</sentence><sentence id="637">Where we had seen all these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there were only; they left three of, uh, in the first row, I think there were three, no four left which were now made a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span>.</sentence><sentence id="638">They showed, they had those on exhibit.</sentence><sentence id="639">But the huge <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> down below--they had six hundred to eight hundred people in them were all gone, used up for other purposes.</sentence><sentence id="640">But we did burn most of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the <span class="REGION">upper part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="641">We left a few in the front which apparently were the cleanest.</sentence><sentence id="642">And, uh, we went back in 1975 and the Austrian civilians had a dinner for us.</sentence><sentence id="643">They provided us with, uh, a chauffeur and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">limousine</span> and they, uh, it was unbelievable how they treated us.</sentence><sentence id="644">We were like heroes.</sentence><sentence id="645">And the people, when we went back were hugging us again and trying to touch us and they were grabbing souvenirs and we were giving out little buttons like I have here from my various

this, uh, in 1990 for the 40th Anniversary, 45th Anniversary and, uh, he's bringing 3 some of these along to give to the people for souvenirs.</sentence><sentence id="649">But, uh, we were back again in 1980 and we're trying to go back every five years, and we meet the people that we released, and we meet their children, and now we're bringing our children and it's a great thing that the survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="48.257331" long="14.50012">Mauthausen</span>, and there were around 12,000 alive when we got there.</sentence><sentence id="650">And I guess maybe un another

there and you wouldn't know how they got there because every <span class="DLF">road</span> was full of these big, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tourists bus</span> that hold fifty people--they were lined up like, uh, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> around a <span class="BUILDING">football stadium</span> in the States.</sentence><sentence id="653">Incredible where they come from <span
