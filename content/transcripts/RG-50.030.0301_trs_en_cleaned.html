<body><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1">Q: Can you tell us what your full name was at birth, if it's different, and where and when you were born?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2">A: Well, I was born on the 7th of December 1913 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geteborg</span> on the west coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="4">Q: And your name was Per Anger then?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="6">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="7">Per Anger, I got other names, which I had never mentioned, because that was my mother wanted that I should have named after our old relatives.</sentence><sentence id="8">So my name is Per Johann Valentine (ph).I never mentioned those other names because I don't think they are very pretty.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="13">Q: Do you ever use them?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="15">A: No, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="17">Q: Mr. Anger, in 1941, you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="18">You were a member of the foreign service at this point.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="21">A: 1940.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="23">Q: 1940.</sentence><sentence id="24">Can you tell us what that was like?</sentence><sentence id="25">You were a very young man.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="29">A: This was my first post.</sentence><sentence id="30">I had applied -- see, I had applied for the foreign service already earlier, but I wasn't ready with my exam.</sentence><sentence id="31">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uppsala</span>, I studied law, and in the meantime I was drafted; I was in the military service.</sentence><sentence id="32">So I had difficulty in finishing this, but I just finished in time in December 1939, when the war broke out between <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> and the Soviets at that time.</sentence><sentence id="33">A dramatic period.</sentence><sentence id="34">And the war had already started.</sentence><sentence id="35">And the beginning of World War II had already started, of course.</sentence><sentence id="36">So the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Foreign Office</span> knowing that I was applying for entering the service, they said, "Look, here.</sentence><sentence id="37">We have -- we need staff now.</sentence><sentence id="38">So we could present you as a trainee to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> in January."</sentence><sentence id="39">And so I just got out of the military service, and I just happened to finish my law exam.</sentence><sentence id="40">So I was sent in January 1940 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to help at the commercial department in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="41">So I was working there the whole spring and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then in June, the same year, to apply and to go through the exam for the foreign service.</sentence><sentence id="42">And I managed to get through that and returned then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> where I stayed on till summer "41.</sentence><sentence id="43">And I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> exactly the</sentence><sentence id="45">day when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded, so in June, midsummer "41.</sentence><sentence id="46">So from there on, I stayed on another year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>.</sentence><sentence id="47">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, it was, of course, for me, for a Swede never having been out in war and all that, it was quite a new situation, all that.</sentence><sentence id="48">And it wasn't so much all of the bombing and fighting, that didn't happen then because all over Europe was then slowly being dominated by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="49">Not during the spring, but as you remember, in April they invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in a big operation when they took over all of Europe.</sentence><sentence id="50">So during this first half-year when I was there, it was very, very little of wars, things which reminds me of the war.</sentence><sentence id="51">There were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British airplanes</span> coming in now and then and dropped some bombs on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="52">And so we had to go around in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="53">But it was, of course, hard to get food and it was also a very severe winter that 1940 and so on.</sentence><sentence id="54">So it was in a way then kind of a hardship for all the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>, all of them.</sentence><sentence id="55">But it was not destroyed and not -- those bombs didn't cause very much damage really.</sentence><sentence id="56">But it was a psychological thing, which is very interesting.</sentence><sentence id="57">There came one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British airplane</span> in during the night, say, at midnight and forced the whole population down in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="58">And then Hitler was, of course, furious that the Air Force couldn't stop these people coming in.</sentence><sentence id="59">And so everybody was sitting there in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="60">And then after an hour, they went up again to continue to sleep.</sentence><sentence id="61">And then after two more hours, another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> came from <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and started to drop some bombs and forced the whole population again down in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span>.</sentence><sentence id="62">So that was a kind of psychological warfare, in a way, which was very frustrating for the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="63">Then they started to know that now something is coming here, and this is only the beginning, which was the fact.</sentence><sentence id="64">But then, you see, slowly the Germans took over, and I was there -- I was there in April when we sent the first -- I think it was end of March, we sent the first dispatch or the code telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> about the German planning.</sentence><sentence id="65">That was very -- I was there sitting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on a Sunday when they telephoned from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="66">Now, you have to come here because you are on duty, and you have to send a code telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, a cipher."</sentence><sentence id="67">So I came there and I remember still that was one of the more dramatic periods of my life at that time.</sentence><sentence id="68">I was waiting for that telegram to come, and my boss said, "Now, in a few minutes you will get the most terrible message you ever have met to send to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>."</sentence><sentence id="69">And that was the information we had got through the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span>, and</sentence><sentence id="71">Kanaris (ph) and those people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who were working against Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="72">And we got through them the whole plan that in a few days, they are going to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> -- we didn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, if they were going to touch <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="73">And that's part of a bigger plan to conquer the whole of Europe, including <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span>, which they never succeeded.</sentence><sentence id="74">But the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="75">So I got that in, and I started to put it into this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mapping machine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="76">It was at that time a very awkward <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machine</span>, a modern thing.</sentence><sentence id="77">And I managed to get it through and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> and mailed that to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, and then I couldn't sleep, of course.</sentence><sentence id="78">My god, perhaps I had made the wrong sort of -- pushed the wrong button or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="79">So what happens -- what could happen now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> is that the Germans will invade <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> tomorrow; and they will not be warned in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because there was a sloppy sort of attache at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> who couldn't cipher, who couldn't send the right telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="80">That will be you can read it in all the history books about this man.</sentence><sentence id="81">It was a nightmare I had.</sentence><sentence id="82">And, of course, they could, and that is the interesting reaction then in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- "We think you have been nervous in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span>.</sentence><sentence id="83">I mean, we can't understand why you sort of exaggerate things like that."</sentence><sentence id="84">And they didn't believe us.</sentence><sentence id="85">And then, not till a couple of days before, I would say five days before the invasion, we send a new cable.</sentence><sentence id="86">And then they understood that now, it's serious.</sentence><sentence id="87">Now, it's serious, but that was rather later.</sentence><sentence id="88">You know, we were not prepared at all to defend our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="89">And Hitler apparently thought that it wasn't necessary to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because he could always do that later on.</sentence><sentence id="90"><span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was always there, and we were delivering iron ore to him.</sentence><sentence id="91">And he was happy with that, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="92">So granted, they conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span>, and the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>.</sentence><sentence id="93">So I was then in that situation.</sentence><sentence id="94">Then, we were in administration, we were sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and didn't know from one day or the other if the Germans were going to include <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> also in the attack towards <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span>.</sentence><sentence id="95">And then I also remember another episode which I very much remember is when the brigade or the army, whatever you call it, returned from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> and how the people greeted them and throwing flowers towards the soldiers and thinking that now, the war is over.</sentence><sentence id="96">And the war had just started, you know, which they couldn't understand that.</sentence><sentence id="97">The war had just started.</sentence><sentence id="98">And they marched, these troops marched up and lined up outside the big <span class="BUILDING">palace</span>.</sentence><sentence id="99">The</sentence><sentence id="101">Villa Platt (ph) was the name, and out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> came Hitler.</sentence><sentence id="102">And he was greeted then by the masses saying "Heil, Hitler" and all of that.</sentence><sentence id="103">I was standing there and everybody did this, that salute, so I thought I better do that.</sentence><sentence id="104">Otherwise, I don't -- but I had forgotten one thing.</sentence><sentence id="105">I had still my hat on, and then a man right behind me gave me a blow like that so my hat flew away, I don't how long, because you shouldn't stand facing the Fihrer with a hat on.</sentence><sentence id="106">So that was that atmosphere, you know, of sort of he had more or less hypnotized the whole population.</sentence><sentence id="107">He was the -- I mean, the savior, the Fiihrer and all that.</sentence><sentence id="108">So that gave me the first impression; I saw how terribly this system had infiltrated in the whole population.</sentence><sentence id="109">And then after that came also the persecutions of the -- the Jewish persecutions and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="110">One didn't notice so much of it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> because they did it in a very clever, secret way.</sentence><sentence id="111">But I remember that I had a housekeeper, a Jewish lady, who came to -- I was a bachelor at the time -- to clean up my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span>.</sentence><sentence id="112">All of a sudden, or one day, she didn't come.</sentence><sentence id="113">She just disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="114">So they disappeared, just like that, and were brought to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="115">Only at that time, it wasn't very much known in the world, I would say.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="206">Q: Were you getting reports about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then what was happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in terms of the persecution . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="208">A: Ya.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="210">Q: . ..</sentence><sentence id="211">not just the war?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="214">A: Yes, we didn't very much, say, in 1940.</sentence><sentence id="215">We didn't know very about it then -- or "41, I didn't know other than there was discriminations against the Jewish people and so on.</sentence><sentence id="216">But the first real report we sent -- I wasn't there then, I was then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> -- was sent in "42.</sentence><sentence id="217">You see, there was the big conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> in the beginning of "42, when the final solution was decided upon.</sentence><sentence id="218">And then towards the end of that year, the world started to know about it.</sentence><sentence id="219">I know that the Americans knew about it; also, the Swedish.</sentence><sentence id="220">The American government knew about it, the Swedish government and all that; because we had a diplomat at the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin Embassy</span>, a good friend of mine, who on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in, say, October "42 met an SS officer who came up and said, "I have to tell you.</sentence><sentence id="221">I can't stand it any longer."</sentence><sentence id="222">And he told him the whole story about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="223">And that we</sentence><sentence id="225">reported <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in "42.</sentence><sentence id="226">So, for sure, from the autumn of "42, the Swedish government and the Americans got the same report, and the Swiss and all.</sentence><sentence id="227">From that on, most of the governments in the <span class="REGION">western world</span> knew what was going on.</sentence><sentence id="228">I think that is important to say because to -- knowing how little they did, or they did nothing.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="245">Q: Did you know about the euthanasia killings in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="247">A: About the what?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="249">Q: About the euthanasia, when they were doing so-called mercy killings in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, in the <span class="BUILDING">mental hospitals</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="251">A: I didn't know at that time.</sentence><sentence id="252">I think we got to know about that later.</sentence><sentence id="253">I didn't know anything then at that time, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="257">Q: When you said you were in this situation watching the Fiihrer and watching everybody respond to him and you almost raised your hand in a "Heil, Hitler," but, fortunately, you were stopped, what were you thinking?</sentence><sentence id="258">Were you frightened and thought you would have to do it because somebody . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="261">A: Why, they would have killed me.</sentence><sentence id="262">Oh absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="263">There saying such -- what do I say -- excited, what you call, hypnotical (sic) situation.</sentence><sentence id="264">They were spellbound.</sentence><sentence id="265">They were spellbound by this man.</sentence><sentence id="266">So if you said anything against him or if you did anything to him, you would have been killed on the spot by the mass of people, by the crowd.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="273">Q: When you met ordinary Germans during this period, did they -- were they hypnotized even outside of that situation when there were crowds?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="275">A: Well, they -- not hypnotized, but they were all indoctrinated in a fantastic way.</sentence><sentence id="276">I mean, this Goebbels must have been absolute, remarkable professional in the way of spreading this information or indoctrinating people.</sentence><sentence id="277">Imagine, at that time there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">television</span>.</sentence><sentence id="278">There was just the spoken word.</sentence><sentence id="279">There was the radio, of course, and the newspapers, but that was enough.</sentence><sentence id="280">I was living at that time at the pension, where I was sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the Germans and old people and how the day after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> were so happy.</sentence><sentence id="281">They said, "Look, aren't you happy?"</sentence><sentence id="282">Looked at me, "Why?" "</sentence><sentence id="283">Because we have saved, we have saved your</sentence><sentence id="285">neighbors from being invaded by the allies, by the British.</sentence><sentence id="286">And now, they are going to be free people, and, of course, under our control.</sentence><sentence id="287">Anyhow, we have saved them from this imperialist sort of western powers."</sentence><sentence id="288">This whole attitude was so all over.</sentence><sentence id="289">There were no exceptions from that theory.</sentence><sentence id="290">And, of course, it was part of it and so forth that they were also perhaps -- even if they thought that it was absolutely the wrong, the right version of it, they were scared to say something against it.</sentence><sentence id="291">Because then they knew what was going to happen.</sentence><sentence id="292">So everybody was -- I mean, even the officials in the foreign service with whom I had to deal, they were all the same.</sentence><sentence id="293">They never doubted.</sentence><sentence id="294">When you came up to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span>, I was dealing with the commercial things, always the same salute. "</sentence><sentence id="295">Heil, Hitler," like that, you know.</sentence><sentence id="296">I never said, "Heil, Hitler."</sentence><sentence id="297">Never in my life.</sentence><sentence id="298">So that was the way of greeting people.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="324">Q: What sort of an impression -- you were a very young person and certainly had not experienced this kind of form of government, this kind of oppression.</sentence><sentence id="325">What effect did this have on you in your mid 20s, late 20s?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="328">A: Well, that's -- of course, it was very strange for me to encounter such a system.</sentence><sentence id="329">Of course, it was, but that is also very dangerous because without knowing if yourself, you get indoctrinated.</sentence><sentence id="330">If you every day hear the same thing in radio, read the same thing in the paper, hearing people speaking about the same thing, about how victorious we are and how we are going to conquer the whole world, and all that and so on, and Hitler is a fantastic man.</sentence><sentence id="331">He has given us jobs and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="332">So I sometimes had the impression that I have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> now for some vacation to breathe, to listen to other opinions than this.</sentence><sentence id="333">I mean, this is remarkable how you can get influenced without knowing it yourself.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="340">Q: Did you see any persecution of anybody?</sentence><sentence id="341">Beatings in the <span class="DLF">street</span> or...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="344">A: No.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="346">Q: Nothing?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="348">A: No, I didn't see anything like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="350">Q: How did it happen that you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> in 1942?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="355">A: Well, it so happened because I was then off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> dealing with the Hungarian affairs in the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> with the commercial matters, and there were delegations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> coming.</sentence><sentence id="356">And we were negotiating with them, and we saw that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is a potential sort of delivery of our goods we need.</sentence><sentence id="357">Foodstuffs, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="358"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was and still is an agricultural country, you know, so then they wanted to send someone who already got some experience in these negotiations.</sentence><sentence id="359">So I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> mainly because they needed someone for this job.</sentence><sentence id="360">So I was participating in the negotiations there.</sentence><sentence id="361">The Swedish delegation coming out, I was a member of that.</sentence><sentence id="362">And we tried to -- you know, that old system of negotiations about trade that if we give you some steel, you give us some apples.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="928">A: Well, he was the -- like I said from the beginning, the cultural attache because he was teaching Swedish at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and all that.</sentence><sentence id="929">So we appointed him cultural attache at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, and he was a very good man.</sentence><sentence id="930">Had a fantastic feeling for his fellowman and a great idealist and so on.</sentence><sentence id="931">He - - I would say that he was the man who pushed us very much to do something, because he knew, he knew much more than we did about the Hungarian situation.</sentence><sentence id="932">He had lived there for all the years, so he had a feeling more than we what was coming on.</sentence><sentence id="933">So he insisted very much from the very beginning that, of course, this is good what we are doing here, but we need more staff.</sentence><sentence id="934">We need more help.</sentence><sentence id="935">And why don't we ask Count Bernadotte (ph) to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> with a Red Cross delegation to try to do something?</sentence><sentence id="936">Now, that failed because Bernadotte (ph) never got visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>.</sentence><sentence id="937">The Germans refused to have a relative of the Swedish monarchy on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> there.</sentence><sentence id="938">They couldn't see that, so that never happened.</sentence><sentence id="939">But we raised the question in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> that we need more staff.</sentence><sentence id="940">And that's how -- and not only for that purpose, but also for safeguarding the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>!</sentence><sentence id="941">interests, you see.</sentence><sentence id="942">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- well, I don't know did you say tell this chronological order or not, but Wallenberg comes first.</sentence><sentence id="943">And then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in August with my wife and our baby, left them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to get staff, more staff for taking care of these other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>" interests, you see.</sentence><sentence id="944">So this little <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of five people grew to quite an enormous organization.</sentence><sentence id="945">We had the ambassador who was very loyal to this action and very -- I mean, for us it</sentence><sentence id="947">8 was a great thing, and for Wallenberg also, of course, that he was staying on.</sentence><sentence id="948">It gave our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> a prestige which the others didn't have.</sentence><sentence id="949">The Swiss Ambassador, when it started to -- the bombs started to fall, he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>.</sentence><sentence id="950">The Portuguese left; the Spanish Ambassador left; all of them left.</sentence><sentence id="951">So the only one remaining was -- of course, the Vatican representative, he was there and our ambassador.</sentence><sentence id="952">So we could always -- we always had this base of a strong <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> with an ambassador and all that, which guaranteed legality of our existence and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="953">So that was how our situation was.</sentence><sentence id="954">And then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to get all these people for the special section for the foreign interests.</sentence><sentence id="955">So we had the original <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, where I was sitting in the middle as a coordinator, more or less, to start with, to coordinate the enormous department _ established.</sentence><sentence id="956">The Red Cross, which Langley was basing, was leading, we had the Save the Children, a lady called Asta Nielsen (ph), she was also in the Red Cross in a way or Save the Children Fund.</sentence><sentence id="957">That was the three, we had this big department for the foreign interests.</sentence><sentence id="958">We had one special section for buying all the foodstuffs and all that on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where we had all the people hiding and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="959">So this became really quite a big organization.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="993">Q: Tell me one thing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langley</span>.</sentence><sentence id="994">Did this happen prior to the arrival of Raoul Wallenberg?</sentence><sentence id="995">Did he put signs on <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that said, "Under the protection of the Swedish Red Cross"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="999">A: Uh-huh, ya.</sentence><sentence id="1000">He was very well-meaning.</sentence><sentence id="1001">He tried to help, and the problem with him was, of course, that he wasn't that well organized, so as soon one come and asked for help, he said, "Oh, here, you have a passport or Red Cross," and so on, and he took under his protection <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and all that and put on the sign "This is under protection of the Swedish Red Cross."</sentence><sentence id="1002">And, you see, this became kind of inflation of those papers, and so it became difficult for him in the long run to defend all these.</sentence><sentence id="1003">So this was a headache for us very often to rush out when the Nazis invaded one of his <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span>, for us to rush out and try to stop these Nazis from doing something like that.</sentence><sentence id="1004">But he helped many, and he saved many people, so he should have all the credit for that.</sentence><sentence id="1005">But the problem was, as I say, that he never knew where to stop.</sentence><sentence id="1006">I mean, there was also discussions I had with Raoul Wallenberg later on, "We can't give protective passports to the whole Budapest population because then they will have no value.</sentence><sentence id="1007">So we have to hide ourselves behind a</sentence><sentence id="1009">9 bureaucracy."</sentence><sentence id="1010">But we were able to show, the Germans could come in and look at our files and see those people had protective passports.</sentence><sentence id="1011">Because this man has a cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1012">This person is married to a Swedish girl.</sentence><sentence id="1013">This man is head of big Swedish -- so those criteria were very important to keep and to have as a kind of a protection against accusations that were going around.</sentence><sentence id="1014">So it was a well organized bureaucracy which helped us.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1158">A: That was his idea.</sentence><sentence id="1159">That was his idea.</sentence><sentence id="1160">Oh, yes, it was because, you see, there were so

class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>."</sentence><sentence id="1182">This was in August, the end of August, I think.</sentence><sentence id="1183">The beginning of September, perhaps, when the new situation later on comes when after the revolution when the , the Hungarian Nazis take over.</sentence><sentence id="1184">Then, comes the real job, and it's -- you think in terms of nine months when Raoul Wallenberg was there, from July to January, and of those nine months, he used the first month just to organize things.</sentence><sentence id="1185">But the real rescue operations where he also went out to the <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> and all that -- I was very often with him and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1186">It was a concentrated work of three months where he saves all those people.</sentence></p><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1191">Q: Let's talk about this period between July and October just a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="1192">When he came, did he have a formal mission that he announced to you, or was it very clear what he was supposed to do from some papers that you had received before?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1193">A: Well, he had a clear mandate from the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1194">He had negotiated or had already started negotiating in a clever way with the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span>, and got a mandate to operate quite independently, but under, of course, the cover of the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and subordinated, of course, to the ambassador.</sentence><sentence id="1195">And in the case of the ambassadors delegating me under my sort of command in a way, but we were sort of equal and good friends so that was no problem at all.</sentence><sentence id="1196">So the edict was quite clear that he could perform as he thought would be the most useful, most -- the best one to save as many people as possible.</sentence><sentence id="1197">That he used then unconventional methods and all that, that was hard -- I mean, you see, it was in a way very typical situation was this: That I was sitting there at the Oder (ph) Swedish Embassy and everybody was sort of respecting an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1198">I was a diplomat; my boss was a diplomat, all that dramatic status.</sentence><sentence id="1199">Raoul Wallenberg was a businessman, but he was also given diplomatic status, no doubt about that.</sentence><sentence id="1200">So he had the same -- from the international law, from that viewpoint, he had the same status and the same protection as we had, but being more or less a freelance or having his own department and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1201">We closed our eyes very often when he did things which a diplomat never does.</sentence><sentence id="1202">Bribe people, like that, you know, to save people's lives or doing things out of the ordinary and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1203">And we thought that was a good way of organizing the work.</sentence><sentence id="1204">That he goes "Oh, look, here.</sentence><sentence id="1205">With the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> we are not doing that," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1206">And we don't know about anything illegal and so on and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1207">There you come to a question, which I don't know if you would like me to talk about now.</sentence><sentence id="1208">And that is the relationship between <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1209">How on earth, why did they accept this, the Germans?</sentence><sentence id="1210">That's a good question.</sentence><sentence id="1211">Shall we talk about that?</sentence><sentence id="1212">That is, of course, there you have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, in this case, completely under the command of the Germans, but having a puppet government.</sentence><sentence id="1213">The German and Hungarian government who is in charge whom they could handle as they -- I mean, they could decide anything, the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="1214">They could fire the government; they could do anything.</sentence><sentence id="1215">But they let this government act because for the image of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was in a</sentence><sentence id="1217">4 way good to show that we are -- haven't occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to enslave them, to have them.</sentence><sentence id="1218">They are a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>, and they have their old government, and they have all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1219">That is their relationship between the Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="1220">Now, but how could they accept then that the Hungarians went on and made agreements with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> about the Jewish people who they liked to extinguish, to exterminate?</sentence><sentence id="1221">And then comes this situation into the picture that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very anxious, especially towards the end of the war, to have a <span class="DLF">breathing hole</span> up in the north.</sentence><sentence id="1222">Have a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there with whom they could negotiate.</sentence><sentence id="1223">They could have their spies there, of course, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1224">That was -- all the people, both sides, were happy to have <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because they could meet and they could -- sort of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which was not involved in the war.</sentence><sentence id="1225">And some authors, and I'm not quite sure that I share all this opinion entirely and so on, but the fact is that towards the end of the war the Germans tried, even first the underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> tried, those people who were fighting against Hitler tried through our people in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> through the Wallenbergs -- that's the relatives of Raoul -- to get contact with the allies.</sentence><sentence id="1226">Not with the Soviets, but with the others, with the British and the Americans.</sentence><sentence id="1227">Tried to get contact with them through us to say this: That why couldn't we try to make a deal here now, and we will try to do something?</sentence><sentence id="1228">And they tried to kill Hitler, but they didn't manage.</sentence><sentence id="1229">And on the condition that we capitulate the Jew and that we could make a separate agreement with Jew.</sentence><sentence id="1230">And we all -- and then Himmler worked on that.</sentence><sentence id="1231">It's funny, but he also worked on that idea later on when he said to Bernadotte, I think, that we must all now stand up against this Communistic danger.</sentence><sentence id="1232">They are going to invade Europe, and, you know, we all have to fight against the Communist.</sentence><sentence id="1233">And why don't we now -- why don't you help us to make an agreement with the allies that we could stop the war with them and we all join force against the Soviet?</sentence><sentence id="1234">Completely unrealistic idea, of course, because there was 100 percent solidarity between the Americans and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Soviets on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to win the war against the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1235">That was how it was.</sentence><sentence id="1236">In other words, I think that this time then in 1944 when the war was coming closer to an end that they thought perhaps that it's good to have <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1237">You never know, perhaps we could have their help, I don't know, and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1238">And by all means one shouldn't violate the diplomat relations between <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>, and they respected us as</sentence><sentence id="1240">5 diplomats the whole time.</sentence><sentence id="1241">Even Eichmann respected, in a way, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> even if he hated him.</sentence><sentence id="1242">And they tried once to kill him in letting one of the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> drive into Raoul Wallenberg's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span>, but Raoul Wallenberg wasn't there.</sentence><sentence id="1243">And we reported that to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> instructed our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="52.4546411" long="13.3818501">Berlin</span> to protest in the <span class="BUILDING">German Foreign Office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1244">And they did, and the <span class="BUILDING">German Foreign Office</span> got upset and they reprimanded Eichmann and said, "Why on earth do you do things like that?</sentence><sentence id="1245">We have to respect the Swedes, the Swedish immunity, the diplomats and all that."</sentence><sentence id="1246">And then comes this rather funny answer from him.</sentence><sentence id="1247">You can find that now in the files which are all open now.</sentence><sentence id="1248">Then he answered back, he said, "Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help doing this, trying to do this because Raoul Wallenberg used such unconventional methods."</sentence><sentence id="1249">Imagine.</sentence><sentence id="1250">So that explains, partly explains why they accepted Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1251">And they said after all a handful of Jewish people, if they can be saved just for our image towards <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, it's only good they -- perhaps that was what they thought.</sentence><sentence id="1252">And there on one side of this, why, how did <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> manage?</sentence><sentence id="1253">And even I, when I spoke to German officers at the <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span>, opened these <span class="DLF">doors</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="1254">We have Swedish people there and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1255">It's just because of this reason that they wanted to be correct, to say, towards us.</sentence><sentence id="1256">And I had, of course, my connections with the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> was with the ordinary diplomats.</sentence><sentence id="1257">And they helped me sometimes to get visa for some people and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1258">But there was only a few cases, so we had these official connections with them.</sentence><sentence id="1259">And it's interesting then when the whole comes to an end, when all the Germans evacuate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, there was a telephone call from the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> which says, "Could you take over our interests?"</sentence><sentence id="1260">We had already the Soviets and the others and so on, and we got instructions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span>, "By no means, no."</sentence><sentence id="1261">But we made a compromise, so we told the Germans, "Okay, we will take over the keys to your <span class="BUILDING">building</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1262">We'll have that now."</sentence><sentence id="1263">So I went up to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> up on the side where they have the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and met this terrible man, was his name.</sentence><sentence id="1264">He was not only ambassador, but he was the kind of a governor for this whole part -- a German governor for this whole of the world.</sentence><sentence id="1265">And there he was standing very polite and gave me the keys, and that saved us in a way.</sentence><sentence id="1266">Later on, towards the -- that's a long story -- how that saved us towards the Hungarian officers.</sentence><sentence id="1267">Of course, then we got a paper saying that we have now the interests.</sentence><sentence id="1268">We have</sentence><sentence id="1270">6 the interests of the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1271">So when they tried to arrest one of my colleagues, Berg (ph), he managed to escape, thanks to this.</sentence><sentence id="1272">He was -- it's a long story, when they invaded the - - when the Hungarian officers invaded the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> on Christmas Eve 1944, tried to capture us and we managed to escape most of us, except a few.</sentence><sentence id="1273">The ladies, Asta Nielsen (ph) was taken to the -- first, they were going to shoot.</sentence><sentence id="1274">They lined them up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to shoot them, but they didn't do that.</sentence><sentence id="1275">I don't know why.</sentence><sentence id="1276">Then they took them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and there with the help of the International Red Cross we liberated them, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1277">I wasn't at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> at that time, so I was hiding in another <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1278">But Berg's story, Berg was the head of the Department of Foreign Interests, so when he was captured he said, "Well, I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first and pack."</sentence><sentence id="1279">They wanted to take him away, all of us they want to take away to the <span class="REGION">western Hungary</span> to where they were evacuating.</sentence><sentence id="1280">And then he said, "No, I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first."</sentence><sentence id="1281">So they gave him a Nazi man with a machine gun in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to pick up his belongings.</sentence><sentence id="1282">Instead, he went directly up to the <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span>, jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and said, "We have your interests here, the German interests.</sentence><sentence id="1283">And you have to arrest this man."</sentence><sentence id="1284">And the Germans arrested this Hungarian Nazi and then they gave Berg a big paper saying that Mr. Berg from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> was taking care of the German interests.</sentence><sentence id="1285">He's under the protection of this close Deutch Reich of the big German power.</sentence><sentence id="1286">And we duplicated that paper and I don't know how many copies.</sentence><sentence id="1287">Each of us had this copy in the pocket and we saved us many times; we showed that to the Hungarian Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="1288">It looks like a fairy tale when you talk about it, but it was the reality at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1387">Q: So in a certain way, the German Nazis were respecting this very strange set of behaviors going on?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1389">A: They were.</sentence><sentence id="1390">What I forgot to tell you was, of course, as far as Raoul Wallenberg was concerned, it was not only the fact that he was a Swedish diplomat, but it was, of course, also his personality, I mean, which helped a lot.</sentence><sentence id="1391">Because he was the kind of -- which I forgot to tell you -- a kind of an actor in a way.</sentence><sentence id="1392">He could change.</sentence><sentence id="1393">Funny, to look at him when we were together, he was sitting, speaking in a soft voice, so he looked more like an intellectual, you know, like a professor.</sentence><sentence id="1394">But when he met the Germans, he yelled and he used the same language as they and in a very sort of</sentence><sentence id="1396">7 aggressive way, and they were very impressed, very impressed.</sentence><sentence id="1397">Not only was he diplomat, but also he speaks our language.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1409">Q: Was that shocking for you?</sentence><sentence id="1410">Was that a behavior that . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1413">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="1414">I tried to do the same thing (laughter).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1417">Q: Let me just go back to something that struck me as somewhat funny.</sentence><sentence id="1418">When you first produced, printed the , you discovered something funny in the coat of arms.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1421">A: Oh, terrible.</sentence><sentence id="1422">We put it in the wrong way.</sentence><sentence id="1423">We put one crown like that and two under it; it should be the other way around, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1424">But nobody thought of it at that time.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1429">Q: So the first 4,500 were all...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1431">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1432">All of them, all of them.</sentence><sentence id="1433">All the provisional passports had that funny emblem with the crowns put in the wrong way.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1437">Q: And nobody noticed?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1439">A: No (laughter).</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1441">Q: During these few months before October, before the Hungarian Nazis come in, before the</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1443">comes in, are you and Wallenberg both organizing the group of people who will be doing all the work, helping?</sentence><sentence id="1444">There's a huge organization that he creates.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1445">A: Ya, ya.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1447">Q: Yes?</sentence><sentence id="1448">About how many people does he bring in?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1451">A: At the start, you mean?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1453">Q: Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1455">A: Well, the first people were those whom I had given these provisional passports or these certificates, that was the base, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="1456">Now, there were perhaps 20 people or whatever to start with, and then it increased because we had given them many more.</sentence><sentence id="1457">But then -- and they organized it.</sentence><sentence id="1458">They were very good organizers, those people.</sentence><sentence id="1459">They were heads of <span class="BUILDING">Swedish companies</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1460">They had great experience in dealing with people and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1461">So they knew how to organize an <span class="BUILDING">office</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1462">So he had lots of <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, though.</sentence><sentence id="1463">One <span class="BUILDING">office</span>, say, for administrating the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1464">One <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for scrutinizing the applicants, the applications for passports and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1465">And one</sentence><sentence id="1467">8 part was for the provision of medicine and organizing the medical help to these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, and one for providing with food stamps and all that and so on and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1468">So towards the end of this operation, I think that he had about 400 people, Jewish volunteers who were all working.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1484">Q: So it's a good bureaucracy.</sentence><sentence id="1485">I mean, that had to be very quickly formed.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1488">A: Oh, yeah.</sentence><sentence id="1489">Oh, absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="1490">Oh, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1494">Q: I'm not sure that most people understand how complicated it might be to administer this.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1496">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="1497">Very, very, very much.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1500">Q: And was he the one who actually administered -- I mean, was overseeing everything or was the people that had volunteered at the top, they were doing it and he was doing very particular kind of things?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1502">A: Well, he did both.</sentence><sentence id="1503">I don't know how he had time for both, but, of course, he had a kernel of people who he relied upon to start with, a handful who is his closest collaborators.</sentence><sentence id="1504">You see on that picture where he sits at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and is surrounded by about six or seven people.</sentence><sentence id="1505">Those were the key people who had different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> under their command, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="1506">So he delegated, of course, very much to them, but he supervised himself everything as much as he could.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1512">Q: Is there any such thing as extraterritoriality?</sentence><sentence id="1513">When you created these safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, is there any international law that really allows for this kind of creation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1516">A: It's very -- it was a big <span class="DLF">bluff</span>, the whole thing.</sentence><sentence id="1517">I mean, how can you -- I mean, you see according to international law, there is different degrees of extraterritoriality.</sentence><sentence id="1518">The 100 percent extraterritoriality is the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1519">They have the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where you are sitting and working and the <span class="BUILDING">ambassador's residence</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1520">Then comes, say, my <span class="BUILDING">residence</span>, sort of second degree, and then you have perhaps some <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for issuing passports.</sentence><sentence id="1521">Another third degree, or whatever it was, but in sort of putting on a label on a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> saying that this is under our protection because, I don't know, we own it or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="1522">We created that ourselves and in all this mess, in all this confusion and with the Germans in a way tolerating it, it worked till the real Nazis, the Hungarians, took over.</sentence><sentence id="1523">Then we had great difficulty in defending our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and which culminated on the day when they invaded the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> itself.</sentence><sentence id="1524">Because that was for us never heard of in history.</sentence><sentence id="1525">I couldn't remember anything</sentence><sentence id="1527">9 when I studied diplomatic history once upon a time that an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> has been invaded by the government's troops in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they were located.</sentence><sentence id="1528">So when we were warned then, Wallenberg and myself, on Christmas -- the day before Christmas Eve that they said, "Now, you have to come with us, evacuate from here."</sentence><sentence id="1529">And was told that the Germans remaining in the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, and they said, "Well, if you don't fall out, you have to take the consequences."</sentence><sentence id="1530">Well, we didn't think very much of it.</sentence><sentence id="1531">Of course, never on earth are they going to attack the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1532">They might attack Raoul Wallenberg's <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>, I don't know.</sentence><sentence id="1533">But our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, which has 100 percent extraterritoriality, they won't, but they did.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="1553">Q: Prior to October, prior to the Hungarian Nazis coming in, do you know whether Raoul Wallenberg was in touch with the underground organizations, with the Jewish Counsel in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="1555">What sort of contacts he was making, was he telling you about this?</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="1556">A: Well, with the Jewish Counsel, we always had contacts, because that was an official institution, as you know, which the Germans had all over the world when they had invaded a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1557">That was for them a very convenient, practical way of dealing with the Jewish question.</sentence><sentence id="1558">To channel it through the Jews themselves which they did then, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1559">They had a Jewish Counsel to whom they always said, "Look here, if you know, be quiet now and tell your people that nothing is going to happen," and so on and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1560">They are just going to move you to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1561">Through these organizations they managed -- they had a very clever way of these deportations, you know.</sentence><sentence id="1562">They got, of course, experienced during the time how to do it.</sentence><sentence id="1563">So they made it, did it step-by-step like that, very often with the help of the Jewish Counsels who were in good faith and thought that this was going to be only moving us to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so on.</sentence><sentence id="1564">And we had contact with them and Raoul Wallenberg.</sentence><sentence id="1565">When he came, he had already a list of people not so much underground, but social democrats people and party people who were against Nazis and all that.</sentence><sentence id="1566">That, he had and so on, but the real contact with the fighting underground, I don't think that he had that from the beginning.</sentence><sentence id="1567">I had it then later on when it was the question about defending our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>.</sentence><sentence id="1568">We foresaw the situation when the Germans who after all were a guarantee for our protection, when they evacuated and an interval until the Russians would come, when the criminals,</sentence><sentence id="1570">0 the Hungarian officers would come over and there would be no rules whatsoever for diplomats, you see.</sentence><sentence id="1571">We foresaw a situation like that, and so I contacted then the underground, and they had promised to put people to our disposal for defending us.</sentence><sentence id="1572">And we ourselves bought weapons on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span>, machine guns, to protect ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="1573">Now, this situation never came about.</sentence><sentence id="1574">They persecuted us and we were hiding, but it never came to fightings between us because when they were starting to persecute us and we were hiding, the Soviets arrived.</sentence><sentence id="1575">So they had no time for this period we had thought was coming.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2043">A: Not every day, but we tried to have a contact to eliminate the risks for the whole staff, for him, for us.</sentence><sentence id="2044">We were never staying, all of us, in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2045">And we were moving very often from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another.</sentence><sentence id="2046">We never -- tried to never spend every night in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span>, so to say.</sentence><sentence id="2047">And there he was, of course, with his knapsack and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bag</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2048">He had a greater advantage to move around in there, I mean in that respect.</sentence><sentence id="2049">So, but we had a kind of communication, so to start with he tried to come over to our <span class="NPIP">part</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2050">And he knew day-by-day where I am going to stay, and I knew where he was going to stay pretty regularly.</sentence><sentence id="2051">And I went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> now and then and so on, and then, as I say and I write in my book, the last time he came was the 10th of January 1945 when he comes up to the Buda side on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2052">And it was a situation where the bombs were falling down all around and all that, and we were going to see a general, an SS general, who was sitting deep under in the <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2053">You know, from the historical time, once upon a time, long ago when the Turks were dominating that part of the world, they had sort of big underground <span class="DLF">caves</span> which were in existence.</sentence><sentence id="2054">So I remember from our small <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> we had in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was staying for a while, you had the connections you could go further down.</sentence><sentence id="2055">There was, for instance, the International Red Cross had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there, and that is the place where tens of thousands Hungarians took refuge.</sentence><sentence id="2056">They went there the day when the Russians were encircling the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, and the final fightings were starting.</sentence><sentence id="2057">And thinking that they were going to sit there a couple of days; they were there three weeks.</sentence><sentence id="2058">You see, you can imagine the situation among those people.</sentence><sentence id="2059">I went down there down then and saw it, without food and everything.</sentence><sentence id="2060">They had some perhaps some water to drink and all that and so on, but most of those people survived after all.</sentence><sentence id="2061">How they looked when they came up to the surface is another question.</sentence><sentence id="2062">So there were all these people underground in those <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> sitting there waiting for the Russians to come.</sentence><sentence id="2063">And there also the Germans had the commandos, so there was an SS general sitting there with his staff.</sentence><sentence id="2064">And Raoul and I went to him because we wanted to have some more -- some guarantees from the Germans that they, after all, should try to help to protect our</sentence><sentence id="2066">0 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, you see, and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2067">That is the situation when this German says to Raoul Wallenberg that "You are our greatest enemy ever, and you are hiding in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> one of the underground fighters, Hungarians.</sentence><sentence id="2068">And how could you do that?"</sentence><sentence id="2069">And then Raoul Wallenberg answers that "I don't do that.</sentence><sentence id="2070">I have never been hiding someone."</sentence><sentence id="2071">His name was Deuschufee (ph).</sentence><sentence id="2072">He was a journalist and he was underground fighter and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2073">I knew him very well, so I said to this general "Well, look here.</sentence><sentence id="2074">I can guarantee that he's not there.</sentence><sentence id="2075">We are never hiding anybody."</sentence><sentence id="2076">And that was our principle, we were never hiding anyone in the real <span class="BUILDING">embassy building</span> or in our private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because we didn't want to risk our own existence, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2077">If they discovered that, we would have been deported ourselves.</sentence><sentence id="2078">I mean, to be able to continue our work, we had to respect those kind of rules.</sentence><sentence id="2079">So the people we were hiding were all in the protective <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2080">And he said, "Well, look, I know better."</sentence><sentence id="2081">And that is the strange story that when I meet this man again, Deuschufee (ph) was his name, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> when I was posted there and he was then in the government, the liberal government for one year after Russians took over, 1946, "47, and he was one member of the government.</sentence><sentence id="2082">So he came to a big conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span>, and we were sitting together one evening, and I told him the story about this absurd story.</sentence><sentence id="2083">And he started to laugh and say, "Well, of course, I was there the whole time, but you didn't know it.</sentence><sentence id="2084">I was hiding in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there which you didn't know about.</sentence><sentence id="2085">I knew this old <span class="BUILDING">house</span>, I knew it very well.</sentence><sentence id="2086">So I was hiding in the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there, and I so very often saw you and Raoul sitting having dinner there over the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2087">But I never told you."</sentence><sentence id="2088">And it's strange then that this German knew it, but he didn't dare to go into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> because it was <span class="BUILDING">Raoul Wallenberg</span>, it was a Swedish diplomat's home.</sentence><sentence id="2089">He never violated that.</sentence><sentence id="2090">That was a typical example of this German sort of -- this correct sort of attitude they tried to maintain with every Swede.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2143">A: Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="2144">Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="2145">So that is when I said to Raoul, "Now, you have really -- now, you have done the job here.</sentence><sentence id="2146">Now, you have to think of your own safety absolutely because the whole situation is completely hopeless as chaotic and all that," and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2147">And that is when he says, "But you see, I can't stop now any longer because I can never return to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> without knowing that I've done as</sentence><sentence id="2149">1 much as I can to save as many people as possible."</sentence><sentence id="2150">That is his last word to me, the 10th of January.</sentence><sentence id="2151">Then he returns to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2152">The Germans withdraw, blew up the <span class="DLF">bridges</span>, and Raoul is arrested by the Soviet troops.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2174">A: Ya.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2176">Q: What did this entail?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2178">A: Well, you see, this also I think contributed to the suspicions, the Russians!</sentence><sentence id="2179">suspicions because he very proudly he told them the story about the future here now will be that I, Swedish diplomat and all that, I am going to stay on and I am going to reorganize this humanitarian action.</sentence><sentence id="2180">I'm going to see to it that the family will be reunited.</sentence><sentence id="2181">That the property is put back to the Jewish people, and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2182">And some author has said that he was politically naive.</sentence><sentence id="2183">And my answer to that is weren't we all very naive, the whole <span class="REGION">western world</span>?</sentence><sentence id="2184">I mean, we accepted the Soviets because they helped to defeat the Nazis.</sentence><sentence id="2185">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, when I told the people that I'm completely convinced that the Soviets had arrested Raoul, that how could you say things like that about the Soviets, our great helper?</sentence><sentence id="2186">They have helped us to defeat the Nazis, the Nazi system and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2187">And the whole <span class="REGION">western world</span> said the same thing till 1948, at least, until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> situation then.</sentence><sentence id="2188">So we all thought -- we thought ourselves as soon as the Soviets arrive, we will reestablish our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> here.</sentence><sentence id="2189">We will continue our work.</sentence><sentence id="2190">Never happened.</sentence><sentence id="2191">They didn't want any foreigners to remain on the <span class="REGION">territory</span> which they were going to occupy.</sentence><sentence id="2192">So all the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> were taken away like that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2208">Q: Let me go back a little bit again.</sentence><sentence id="2209">Between October 15th and December after Christmas when it becomes really impossible to do very much except to save oneself, how is it that you or Wallenberg</sentence><sentence id="2211">2 find out that a particular action is going to happen someplace and that he goes to try and save people?</sentence><sentence id="2212">I mean, how do these messages get transmitted so that you know where to go?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2218">A: Well, you know this big organization he had was, of course, consisted also of younger sort of boys, whatever, and were running between the different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2219">And they had the information from -- we -- I am sure that Raoul Wallenberg had that.</sentence><sentence id="2220">There weren't so many of these <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span>; there were one or two only.</sentence><sentence id="2221">I am convinced that the -- and yes, I know that he had some people there who observed the situation and reported immediately to him.</sentence><sentence id="2222">So that wasn't such -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> isn't that big a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span>, so they could bicycle back to him or whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2223">It wasn't complicated, no.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2230">Q: Were things like this done once a day, more than that when he would go out?</sentence><sentence id="2231">I mean, what kind of situation are we talking about when we talk about not simply saving people by giving them the passes which are obviously very significant, but also going out and doing something, which was what was unusual, when you and he went out or he went out?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2234">A: Well, it was all certainly a combination of all this that he -- first, we had the protective passports.</sentence><sentence id="2235">The people lodged in our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span>, that's one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2236">But once that was done, it was the question to try to save more people than that.</sentence><sentence id="2237">And also to find if by chance some people without a passport had been deported or were on the way to be deported, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2238">So that became a routine in a way to check on that when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or the death marches later on, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2239">So that was complementary to this first more or less organized sanction by the government and all that; that was one thing.</sentence><sentence id="2240">The other thing was to try to -- I had hoped to help people who were on the way to be deported and then comes, of course, the big risky operation which Raoul Wallenberg didn't form himself, but indirectly through his presence.</sentence><sentence id="2241">You see, it's also interesting with Raoul Wallenberg which is very well described by Levi in the first book which appeared just after the war.</sentence><sentence id="2242">He says something like that Raoul Wallenberg became the observing eye, so to say, which -- the conscience.</sentence><sentence id="2243">He became kind of a something which the Nazis feared in a way that his mere presence stopped them from going still further in a way sometimes.</sentence><sentence id="2244">And an example of that is, of course, that when one of the collaborators, I don't think that Raoul Wallenberg was present himself, heard that the Hungarian officers were going to blow up the whole, so to say, international -- our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in</sentence><sentence id="2246">3 their desperation because they couldn't deport any people any longer because, you see, they were just being encircled by the Russians.</sentence><sentence id="2247">Then he took upon him to say in Raoul's words that Raoul Wallenberg is sending a message to you, General Schmitthuber (ph), who was the last remaining army general.</sentence><sentence id="2248">I mean, not SS, but the army general in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>. "</sentence><sentence id="2249">If you don't stop this action which the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian offices</span> are planning, I'll see to it that you will be hanged as a war criminal after the war."</sentence><sentence id="2250">And then the general stopped this action; 70,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span>.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2268">Q: What do you think they were actually intending, machine-gunning people or bombing it or does anyone know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2270">A: Well, there were both, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2271">Putting the fire and then shooting them.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2274">Q: So this was an intermediary who called this general and said this?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2276">A: No, no.</sentence><sentence id="2277">So that -- in Richard Chamberlain's film, they have -- it's more dramatic, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2278">Raoul Wallenberg is running to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schmitthuber</span> (ph) and telling all that.</sentence><sentence id="2279">It never happened, but anyhow it doesn't make a difference because the people were saved thanks to his name.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2284">Q: This is rather extraordinary that one person would have such an impact.</sentence><sentence id="2285">When you knew him as a younger man, would you have been able to predict that he would have such ingenuity and initiative and a kind of fearlessness in such a difficult situation?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2288">A: No, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2289">I think he grew with the task, as we all do, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2290">That he -- I'm not astonished at all that he became that kind of a person.</sentence><sentence id="2291">He -- we all came into a situation where we thought that this is going to be a fowl couple of months and kind of really had a cross section of people we saved and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2292">I don't think that we ever thought of -- first of all, we never thought of the danger we were in.</sentence><sentence id="2293">And the second thing is we never thought of the dimensions -- the enormous dimensions it would take; I mean, the magnitude of this operation.</sentence><sentence id="2294">We were not dreaming of that.</sentence><sentence id="2295">Raoul Wallenberg in a way was forced into an operation which became much bigger than he ever thought of.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2304">Q: Did the other legations -- because other legations ran safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> also -- did they also have such a large staff, do you know?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2309">A: No, they didn't.</sentence><sentence id="2310">They had also Jewish volunteers and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2311">Of course, the Swiss were the next biggest, but the other were the small actions, the Portuguese and the Spanish and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2315">Q: Did you know Gyergyi Polaska (ph) from the <span class="REGION">Spanish sector</span>?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2317">A: Well, I don't know -- well, I heard his name many times now and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2318">And he was the Spanish sort of charge d'affaires, they called him.</sentence><sentence id="2319">He called himself an ambassador, I think.</sentence><sentence id="2320">Like Hungarian Count Pongras (ph), whom I knew very well, he called himself Ambassador of <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2321">Of course, when those ambassadors left, they gave over everything to locally employed people, which they knew, so they took over.</sentence><sentence id="2322">And it's interesting to see how in the documents which also are produced in Levi's book when we made joint interventions for the government, they were signed by , my boss, by Lutz (ph), or Feller (ph) was my opposite, a young , Count Pongras (ph) and so on, Ambassador of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2323">And so there were always a sort of a joint -- very often joint interventions from the neutral countries.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2331">Q: Can you explain what that means for people who don't know what that means when you say "a joint intervention"?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2333">A: Well, that we all go together.</sentence><sentence id="2334">I mean, that we go together, the four or three or four or five, the neutrals presented -- go together to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> and present a paper signed by all of us that we protest against this action you have taken against whatever, our nationals or against people under our protection and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2337">Q: In those situations, you present a document?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2339">A: Oh, yes.</sentence><sentence id="2340">Oh, yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2343">Q: Is there then a discussion or is it simply a formal presentation and then . . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2345">A: Oh, well, it could be followed by discussions, of course, at the same time.</sentence><sentence id="2346">Yes.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2349">Q: But a very formalized kind of...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2351">A: Well, Raoul Wallenberg was often initiated to this, of course, and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2353">Q: So he sometimes was part of the discussions in the interventions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2355">A: Oh, ya, ya.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2357">Q: And did he act differently than the rest of you in those situations?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2362">A: Beg your pardon?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2364">Q: Did he act differently in those situations or was he acting in a diplomatic fashion in those interventions?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2366">A: No.</sentence><sentence id="2367">Well, it was different depending on the situation, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2368">There was no special -- you can't say there was any special rules for how to act.</sentence><sentence id="2369">You always had to adopt yourself after the situation and improvise and all that.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2374">Q: Talk to me a little bit about neutrality and what that means and what you felt given all that you saw about your government's own neutrality.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2376">A: Well, you see, the neutrality is a concept which has been very much discussed, of course, especially now in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in this completely new situation today.</sentence><sentence id="2377">But neutrality for us during the war was, of course, that we tried not to take sides, not to be in the middle.</sentence><sentence id="2378">A very egotistical sort of policy that you try to save your life, your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2379">That's perhaps quite natural in a way, and so on, but neutrality speaking of the time during the war, of course, if you are smart and you have adapted a little bit, changed it a little bit.</sentence><sentence id="2380">So I think that the Swedish government was very anxious towards the end of the war to be more pro-allied than they were just at the beginning of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2381">And that's no longer, I'm not -- no one should be astonished about that kind of a situation.</sentence><sentence id="2382">So from having had given in for the Germans in the beginning when we didn't know if they were going to invade us or not, it was permitting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with soldiers through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, German soldiers and all that, and delivering iron ore to them and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2383">At the time we diminished all this like that, so towards the end of the war we didn't give the Germans any favor whatever.</sentence><sentence id="2384">We were more favorable towards the allied countries and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2385">And I'm sure that that was also part of our -- well, the political, it was.</sentence><sentence id="2386">Of course, humanitarian.</sentence><sentence id="2387">Of course, this was help for the Jewish people, but I think it was well in <span class="DLF">line</span> with our policy towards the end of the war that we show up.</sentence><sentence id="2388">Look here, what we have done for you.</sentence><sentence id="2389">We have helped the Jewish people, and we have been fighting against the Germans, the Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span>, and all that.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2411">A: Ya, I think so.</sentence><sentence id="2412">And that is very well illustrated by a friend of mine.</sentence><sentence id="2413">His name is Steve Koblik.</sentence><sentence id="2414">Perhaps you have heard about him; he's a historian, Jewish historian at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2415">And he wrote a book, first in Swedish.</sentence><sentence id="2416">He speaks Swedish like a Swede because he's married to Swedish lady.</sentence><sentence id="2417">And it appeared a couple of years later, the same book in English.</sentence><sentence id="2418">It's called "If the Stones Cry Out."</sentence><sentence id="2419">It's from the Bible, that if you are silent -- you can't keep that silent because the stones will cry out, is from Jesus, sort of a chapter in the Bible.</sentence><sentence id="2420">And he wrote that book and that is just about the Swedish situation towards the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> between 1930- something when the Nazis started off in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> till the end of the war.</sentence><sentence id="2421">Where he tells us who doesn't know it -- I knew it, of course -- and the Swiss were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2422">How we had no visa with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2423">The Germans could freely come to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> without visa.</sentence><sentence id="2424">And then the Swiss government and the Swedish government asked the Germans, "But how do we know if there are any Jewish people among those people?" "</sentence><sentence id="2425">Well, we'll see to it that they put a J in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passport</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2426">And those people were stopped at the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, because the Swedish trade unions, the Swedish doctors, one special one person in the Swedish government was anti-Semitic.</sentence><sentence id="2427">They said we -- and the Jewish people themselves and that is terrible.</sentence><sentence id="2428">The Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> said, "Don't let any" -- quoting him now the whole time, as you understand, in his book.</sentence><sentence id="2429">They were saying according to his words that "For God's sake, don't let any Jewish people come into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because there will be a Jewish problem in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>."</sentence><sentence id="2430">You see, that reflects the whole atmosphere in Europe or in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or wherever you are in the world.</sentence><sentence id="2431">I mean, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span>, In <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>, they know pretty well what's going on.</sentence><sentence id="2432">Six million people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2433">And they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> the problem to create the state.</sentence><sentence id="2434">To create the State of Israel, they wanted to be on good terms with the British, and the British were in the dilemma that they didn't want to have too many Jewish people coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because there would be conflict with the Arabs.</sentence><sentence id="2435">This is policy the whole time, the whole time, see, which stopped the possibility of taking in more Jewish people at that time to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2436">So if you ask and I'm quite straightforward to you in this question, because | think that the whole world, the whole world is guilty in this situation.</sentence><sentence id="2437">And how then he describes then how we comes further in this situation.</sentence><sentence id="2440">7 When the war breaks out, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was in a very great danger to be occupied by the Germans.</sentence><sentence id="2441">1942, when we reported that the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> existed and when Roosevelt got the same report in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span>, there was great anti-Semitic feelings here, so there was not published at all anything from the government about these <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2442"><span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, the same thing.</sentence><sentence id="2443">But if I talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, I think we could have sort of brought out this to the public in, say, in 1943, when you could see that the war is not going to be won by the Germans, and after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2444">And as Koblik says in his book, he means that if <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span>, a neutral country, or <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span>, a neutral country, would have published in big headlines what's going on, it would perhaps have given the Germans second thoughts.</sentence><sentence id="2445">That they would have not stopped, but slowed down this whole action.</sentence><sentence id="2446">And above all, he says in his book it would have given the Jewish people an information from neutral <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span>, where they must tell the truth, after all, about this and would perhaps have given the Jewish people a more feeling to resist.</sentence><sentence id="2447">You might take all this what I have told you now, I'm not saying that it's my opinion at all like that, but I think it's very interesting that an American author, an American historian puts forward all these arguments here against the whole world which did nothing to help.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class=""><p></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2519">A: I think that's -- it was the Head of the War Liberty Board who initiated or proposed this.</sentence><sentence id="2520">And not only bombing, above all bombing the <span class="DLF">lines</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>, so he was very active in suggesting this.</sentence><sentence id="2521">The answer was and that is, of course, very much because of the Soviet attitude because the allies were very -- there was a great similarity with the Soviets because they were, after all, helping to -- they were saving British or American lives in putting in so much force themselves.</sentence><sentence id="2522">So if the Russians said no, we are not in war just to protect the Jewish people, we veto that.</sentence><sentence id="2523">And we have no time, we have our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> for other purposes, namely, to kill Germans, and that's not at all for this purpose you suggest, they told them, see.</sentence><sentence id="2524">And I think that's a terrible thing because it wouldn't have cost them more than one or two bombs to throw down on these <span class="DLF">connection lines</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2525">That would have stopped, at least they would have saved hundreds of thousands of people just stopping that deportation.</sentence><sentence id="2526">So that's terrible, but it's very easy also, of course, afterward to sit down there and say you should have done that and you should have done that.</sentence><sentence id="2527">One really has to also try to see it how was the real situation and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2528">So it's very difficult to judge, but from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like this, I think it was a great mistake not at least to bomb the <span class="DLF">connection lines</span> within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2529">I think that would have helped a lot to save many people's lives.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2541">Q: You, in an interview at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uppsala</span>, commented on a question that a filmmaker had asked you that had one of you returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span>, not just Raoul Wallenberg, what do you think would have been the feelings, the understandings of what everybody did?</sentence><sentence id="2542">I think the question has something to do with when one person is taken and other people who have also done many things came back, does that enlarge the reputation of Raoul Wallenberg, because he was the one who obviously suffered after the war in a way that the rest of you didn't.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2545">A: Well, I think that the mere fact that we all stood up behind Raoul Wallenberg, and even if we were not -- every person were not engaged 100 percent like Raoul Wallenberg in saving people like that, at least at the beginning we had so many other things to do, and we were working day and night, especially before he came, of course.</sentence><sentence id="2546">But after he came, for me, the main task was to keep this together.</sentence><sentence id="2547">I mean, it could have easily ended up in a big catastrophe if he made mistakes which would have, after all, frustrated the Germans that much that they would stopped everything, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2550">9 So there was a balance the whole time, and I think because that we had this big organization, because we had an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> with a reputation of being correct and that and having the relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and all that, Raoul Wallenberg with all what he did and so on, he could never have acted on his own alone, never.</sentence><sentence id="2551">So even if he and every person didn't do the same job as he did, the mere fact that he was there, that the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> was there, that was the whole base for his action, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2552">So we both helped each other in one <span class="NPIP">way</span> or another as much as we could.</sentence><sentence id="2553">So, I mean, did the question you asked was -- I don't. . .</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2563">Q: Well, I think what the filmmaker was asking was if all of you had been caught by the Russians, as you were, you then were sent back.</sentence><sentence id="2564">If all of you had been caught and not sent back, would everyone's reputation have been different?</sentence><sentence id="2565">Would there be this -- in other words, there is a way in which people understand the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> as one hero, and that's clearly not how it was.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class=""><p><sentence id="2569">Because alone Raoul Wallenberg could not have possibly have done what he did, right?</sentence><sentence id="2570">So I think his question to you has to do with the reasons why the reputation is so much larger than other people's.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2571">A: Ya.</sentence><sentence id="2572">Well, I think I understand what you mean.</sentence><sentence id="2573">And, of course, suppose that nobody had come back.</sentence><sentence id="2574">Of course, still Raoul Wallenberg would have got most of the credit.</sentence><sentence id="2575">Of course, he did the job more than we did, but I think that we would have been recognized also for being his supporters and the base for his action.</sentence><sentence id="2576">I think especially in the perspective perhaps not the first day after the discovery, but in a perspective now with all historians looking to this, I think they would have today to say that today we would still be there somewhere or killed or died.</sentence><sentence id="2577">Today, they would have analyzed the situation, and they would have come to this conclusion, as I told you.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2585">Q: Were you a balance for him, both as a person and as representing a more -- well, the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> because he was not trained as a diplomat?</sentence><sentence id="2586">He wasn't coming there to be a diplomat.</sentence><sentence id="2587">Was there a way in which you...</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2591">A: Ya, of course, that was part of my job to balance between -- of course, when he came first, the other staff, I mean, the other people in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span>, for them it was a very strange situation.</sentence><sentence id="2592">Here's an outsider coming and he takes over and he acts on his own, and this is being an arms operation</sentence><sentence id="2594">0 and what's going on here?</sentence><sentence id="2595">I remember when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> in August, I'd been <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my wife and all that and came back with some more people, __--_and so on for helping, Asta Nielsen.</sentence><sentence id="2596">Wallenberg had already been in action then for a month when I came.</sentence><sentence id="2597">And the whole <span class="BUILDING">embassy building</span> was filled with Jewish applicants in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and all over, and he was distributing passports to all of the people.</sentence><sentence id="2598">And the staff were upset, and I said, "Now, take it easy, take it easy.</sentence><sentence id="2599">I'll talk to Raoul about this."</sentence><sentence id="2600">And when he heard my arguments, he understood completely what I was aiming at; namely, that if we now established a big rescue operation in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> here along those <span class="DLF">lines</span> you are thinking of, we will not have any possibility to act as an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> any longer with our ordinary work, and we won't be recognized any longer as the Oder (ph) Swedish Embassy.</sentence><sentence id="2601">We will be a big rescue kind of <span class="BUILDING">station</span> here, so, please, now, you have to organize this another way.</sentence><sentence id="2602">And he understood immediately what I was aiming at.</sentence><sentence id="2603">So he had these volunteer people and they established his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the Pest side and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2604">So the whole situation calmed down.</sentence><sentence id="2605">And then after that, the whole staff completely understood the situation and especially when I continued my discussions with Raoul and said, "You have to stick to these criteria the whole time because we have to have vis-a-vis the Germans a correct bureaucracy for what we are doing.</sentence><sentence id="2606">And we can't give away protective passports to anyone like that, at least not now in the beginning when everything is comparatively calm here and we can work in all quiet," and all that and so on.</sentence><sentence id="2607">Which didn't prevent him, of course, towards the end when everything was falling into pieces and all the bombing and all that that he could distribute protective passes to anyone he wanted to help.</sentence><sentence id="2608">That was the next situation when you couldn't lose anything on doing that.</sentence><sentence id="2609">But the whole start, it was absolutely necessary to make that along as <span class="DLF">corrective lines</span> as possible.</sentence><sentence id="2610">As correct as possible.</sentence></p></dialogue>

<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2633">A: Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="2634">Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="2635">Oh, no.</sentence><sentence id="2636">He understood it completely.</sentence><sentence id="2637">So, but that was a part of my diplomatic training, and he being a clever businessman making business and all that, you see, in his way of acting.</sentence></p><p></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2641">Q: How did you understand his passion for wanting to come over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> to save Jews?</sentence><sentence id="2642">Did he ever explain what -- it's not the most usual decision to make.</sentence></p></dialogue><dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2643">A: No, I understood it in a way.</sentence><sentence id="2644">I understood it because I knew from years before in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> when we were both young and all that that he always stood up for young people who were badly treated by their comrades and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2645">And in the military service also, we were together there.</sentence><sentence id="2646">He always stood up for weaker people, and he also had this kind of enthusiasm for helping and ideas and inventiveness and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2647">So from that I understood in a way -- understood it, perhaps not 100 percent.</sentence><sentence id="2648">That I understand now much better when I'm reading -- I read the letters between him and his grandfather where you see how his character develops and how he comes here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and he studies at <span class="BUILDING">Michigan University</span> and how he wholeheartedly accepts the American way of life, the freedom, democracy and integrity of man and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2649">And with those impressions, he then comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hillefors</span> where he meets the first Jewish refugees, and I'm absolutely convinced that when he saw this, that they were unheard of stories, that he said to himself, "I have to do something.</sentence><sentence id="2650">Absolutely, I can't be passive.</sentence><sentence id="2651">I have to do something for helping."</sentence><sentence id="2652">And then it so happened that he comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and works with a Jewish businessman there, and he gets the story from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE" lat="47.497778" long="19.039722">Budapest</span> what's happening there and so on and so on.</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Question"><p><sentence id="2663">Q: When you helped Mr. Wall (ph) who came to see you that night, would you say that your -- not appreciation of the problem -- but your decision to help came from him coming to that <span class="DLF">door</span>, and then you -- sort of the <span class="DLF">door</span> would not close anymore in a certain way?</sentence><sentence id="2664">This was not a plan in your head that you were going to go out and save the Jews either?</sentence></p></dialogue>
<dialogue class="Answer"><p><sentence id="2667">A: No, because it came that early, so I hadn't faced the situation really.</sentence><sentence id="2668">But he described it to me, of course, and the following days we saw it.</sentence><sentence id="2669">We saw how they were queuing up <span class="NPIP">outside</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2670">We saw that this is very serious.</sentence><sentence id="2671">Absolutely.</sentence><sentence id="2672">So that's no doubt how you get more and more involved in this, how it grows and all that.</sentence><sentence id="2673">And I was asked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> when I was there in November, we discussed at the symposium or whatever what characterized a humanitarian.</sentence><sentence id="2674">That is really not an easy question to answer, you know.</sentence><sentence id="2675">So I could only exemplify it by telling the story about Raoul Wallenberg and saying that I think in Raoul Wallenberg's case, he was born humanitarian in a way,</sentence><sentence id="2677">2 because he had these feelings for always helping in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span>.</sentence><sentence id="2678">He helped the weaker children there who were terrorized by the stronger ones and all that, and it's also interesting that this one man who was with him -- his name now was Pleti (ph) or something -- who was with Raoul Wallenberg in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> when they were going to and Raoul disappeared.</sentence><sentence id="2679">And he said just as they were leaving "Oh, no, I can't follow you because I don't know where my parents are now.</sentence><sentence id="2680">I have to find them."</sentence><sentence id="2681">So he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and saved his life, of course, in doing that.</sentence><sentence id="2682">And he told the story that they met, they knew each other from the beginning from prior years in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where they were studying at the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and this little Pleti (ph) was a small little boy, Jewish, weak, and how the older people, the stronger boys, they were terrorizing him.</sentence><sentence id="2683">And then Raoul Wallenberg went straight up to him and said, "Don't be afraid.</sentence><sentence id="2684">I'll protect you."</sentence><sentence id="2685">So he protected him against the others, you see.</sentence><sentence id="2686">So having heard all these stories, I came to the conclusion that he was born the humanitarian in a way, and I told the audience that.</sentence><sentence id="2687">And if you apply that on other people on myself and so on, I don't call me humanitarian.</sentence><sentence id="2688">But if you would call me humanitarian, I would say that I became that when I was facing the situation.</sentence><sentence id="2689">That I didn't have sort of -- I wasn't born that way, I don't think so.</sentence><sentence id="2690">I can't judge myself, but we all who have faced the situation like that, how could you have done nothing?</sentence><sentence id="2691">I mean, you had to, you had to.</sentence></p></dialogue>
